LAGOS  – The Global Initiatives for Good Government (GIGG), a non-governmental organiza­tion (NGO), has called on the United States and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) to rise up and defend the sovereignty of Ukraine. A statement by Dr. Emeka Kalu, the Director-General of the group, said that by the virtues of human rights and United Nations Charter on Respect for the Defence of Sovereignty, it was absurd, abnormal and draconian for the Russian Government to invade Ukraine without minding its adverse effects on the global community. The group noted that through the series of air strikes and military offensives launched in the eastern cities of the Ukraine, scores of lives and properties worth billions of euros had been lost, while Ukraine was yet to get any external relief intervention from the powerful blocs.

The group insisted that the appeal by the UN for Russia to consider the safety of human­ity was not enough to contain the situation in the country.
