Heads of State and Government, international organizations, multilateral development banks, and employers’ and workers’ leaders from around the world will come together 22 – 24 February to discuss concrete actions to ensure a human-centred recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic. They will take part in a high-level virtual multilateral Global Forum for a Human-centred Recovery, organised by the International Labour Organization – the UN agency for the world of work. The forum, which will include an address by the UN Secretary-General António Guterres, aims to increase the level and coherence of the international response to the economic and social impact of the COVID-19 crisis. NLC Restates Support For Autonomy Of Local Governments, State… AUC, ILO Reaffirm Commitment To Strengthen Social Justice,… Participants will also discuss how to strengthen institutional arrangements to enhance the international community’s response to the devastating effects of the pandemic on people and the widening inequalities among and within countries. The Forum will provide an opportunity to advance a more effective form of multilateralism that, in the words of the UN Secretary-General, “draws together existing institutional capacities, overcoming fragmentation to ensure all are working together towards a common goal.” A key issue for discussion will be the Global Accelerator on Jobs and Social Protection for a Just Transition that the Secretary-General launched at the General Assembly in September 2021. The participants will examine the actions and investments needed to support a fully inclusive, human-centred recovery from the crisis in all countries through expansion of decent jobs and inclusive economic growth, universal social protection, worker protections and enterprise sustainability, and a just transition towards a carbon-neutral global economy.
