President of the Students Union Government (SUG) the University of Benin (UNIBEN), has revealed the reason behind the massive protest held on Wednesday. Recall that the students of UNIBEN, stormed the streets of Benin and blocked the Benin-Ore highway, protesting over the one month warning strike by the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU). According to Amadin, who led the protest, the students are tired of the incessant strikes by ASUU and decided to express their grievances.

We hereby express our grievances to the federal government, to the state government and whoever cares to listen. We say we are tired. “We want to graduate. For a programme that is supposed to run for four years, we are spending five years and even more. We don’t want it anymore. “Let the federal government see to the demands of ASUU and let ASUU also consider the federal government’s position. “All we want is to go back to our classes. I want to graduate, I want to leave the school. I am tired and that is our grievance.” Recall that ASUU declared a one-month warning strike on Monday, at the end of its National Executive Council (NEC) meeting in Lagos over the refusal of the government to implement various agreements.
