The case is in the court, we won them but they have appealed.” According to one of the governor’s aides, Aniekeme Finbarr, the governor was referring to the Atheist Society of Nigeria as witches and wizards. Recall that the Atheist Society of Nigeria had filed a lawsuit against the Akwa Ibom State Government in 2019 to stop the government from building the worship centre. However, the suit was dismissed by the court. POLL “It sounds extremely funny but it is true. There are actually real legal attempts to stop the building project,” Finbarr said.
