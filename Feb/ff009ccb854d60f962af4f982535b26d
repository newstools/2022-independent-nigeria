Following his action, the Bill was reworked by the National Assembly and both the Senate and the House of Represen­tatives passed same on January 25, 2022. While the controver­sies lasted, stakeholders from the civil society organisations had pre­vailed on the NASS to ex­punge the direct primary clause and retransmit it for assent by the presi­dent in order not to jeop­ardise the 2023 general elections. It is not clear when Buhari would append his signature to the Bill.
