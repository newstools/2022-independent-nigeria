Nike have terminated their endorsement of Manchester United and England striker Mason Greenwood, the sportswear firm has announced, citing “deep concerns” following his arrest on suspicion of rape and assault. Last week, Greenwood was released on bail pending further investigation having been further arrested on suspicion of sexual assault and making threats to kill while in police custody. At that point Nike said it was “deeply concerned by the disturbing allegations and will continue to closely monitor the situation”. In a new statement, the sportswear giant said that “Mason Greenwood is no longer a Nike athlete.” Kidnapped Kaduna Catholic Priest Regains Freedom CJN Hits Back At AGF Over Utterances Against Judiciary The 20-year-old was arrested after images showing physical abuse and videos were posted online.
