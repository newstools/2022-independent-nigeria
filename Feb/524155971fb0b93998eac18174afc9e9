BAUCHI  – The National Director of Ad­ministration and Strategy of the National Association of Ni­geria Students (NANS), Prince Mohammed Sani Hassan, has lamented the frequency of uni­versity strikes, which he said is crippling the education system of the country. He called on the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU) to listen to the govern­ment in the overall interest of Nigerian students. Mohammed Sani, who stated this during a press con­ference on Sunday in Bauchi, urged the federal government to immediately summon an emergency meeting of stake­holders in the education sector in order to proffer a lasting solu­tion to the myriad of challenges militating against smooth oper­ation of the sector particularly the lingering strikes.

It is an unar­guable discussion that a four-year course now takes not less than 7 to 8 years for a Nigerian student, who is battling tooth and nail to survive in the cur­rent economic realities.
