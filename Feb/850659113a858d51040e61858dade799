Police have launched an investigation into allegations that people associated with one of Prince Charles’ charities offered to help a Saudi billionaire secure British honors and citizenship in exchange for donations. The investigation followed a series of stories in the London Times, which reported that a long-time aide to Charles helped to secure the prince’s support for a Saudi citizen to receive British citizenship and a knighthood in return for donations of as much as £1.5 million ($2.8 million). London’s Metropolitan Police Service said on Wednesday that it had opened a formal investigation after assessing the media reports, reviewing the findings of an inquiry commissioned by the Prince’s Foundation, and looking at documents provided by the foundation.

Charles’ office, Clarence House, said there was no evidence to back up the claims. “The Prince of Wales had no knowledge of the alleged offer of honors or British citizenship on the basis of donation to his charities,” Clarence House said in a statement. The inquiry commissioned by the Prince’s Foundation, which is focused on preserving Dumfries House, an 18th-century estate in Scotland, found evidence of communication and coordination between the charity’s then-chief executive and “fixers” working to secure honors for a donor. In November, Michael Fawcett, right-hand man to Prince Charles for decades, stepped down from his role running the Prince’s Foundation. POLL The events are alleged to have taken place from 2014 to 2018. “The board of trustees is determined that lessons will be learned to ensure that, in future, our charity maintains the highest standards in all areas and always acts with integrity and probity,” the foundation said in an updated statement on its website.
