I never expected it to be safe three or four games before the end of the season but it’s all up to us,” Rangnick urged speaking to ManUtd.com “We have to put our own focus on our own games and winning games, this is what it is all about. “We are now unbeaten for 10 games although we didn’t always play on our highest possible level, and now it’s about keeping that momentum, winning the game [against Watford] and then being ready and full of confidence to play a difficult away game at Manchester City. “We are fully aware of that. But our focus now is on tomorrow’s game, and we have to try everything we possibly can physically, tactically, technically to play on the highest possible level tomorrow and beat Watford.” Roy Hodgson’s side visit Old Trafford as the German interim manager looks to avenge the defeat that cost Ole Gunnar Solskjaer his position at the helm.
