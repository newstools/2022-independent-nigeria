Real Madrid have published their squad list for Saturday’s away match against Rayo Vallecano in La Liga. REAL MADRID SQUAD LIST: Goalkeepers: Courtois, Lunin and Luis López.

Midfielders: Kroos, Modrić, Casemiro, Valverde, Lucas V., D. Ceballos, Isco and Camavinga. Attackers: Hazard, Benzema, Asensio, Jović, Vini Jr., Rodrygo and Mariano. As expected, David Alaba will miss the game with the small groin injury he picked up during Thursday’s training session. Bale is also out. Other than those two players, Real Madrid have a healthy squad and the players should be fresh enough to take on Rayo. The Vallecas team started the season overachieving and even clinched their presence in the Copa del Rey Semifinals, but they have been struggling in recent weeks and Madrid should take advantage of that, although it’s clear that Vallecas is a very tough venue to play in as the visiting team.
