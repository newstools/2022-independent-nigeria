US President Joe Biden said Thursday that he authorized the deployment of air and ground forces in Europe to the eastern flank of allies and reaffirmed the United States’ commitment to defend NATO. “We’re also taking steps to defend our NATO allies. Particularly in the east,” the President said during remarks from the White House following the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Biden continued, “Tomorrow, NATO will convene a summit. We’ll be there to bring together the leaders of 30 allied nations and close partners to affirm our solidarity and to map out the next steps we will take to further strengthen all aspects of our NATO alliance.” European Leaders Agree To A Second Wave Of Russia Sanctions Russia Bans UK Flights Over Its Airspace After Sanctions The President also made clear that US troops will not be going to Europe to “fight in Ukraine” but to defend the NATO alliance. “Although we provided over $650 million in defensive assistance to Ukraine… last year, let me say it again. Our forces are not and will not be engaged in the conflict with Russia in Ukraine, our forces are not going to Europe to fight in Ukraine but defend our NATO allies and reassure those allies in the east. As I made crystal clear, the United States will defend every inch of NATO territory with the full force of American power,” he said. The President added that he has “no doubt” that NATO members will “meet our Article 5 commitments, which says an attack on one is an attack on all.” Biden then said that he authorized “deployment of ground and air forces stationed in Europe to the eastern flank” and also is authorizing “additional US force capabilities to deploy to Germany as part of NATO’s response.”
