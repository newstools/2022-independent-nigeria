Pastor Enoch Adeboye, General Overseer of the Redeemed Christian Church of God (RCCG) has charged individuals to desist from reckless living in order to fulfill destiny. The counsel was contained in his sermon at the February Thanksgiving Service and Special Prayers for Firstborn and their families, tagged ‘Transformed Destiny’, at the Throne of Grace, RCCG National Headquarters, Ebute Metta, Lagos. He cited biblical examples of individuals who were fulfilled also those who had unfulfilled destiny due to pride, idolatry, sexual perversion and other sins which made them mess with God. Hope Renewed At INL 12th Thanksgiving Service Nigeria Can’t Progress Without Restorative Justice – BSN… Adeboye who led the congregation to seek God’s mercy for past misdeeds to having the future destroyed, noted that God controls destiny and could reform a deformed destiny as long as the individual shows remorse and disengages from evil habits. In a chat with journalists after the service, Adeboye, through Pastor Funso Odesola, Assistant General Overseer (Admin & Personnel) and Continental Overseer Africa Continent 3 (South West Nigeria and Middle East), made known that Nigeria’s destiny needed divine reformation as he lamented the lack of good roads, stable electricity, other infrastructures and social amenities. He called for collective repentance and efforts, stating partly: “Only God can do it but everybody needs to be involved, those who are in it also need transformation. We do not have roads; we do not have electricity… Quite a lot of the leaders are selfish and what they are concerned about is personal gains.”
