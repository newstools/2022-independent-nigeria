Polish Government has expressed interest in areas of cooperation with Nigerian Investment Promotion Commission (NIPC) that will interest polish investors in Nigeria. Joanna Tarnawska, Polish Ambassador to Nigeria made this known when Ag Executive Secretary/CEO, NIPC Mr Emeka Offor paid her a courtesy visit at the Polish Embassy in Abuja recently. The Ambassador, who described Nigeria as a thriving investment destination, however, noted that there was a negative perception of Nigeria by foreign media and a minor presence of Polish investors in Nigeria.

Offor, in response, assured Ambassador Tarnawska of NIPC’s support in building awareness and improving investment relations between Poland and Nigeria. According to him “What we always suggest is that prospective investors talk to NIPC first so that we can handhold them – take them through the process.” “If there are needs to take them to attend certain meetings – with regulators, other government agencies or State Governors, we will willingly handhold them and ensure that they are in safe hands,” he said. POLL Offor further stated that in line with Nigeria’s e-government initiative, NIPC launched an e-OSIC platform which grants access to NIPC’s one stop shop remotely, to further ease doing business in Nigeria.
