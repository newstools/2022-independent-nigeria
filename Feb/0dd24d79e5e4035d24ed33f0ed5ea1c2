The Anambra State Command of the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC), has stated that it will apprehend petrol station owners taking advantage of the artificial scarcity of fuel to hike the price. The State Commandant of NSCDC, Mr Evaristus Chimezie Obiyo, said the move was meant to curb worsening the situation of fuel scarcity in the state. The state commandant stated this after a monitoring tour to filling stations in the state, adding that the tour was geared at fighting against filling stations dispensing fuel above the recommended pump price of ₦165.

We are going around the state to monitor every filling station,’’ Obiyo said. The Public Relations Officer of Anambra State Command of NSCDC, DSC Edwin Okadigbo, revealed that the monitoring team, led by the Head of Anti Vandalism Squad, Assistant Commandant Dennis Reuben covered several filling stations within Awka metropolis. “The visit is to ensure compliance of sales of the commodity at the approved price, to caution them against hiking the price and to ensure that the product is sold to motorists instead of hoarding it. “Besides the astronomical rise in prices in some of the filling stations visited, the team noticed that some filling stations were shortchanging customers through under-dispensing and product hoarding,” he said.
