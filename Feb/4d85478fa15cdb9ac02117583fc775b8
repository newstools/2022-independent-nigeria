Major stakeholders in the Ni­gerian automobile industry have said the patronage of locally-built vehicles would improve the Nigerian Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and provide jobs for teeming pro­fessionals in the country. This is as the analysts laud­ed Professor Charles Soludo, the governor-elect of Anambra State, for canvassing support for locally made products, in­cluding the vehicles produced by Innoson Vehicle Manufac­turing Company Ltd {IVM}, Nnewi in Anambra State. Jelani Aliyu, the director general of the National Automo­tive Design and Development Council (NADDC), said the pa­tronage of locally-built vehicles aligned with the spirit of the National Automotive Industry Development Plan (NAIDP) of the Federal Government.

Besides, he lauded the for­mer Central Bank governor for the pronouncement, saying “it is the type of commitment needed to move Nigeria’s auto­motive industry forward.” According to him, he had always been impressed with the dedication of the Innoson plant and its founder, Chief Innocent Chukwuma, to the production of vehicles which, according to him, were of high quality standards.
