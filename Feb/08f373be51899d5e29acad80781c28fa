BENIN – A social crusader, Moses Onodua, has called on au­thorities in the petroleum industry to honour their words that “heads will roll comment” on the issue of adulterated fuel into the country to boost the confi­dence of Nigerians. He made the comment in Benin while reacting to the damage the product had caused to Nigerians’ auto­mobiles and the associated hardship it had brought on the citizens. Onodua said in other climes, if such a thing hap­pened, those in the helm of affairs where it happened would humbly tender their resignation letters and apologise to the citizens, adding that the reverse was in the case in Nigeria.
