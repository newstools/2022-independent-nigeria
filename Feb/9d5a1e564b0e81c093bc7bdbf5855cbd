Eweka stated that “The NSCDC is saddened that some citizens of a neighboring country instead of supporting our government in Nigeria in its intensive fight against illicit drugs, chose to destroy the future of our youths. “All the nine arrested suspects are Ghanaians and they used two big boats to convey the illegal substances from Ghana,” Eweka added.
