LAGOS – The Nigeria Union of Petroleum and Natural Gas Workers (NUPENG), has called for immediate halt to further release of the fund earmarked for the repairs and reconstruction of identified 21 critical roads, alleging that the officials of Ministry of Works and Housing are going around showing pictures of roads done in June and August 2021 to justify payment made from the N621 billion which was approved in October, 2021 for the roads. The Union in a statement signed by its President, Comrade Williams Akporeha, and Comrade Afolabi Olawale, General Secretary and made available to Daily Independent, threatened to commence immediate mobilisation of all its members for resumption of earlier suspended action. It also called for a competent monitoring and validation team comprising all those Stakeholders that signed the stakeholders’ Communique to evaluate the pre award pictures of the 21 identified roads taken, which will be compared with pictures of post repairs/reconstruction situation, saying: “We have our facts and figures, and we shall not be cowed into allowing the N621 billion to go same way others budgeted funds have gone”. AUC , ILO Reaffirm Commitment To Strengthen Social Justice And… CBN Appoints Kemi Christina Abdul As Board Member Of Infracorp Part of the statement read: “The leadership of our Union is seriously concerned and disturbed over the issues of safety of petroleum tanker drivers on wheels and unscrupulous moves to divert and misappropriate N621billion earmarked for the repairs and reconstruction of identified 21 critical roads. “To fully explain the reasons behind the increasing deterioration of health and safety provisions for Petroleum Tanker Drivers on the wheels and the rising number of roads and fire accidents involving the Petroleum Trucks across the Country, we understand the unfortunate situation the Transporters have found themselves. “NUPENG, as a responsible and responsive Trade Union Organization cannot afford to sit idle and watch her able bodied members continued to be wasted away as sacrificial items as well as the wanton destruction of millions of public lives and properties, so as to manage the operational costs by transporters due to inadequate freight rates being paid to them’ “Many of our members have constantly been lodging complaints of being forced to drive with worn out tyres and other unsafe vehicular parts thereby putting their safety at high risk. “More worrisome is the fact that the conditions of work of these drivers have remained same for more than Six years now and the Transporters have been foot dragging in committing to a revised collective Bargaining Agreement for the ‘Support Our Dream Conditions’ of work for the Petroleum Tanker Drivers due to high cost of operations and low freight rates”. POLL It would be recalled that at the end of the quarterly Branch Executive Council meeting of the Petroleum Tanker Drivers, held at PTD House, Emene, Enugu on September 25,2O2l, the Union issued a firm and decisive ultimatum on the deplorable state of the federal highways and the painful experiences of our members while carrying out their duties across the Country. The management team of NNPC under Mallam Mele Kyari immediately apprehended the situation then to avert the situation of industrial action of the Union, by calling the leadership of the Union to two separate meetings on October10, 2O21 in lbadan and October12, 2021 in Abuja. In attendance at the October12, 2021 were critical Stakeholders such as the FIRS, FRSC, Federal Ministry of Works and Housing, Nigeria Association of Road Transport Owners and NUPENG. These two meetings resulted into signing of communique indicating the readiness and willingness of NNPC to finance the rehabilitation of identified 21 critical roads at an estimated sum of N621billion through Road lnfrastructure Tax Credit Scheme. “On the basis of this communique, the Union suspended the intended industrial action, but we were very clear in our statement, that should the spirit and letter of the agreement not fully implemented with focus on those jointly identified critical roads or attempt is made to divert the funds, the Union will not give further warning to resume the intended actions.
