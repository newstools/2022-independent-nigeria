UEFA have confirmed that Kyle Walker will be suspended for three Champions League games following his red card against RB Leipzig. Manchester City initially declined to appeal the three-match ban that Walker was handed, but belatedly decided to after studying similar incidents and seeing that initial punishments had been reduced on appeal. However, UEFA have dismissed the appeal and reiterated that the England right-back, who missed the first leg of their last-16 clash with Sporting as a result, will also miss both the second leg and the first game in the quarter-finals.

Consequently, the UEFA Control, Ethics and Disciplinary Body’s decision of 25 January 2022 is upheld. “The CEDB had decided to suspend Manchester City FC player, Mr. Kyle Andrew Walker, for the next three (3) UEFA club competition matches for which he would be otherwise eligible, for assaulting another player.” City played John Stones at right-back for the game against Sporting this week, which they won 5-0. Guardiola admitted before the game that Aleks Zinchenko’s performance in the Norwich game had tempted him to play the Ukrainian but ultimately opted for Stones. The scoreline advantage opened up by City in Lisbon offers Guardiola the opportunity to make significant changes to his lineup for the second leg next month in Manchester, although he will expect a better performance from his team after being unsatisfied with their efforts despite the 5-0 win.
