BMW said buying a controlling stake in its Chinese car-making joint venture with Brilliance will bolster the German company’s earnings by as much as 8 billion euros ($9.1 billion). The Chinese authorities gave BMW permission to raise its stake in the business with Brilliance China Automotive Holdings to 75 per cent from 50 per cent, the automaker said in a statement, recently. The move will lead to a positive one-time effect of 7 billion euros to 8 billion euros for BMW’s main automotive segment with an increase to free cash flow of about 5 billion euros. Precise figures will be released in coming weeks. The change is effective immediately.
