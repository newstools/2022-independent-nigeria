UYO  – Solidaridad Nigeria, an inter­national solution-oriented civil organisation society has inten­sified effort to build the capacity of youths along several agricul­tural value chains. The program tagged ‘AgroEnterpreneurship’ is aimed at exposing and equip­ping young people with infor­mation and skills that would enable them to understand and benefit from the various oppor­tunities across the Oil palm sub­value chain. Speaking at the training on “Accelerating sustainable solu­tion towards speed scale depth in West Africa” in Uyo on Fri­day, the Program Manager, Oil Palm, Solidaridad in Nigeria, Mr Kenechukwu Onukwube stressed the need for youths to be involved in the production, from seedlings, nurseries, and in Palmoilprocessingandtrade.

That is consolidating on the Agro-pre­neurship.
