All the people of Ekiti have decided that they want Segun Oni on any platform. And he had harkened to the calls. In fact, it was the image of Oni that has been promoting the image of PDP in Ekiti State. And once the PDP has decided to kill itself we have to take a bow and leave. “Ekiti people will not leave Oni alone to go like that because they can’t see any other person that can deliver what Oni has been doing for them. “So, it is the voice of the people and not the voice of anybody. As it is now, both PDP and APC will be contesting against the people of Ekiti. And the symbol of the people of Ekiti State is Engr. Oni.”
