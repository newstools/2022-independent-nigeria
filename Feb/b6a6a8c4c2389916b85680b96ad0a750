OWERRI  – Amidst the ceaseless agita­tion by the Southeast for the nation’s presidential seat next year, the National Chairman of the African Democratic Con­gress (ADC) Chief Ralph Okey Nwosu has challenged critical stakeholders of the region to embark on coalition building, co-operation and collaboration with other regions to realize the project. He observed that although the population of Igbos gives them good political capital especially voting power and can as well influence election results in some states and cities in the country, their votes alone cannot produce a president in the country or give them the best of political gain. The ADC National Chair­man stated this in a keynote address entitled “Converting Numerical strength of Ndigbo into Political Capital” which he delivered at the “Igbo National Political Summit 2022” organ­ised by the Igbo National Con­gress (INC) in Owerri the Imo State capital.

Continually, the ADC Chieftain inter-alia added that the Igbo Nation would be better served if the govern­ments and Umunna invest in building more enlightened, educated, skilled and ethical population. Chilos Godsent, President of the INC, in an address earli­er explained that the primary goal of the summit was to raise the consciousness of the Igbo Nation on the urgent need to politically activate the numer­ical strength of the Igbo race in the country and also galvanize the national framework for command and control includ­ing information sharing ahead of the 2023 electoral year.
