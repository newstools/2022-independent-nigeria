LAGOS – Following up on earlier warning by Lagos State Government for trouble makers to steer clear of the metropolis, Rapid Response Squad (RRS) this afternoon arrested one of the leaders of Tricycle Owners and Operators Association of Nigeria (TOOAN), Alhaji Azeez Abiola, and four suspects for attempting to cause mayhem in Agege, just as it recovered a pump action gun in the area. They were arrested in Agege while leading a team of supporters to NURTW headquarters in Agege, an action which the authority believed would trigger violence and chaos in other parts of the metropolis.
