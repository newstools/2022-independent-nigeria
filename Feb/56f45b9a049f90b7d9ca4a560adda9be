German legend Lothar Matthaus claims Niklas Sule turned down a move to Newcastle United. The giant Bayern Munich defender was linked with the Magpies during the January transfer window after NewcastleWorld exclusively revealed talks had taken place with the player’s representatives. However, a potential move for the 26-year-old did not progress and Sule has since agreed to join Bayern’s Bundesliga rivals Borussia Dortmund on a free transfer when his contract expires this summer. Gerrard Reveals Why He Sanctioned Matt Targett’s Loan Move To… Chelsea, Dortmund In Transfer Race Over Bayern Munich Star,… Sule wasn’t short of offers, including Newcastle apparently, due to the vast amount of experience he has for club and country. “It is not about money,” Matthaus said when asked about Sule’s move to Dortmund. “Otherwise, he would have gone to England. Speaking to Sky Deutschland, Matthaus added: “He had an offer from Newcastle United, where he would have earned twice as much. “He is looking for a sporting challenge. And at Bayern he no longer felt valued. In recent years, Sule has often been attacked because of his weight and no one has protected him. POLL “During his long injury break, he sacrificed himself for the club. He won the Champions League and played great games. The club didn’t get enough. And I know that is the reason why Sule said to his team of advisors, ‘we don’t need to talk to Bayern anymore. I want to go’”. United signed five players in January – Kieran Trippier, Chris Wood, Bruno Guimaraes, Matt Targett and Dan Burn. Eddie Howe’s side are unbeaten in their last six games, lifting them four points above the Premier League relegation zone ahead of facing Brentford on Saturday.
