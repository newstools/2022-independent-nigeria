Nollywood veteran actress, Rita Edochie, has urged the federal government to the release of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB’s) leader, Nnamdi Kanu. According to the actress in a post on her Instagram page, the federal government is chasing shadows as Kanu is not responsible for any crime. She wrote: “HOW CAN THEY BE CHASING SHADOWS WHEN THEY KNOW WHO THEIR REALLY ENEMY/ ENEMIES ARE? IPOB: Judge Warns Nnamdi Kanu’s Lawyer To Stop Writing Her… IPOB: Court Grants Nnamdi Kanu Maximum Comfort In Detention “MAZI NNAMDI OKWU KANU IS NEVER YOUR PROBLEM. NOLLYWOOD IS NEVER YOUR PROBLEM BECAUSE RECENTLY YOU HAVE JOIN NOLLYWOOD IN IT. “BUT YOU ARE YOUR VERY PROBLEM AND PRACTICALLY REFUSED TO TELL YOUR SELF / SELVES THE TRUTH. “RELEASE MAZI NNAMDI OKWU KANU AND FACE THE PROBLEM YOU CREATED BY YOUR SELF/ SELVES FOR YOUR SELF/ SELVES.”
