LAGOS – Former Vice President Atiku Abubakar has said it is not compulsory for Nigerians to elect an old man as President in 2023, saying a youth in his thirties who is endowed with leadership qualities will do better. The former presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in the 2019 general elections stated this while speaking at a meeting with members of a group, ‘Let’s Fix Nigeria’ who visited him at his residence. According to him, age shouldn’t be a criterion for determining who leads the country as leadership is an endowed attribute of God.

He is from one of the other states and he said to me that: ‘you know why I support you strongly to be president?’ What are you looking for at this age? You have married finish, you don born finish. You have everything. But my fear is that if I go and give it to a young man, he may be looking for women to marry; looking for a car to buy or a house to build. Now, what are we saying?’ I laughed. “I said: ‘well, it doesn’t follow. God endows leadership. You can have a young thirty years old man and he will do better than an old man. So, leadership is an endowed attribute of God. We should try to look for such a person who has been endowed.”
