Frank Lampard has confirmed Abdoulaye Doucoure and Demarai Gray will return to Everton’s squad for Saturday’s Premier League encounter with Manchester City, however the Toffees manager is unsure whether they’ll be fit to start. Doucoure has not played since the middle of January and hasn’t featured at all since Lampard’s appointment last month, while Gray has suffered with a hip problem of late. However, both have been back in training and will provide a major boost to Lampard ahead of the champions’ trip to Merseyside this weekend.

Whether they start is an issue for me. Doucoure has been out for five weeks now,” the ex-Chelsea midfielder said in Friday’s pre-match press conference. “With Demarai, we have to make sure, coming into a game with the type of physical output needed to get the performance and potential result, it’s a big ask. “I’ll have to decide whether they’re ready to start, but they’ve been training with us for the past two or three days. It’s good to have them back in the squad.” However, there’s less positive news regarding the fitness of defender Ben Godfrey. The 24-year-old has missed the last three games with a hamstring injury and won’t be back in time for Saturday. “Ben Godfrey won’t be back,” said Lampard. “He’s progressing well but it was always going to be a five-week injury, which gives him another couple of weeks.” POLL Elsewhere for the Toffees, Fabian Delph remains out with a thigh problem, while Yerry Mina and Tom Davies are also missing through injury.
