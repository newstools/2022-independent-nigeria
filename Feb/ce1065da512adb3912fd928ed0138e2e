Everton are closing in on the signing of Chelsea legend Ashley Cole as Frank Lampard looks to add his former teammate to his backroom staff.. Lampard was appointed Blues boss on Monday and has already brought in a string of Chelsea-connected coaches in Joe Edwards, Paul Clement and Chris Jones. He wants to add Cole to that list, but the former world class left-back is currently assistant manager with England Under-21s. Barcelona Contemplate Terminating Ousmane Dembele’s Contract It Hurts To Leave Without A Real Goodbye, Aubameyang Tells Fans The Daily Mail report that talks have been ongoing between Everton and Cole over the last 48 hours and the club is confident that a deal is close. It looks likely that the 41-year-old will take up a coaching role at Goodison Park, but whether he can remain in work with the national team is yet to be seen. Lampard’s first game in charge of the Toffees is at Goodison Park on Saturday against Brentford in the FA Cup fourth round and he has already been leading training ahead of the clash with the Bees. The new manager’s backroom team also includes Everton stalwarts Duncan Ferguson and Alan Kelly, who have remained on from the previous regime.
