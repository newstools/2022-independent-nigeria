Insurers in the continent have been urged to sign up to the Nairobi Declaration on Sustainable Insurance as a first step towards creating a sustainable insurance industry and to build resilience for the continent as a whole. Kelvin Massingham, Director – Risk and Resilience at FSD Africa, while speaking at a breakfast briefing for insurance CEOs in Nairobi, was quoted as saying that there are contributions insurers can make to the climate change and in producing better outcomes for Africa as a whole. He stressed the importance of all businesses across Africa in engaging with the net-zero ambitions.

For insurers, that can be helping farmers with solutions to drought, making sure the finance is in place to help recovery.” Mr Massingham also pointed out: “We are the most vulnerable continent and are home to 30 out of the world’s 40 most vulnerable countries. By 2050, Africa’s GDP will contract 30per cent if no action is taken on carbon emissions. Currently, a lot of African countries are already losing about 10per cent due to catastrophic events.” The insurance industry exists to increase resilience, he said, so will play a vital role in building a sustainable environment for the future. According to report, Mr Massingham encouraged insurers to identify the needs of customers and develop solutions to meet their needs and deliver greater resilience. But he added that insurers also have a key role in pointing capital to where it is needed most. “Project finance doesn’t exist without insurance,” he said.
