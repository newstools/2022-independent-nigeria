Popular Nigerian disc jockey, Florence Otedola, aka DJ Cuppy has shared strong opinion on the issue of education. In a clip which she shared on her Instagram page, Cuppy noted that she believes education is literally the only tool we can use to progress the world. According to her, driven by this belief, she opted to seek further education despite a thriving career as a DJ and a musician. “I’m studying at the moment at Oxford University. I’m doing a Masters on African studies. And it’s really interesting because as much as that’s a good thing, it feels like I’m studying my continent outside of my continent and that has always been quite an interesting dynamic. But what I will say is that even as Africans, there’s so much we don’t know about ourselves. And being in Oxford has completely changed my epistemology,” she said.

That’s because right from a young age, young people are not aware of historical dynamics. They are not aware of these conversations,” she added. Sometime last year, the ‘Jollof on the Jet’ croner took her fans and followers by surprise when she announced that she would be resuming classes at the prestigious Oxford University for a Masters programme. In October of 2021, the billionaire daughter shared evidence of her matriculation on her social media page. The musician shared photos of herself in a black and white outfit with a matriculation cap to match. In one of the photos, she had a bouquet of flowers in one hand and her cap in another.
