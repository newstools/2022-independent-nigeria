IBADAN – The People’s Democratic Party (PDP), Oyo State chapter has replied Alhaji Bisi Olopoeyan over his comment against Governor Seyi Makinde on Tuesday saying that any attempt to alter history for political reasons would be an effort in futility. Olopoeyan, who is a factional leader of aggrieved members of the ruling party in the state had on Tuesday fumed at one of PDP chieftains in the state, Diran Odeyemi over his comment that it was needless for anyone to contest against Governor Makinde come 2023 as the unprecedented performance of the governor within a short period in office is enough to secure another term for him. Shocked by Olopoeyan’s condemnation of Odeyemi’s comment, the PDP warned Olopoeyan to desist from seeking cheap public attention like a toddler seeking his mother’s attention for breast milk urging him to be man enough to declare his political interest in the opposition party known adding that no true born and legitimate son of a family would wage war against his own household no matter the circumstance. Makinde Approves Appointment Of 42nd Olubadan I’ll Go To Court, If You Fail To Run In 2023, Physically… According to a press release by the Oyo state PDP Publicity Secretary, Akeem Olatunji, and made available to pressmen on Wednesday, February 23, everything Olopoeyan has continued to do and say against Makinde at every given forum is nothing short of brazen antiparty but the party in its resolve not to close the window of peaceful resolution has continued to tolerate and endure all the vituperation coming from Olopoeyan. The ruling party maintained that everything Olopoeyan said against Diran Odeyemi’s unarguable comment about Makinde’s starling performance is a clear manifestation of the proverbial dog that may get lost by not listening to the sound of the whistle of the hunter advising all those journeying with Olopoeyan on what the party described as ‘path of political perdition’ to have a rethink before it’s too late. The Oyo state PDP dared Olopoeyan to tell the world in specific terms exactly what his grievances against Makinde are. The party maintained that it is on record how the then defunct Action Congress of Nigeria (ACN) deployed the instrumentality of false propaganda and campaign of calumny using the NURTW crisis at the time to blackmail the late Governor Alao Akala government to win the 2011 election. The ruling party in the state also maintained that it is also public knowledge how Late Governor Abiola Ajimobi and the All Progressives Congress (APC) were rejected by the good people of the state who were made to live like slaves and slave masters under a draconian emperor at the time forgetting that sovereignty and the ultimate source of political power remain with the same people. According to the PDP in Oyo State, the APC era was the worst thing that ever happened to Oyo since creation and realizing that fact, the people were quick to show them the way out never to return or at least not in the near future since the people have tested both PDP and APC and agreed to settle for PDP seeing that it is the only true political party with the masses at the centre of every one of its policies and programs. POLL “Everything APC government did in terms of policies and programs were not only wasteful and unsustainable for themselves during their own tenure but also showed how incompetent and grossly incapable they were being in government. From the YES-O scheme to the billions of naira spent on non-existing flowers across the Ibadan metropolis, to substandard road construction at a flat rate of about one billion naira per kilometre regardless of soil geophysical survey and textures. “The unaccounted 50 billion health endowment fund is there till date as well as billions of naira Agribusiness fund received from the government of former President Goodluck Jonathan to develop the state agricultural sector, yet absolutely nothing to show for it, non-payment of workers salaries for over one year as well as pension and gratuities of retirees leading to permanent physical disabilities and avoidable deaths by those who served the state meritoriously, and so many more too numerous to mention. “So, if these are the standards of Olopoeyan and his likes to define good governance by late Ajimobi, then the world already know why APC has been overwhelmingly rejected by the good people of Oyo state who deserve nothing but the good governance being enjoyed under the leadership of Governor Makinde. “The days of giving credence to whatever Olopoeyan says is long gone because a man who claimed to be a member of our great party and would go on radio and different fora to declare public support for APC aspirants as against the PDP can not be said to be anything short of a mole whose primary aim and objective is to remain in PDP and cause as many damages as possible before finally joining his APC friends. “Olopoeyan has with his words and conducts justified our position that Makinde’s approach to governance which is contrary to what was obtainable in the era of free sharing of state resources among privileged few without being challenged against the general wellbeing of the masses was one of the core reasons why the unbridled hatred and endless antagonistic behaviours by those enemies within have festered.

In Yoruba proverb, only a bastard child points to his father’s house with a left hand so, when you see a child exhibiting those traits and behaviours, go and find out, such child is not a true born of the family or has found another family that accommodates such illegitimacy. “Olopoeyan and his cohort on the journey of political perdition have continued to ignore the whistle of the hunter and every voice of reason for very personal, selfish, and antipeople desires that are unacceptable to us, and we dare him to tell the world in specific terms what his problem(s) with Governor Makinde is or are. “It was the political template of propagating falsehood and political blackmail which was deployed by the defunct ACN in 2011 and replicated at the national level after the APC amalgamation in 2015, and perhaps, because it worked for them both times, they have assumed that they can continue to fool the people continuously which was why the opposition party is using Olopoeyan as their mole in our party to continue to disturb the peace, unity, and tranquillity in our party ahead of 2023. “Unfortunately for him and for them in the opposition party, we are ahead of their gimmicks and political plans and the most interesting part is that the good people of Oyo state with whom lies the source of sovereign political power already know them for what they are and will never again make the mistake of allowing a group of persons with a desperate and insatiable thirst for power and access to the state treasury to mislead or misinform them for political gains. “What Diran Odeyemi said was a true reflection of the fact that is unarguable and if Olopoeyan and any other person feel otherwise, then when the time comes, the good people of Oyo state will decide but in the meantime, we urge Olopoeyan who has never been a ward Councilor let alone state lawmaker or ever appointed as a member of the state cabinet to hold his peace and stop embarrassing himself before the world.” The party said.
