Note that in Q4 ‘21 an average daily oil production of 1.50 million barrels per day (mbpd) was recorded, 0.06mbpd lower than the 1.56mbpd recorded in the similarly quarter of 2020, and 0.07mbpd lower than 1.57mbpd recorded in Q3 ‘21.

This rate was 3.05% point higher than the rate recorded in similar period of 2020, and 0.71% point lower than the Q3 ‘21 records.

You would have noticed the seeming profit taking in highly capitalized stocks, in the face of mixed sentiment and buying interests in blue chips companies with consistent records of dividend payment. I Only Traffic Laughter, Comedian De General Says NGX Hits 14 Years High On Bargain Hunting, Buying Interest In… Market breadth was significantly positive on a very high traded volume, which indicates accumulation of position by investors and traders as portfolio repositioning persists ahead of more corporate numbers as the market looks for direction. Noteworthy also is the fact that investors and fund managers are continuing their search for greater returns on their investment, which is likely to drive funds to blue-chips as companies announce their dividend payout plans. The mixed sentiment in the face of market volatility continued as the benchmark index closed slightly higher, amid the ongoing volatility which comes with the earnings reporting season. Here, we advise that investors and traders should allow their stop-loss and profit targets guide them, while removing every atom of emotion. Technically, the NGX’s index action, pulled back slightly on selloffs in high priced stocks but traded above the 47,000 mark, signaling a change in momentum and trend as index actions and indicators are becoming bearish and mixed, looking the same direction in the midst of mixed sentiments on a high traded volume. Investors need to watch this, as funds are not flowing into the market as expected. Trade metrics for the session, however, revealed a decrease in profit-taking, ahead of corporate actions hitting the market any moment from now, while some stocks like Learn Africa, RT Briscoe, Fidelity Bank and NNFM, among others hit their new 52-week highs at the close of trading.

Momentum indicators are looking down, as the ADX reads 41.59. The RSI closed above 50 at 80.32 and Money Flow Index sliding to 67.60 points on the weekly time frame. The continuation of this trend depends largely on the interplay of market forces and flow of funds into the equity space, as direction of fixed income market yields remains unclear with rates not rising as expected.

However, the week’s slowdown was driven by selloffs in Seplat, MTNN, Zenith Bank, NGXGroup, vitafoam, Eterna, Custodian Investment and CWG, among others.

Market Outlook We expect mixed trend as players digest the 3.98% growth in 2021Q4 GDP and expectation of more 2021 audited financials with corporate actions to boost positive vibes during this earnings season, amid the continued interpretation of other positive economic data released recently, in the midst of profit-taking and portfolio rebalancing. This will result in market players targeting fundamentally sound and dividend paying stocks in hope of dividend announcements, as oil trades at $95pb, just as inflation rate moderates at 15.60%, while the International Monetary Fund is calling for hike in interest rate and further devaluation of Naira. Meanwhile, market players continue to digest the quarterly and unaudited 2021 full-year results available in the market and what is happenings in fixed income market after the NGX index pulled back slightly to trade above its 50-Day Moving Average on a low sell volume in the face of assets rebalancing and the changing patterns in February as the investors look forward to more audited 2021 earnings reports. The relatively low volume traded in the midst of volatility and recovery moves are creating new buy opportunities on the strength of corporate numbers and economic data. Also, candlestick formation and volume traded during the session shows that institutional players are not buying yet. It is equally noteworthy that during a ranging market many players sit on the fence waiting for a breakout, or down before jumping into any position. Even so, many stocks are trading within their buy ranges, a situation expected to attract more funds into the stock market, given the Dividend Yield capable of serving as a hedge against inflation.
