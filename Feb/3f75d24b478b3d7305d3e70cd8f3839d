The Nigerian Importers In­tegrity Association (NIIA) has accused some private jetties operating in the mari­time domain of carrying out illegal container terminal operations. The association has called on the Nigerian Ports Author­ity (NPA) and other agencies, including the Nigeria Cus­toms Service (NCS), Nation­al Inland Waterways Author­ity (NIWA) and the Nigerian Maritime Administration and Safety Agency (NIMA­SA) to halt the activities of unregulated private jetties and oil service centres that have converted their facilities to container terminals. The president of the associ­ation, Godwin Onyekazi, said some private jetties operating on the Kirikiri channel and oil service facilities now engage in handling containers.

It is not clear who licensed these barge operators and the jetties, if these barges and jetties are registered with all relevant authorities and finally if they are paying the statutory dues to NPA and all other govern­mental agencies.”
