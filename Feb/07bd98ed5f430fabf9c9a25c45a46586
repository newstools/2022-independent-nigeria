Few days after Concerned Northern Forum called for the removal of the management of Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNPC) Ltd over the importation and distribution of contaminated fuel, the forum has withdrawn its stance. A statement jointly signed by Mallam Ibrahim Bature and Comrade Abdulsalam Moh’d Kazeem, Chairman and Spokesperson, Concerned Northern Forum, respectively, alleged that some unscrupulous elements in the country had attempted to hijack its position for political gains. But the group, which said that its position on the contaminated fuel had no political colouration, said that its call was borne out of patriotism over the hardship occasioned by the scarcity of premium motor spirit (PMS) and the huge economic impact of the bad fuel on the dwindling revenue of the government. 2023: S-South APC Lawmakers Endorse Yahaya Bello For President FG Meets ASUU Today Over Warning Strike The forum, however, said that it supported the call for the thorough investigation into the matter as ordered by President Muhammadu Buhari, calling on the security agencies to conclude the probe in good time and sanction all those responsible. The statement said: “Following the operational error of methanol in PMS above our national specification, which remains an unforeseen problem, we back the call for thorough investigation as ordered by President Muhammadu Buhari and urge security agencies to conclude the probe in good time and sanction all those responsible. “We commend the management of the NNPC Ltd for taking prompt action by alerting the nation on the bad fuel and for taking measured steps to recall the bad product and injecting over 700 million litres and the promise of additional 2.1 billion litres to address the shortfall. “We withdraw our notice for the sack of the NNPC management and nationwide protest, but remain committed to the sanctioning of the importing companies and their officials.” The forum also demanded that the regulatory and security agencies ensured that fuel stations sell at the maximum installed capacity and in the event any station is found wanting, the product be dispensed free to motorists and such station sealed.
