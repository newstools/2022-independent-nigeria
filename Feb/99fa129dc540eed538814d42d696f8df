LAGOS – Lawmaker Representing Egbeda/Ona-Ara Federal Constituency at the House of Representatives, Hon. Oloye Akin Alabi has revealed that he hates the art of writing. According to the investor and best selling author who is also the Chairman, House of Representatives Committee On Governmental Affairs, he would rather read what someone else has written than take the pain to write one. However, he resigned to fate by concluding that in his opinion, though writing is a boring enterprise to embark on, he still does it. “I hate writing. I will rather read what someone else wrote. It’s such a boring thing to do. But I still do it nonetheless. You don’t have to enjoy everything you do. There is something called “Grind”, he wrote on his official twitter handle, @akinalabi.
