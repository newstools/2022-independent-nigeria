ABUJA – Amidst the postponement of the All Progressives Congress (APC) national Convention, the former Governor of Bauchi state, Barr. Mohammed Abubakar, has urged party stakeholders to remain calm and reassert faith and commitment to the party. Barr. Abubakar told stakeholders of the APC in Abuja that “the moment is quite trying for our party, but the voice of reason is for party stakeholders to remain calm and reassert faith and commitment to the party, as such a disposition will enable His Excellency, President Muhammadu Buhari and the APC Caretaker and Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC) to safely navigate the party out of the current situation into victory in 2023.” He stated further that “political parties the world over go through turbulences, but core party loyalists are always tolerant, pragmatic, centrist, eager and more focused on the larger interest of the party than any individual or group interests.” 2023: I Will Run For Governorship In Niger – Malagi Wike Gets Fresh Appointment From PDP, APC Kicks Advising party members to align their interests behind the larger interest of the party, Abubakar said, “in the circumstances, the larger interest of the party is the 2023 general election, and we all need to align our interests behind this ‘larger interest’, taking into full cognizance the ideology, vision and history of the APC, as well as the geography of the country, the needs of the Nigerian people, and the cultural and ethnic make-up of citizens, among others. “With such an array of considerations, we would be inspired to tap into various think tanks for ideas that can reposition the APC for seamless victory in a competitive political environment.” The former governor called on all citizens to put national interest above other considerations as the country approaches another election season.
