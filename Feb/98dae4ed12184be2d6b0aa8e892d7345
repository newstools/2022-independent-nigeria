The surgeon who operated on Victor Osimhen’s facial fractures reveals the Napoli and Nigeria striker required ‘six plaques and 18 screws’ to repair the ‘devastating’ damage.

The kinetic force generated by the crushing of Osimhen’s face against the back of Skriniar’s head did devastating damage. “In order to repair the fractures, I had to insert six plaques and up to 18 screws.” Although the figure given for a full recovery is 90 days, Osimhen’s surgeon warns it is still too early to tell the full effects of this injury.
