The African Union Commission (AUC) and International Labour Organization (ILO) have reaffirmed their cooperation and partnership by signing an Agreement aimed at improving the world of work and employment in Africa. The new partnership agreement, between the AU and the ILO, was recently signed in a virtual ceremony on the margins of the 40th Ordinary Session of the African Union Executive Council, in Addis Ababa, by Cynthia Samuel-Olonjuwon, the ILO Assistant Director-General and Regional Director for Africa, and H.E. Minata Cessouma Samate, the African Union Commissioner for Health, Humanitarian Affairs and Social Development. The Agreement reflects a mutual commitment for closer collaboration between the two organizations for the realization of social justice, through the promotion of decent work; encompassing international labour standards, labour migration governance for development and integration, inclusive economic growth, skills development, employment, industrial relations, social protection and social dialogue. It aims to intensify collaboration between the AU and the ILO, on a non-exclusive basis, in areas of common interest and to establish the arrangements necessary for the implementation of the agreed areas of collaboration.
