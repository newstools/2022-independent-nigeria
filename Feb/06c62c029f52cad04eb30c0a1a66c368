The Winter transfer market window has closed in most countries, but not everywhere. There are a couple of days left in Switzerland. Basel are trying to take advantage of them and asked Juventus for Kaio Jorge on loan. The striker is considering the proposal, Calciomercato.com reports. The 20-year-old has played just 124 minutes across five appearances off the bench with the first team so far. He has bagged his lone goal while featuring with the U-23 side after shaking off an early thigh injury, his only start in Italy so far. Juventus are open to letting Kaio Jorge move to Basel for the next six months to gain experience. Coach Massimiliano Allegri recently admitted that the striker could have joined Sassuolo in January. However, he turned it down to stay in Turin. It remains to be seen whether he will change his mind in this case.
