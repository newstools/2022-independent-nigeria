He remains undaunted to serve his community in a capacity as a man of the people. His intention to represent the enterprising people of Kogi-East in the next 10th Senate come 2023 will not wane. He is under the auspices of the Peoples’ Democratic Party (PDP.) Gregarious Victor Adoji is very relentless about his ambition, and he has all it takes to make his dream come true. Although many pundits are yet to come to terms with his ambition to occupy that seat in the upper house of the National Assembly come 2019, DVAA, as he is fondly referred to in the media terrain, has remained silent and albeit fastidious. Going by the resilient ways he has been going about meeting stakeholders and decision-makers in the political arena of Kogi State, DVAA may just be on a roller coaster. He has virtually been putting veritable mechanisms in place to make his silent dream come to pass. The erudite banker-turned politician is regarded as a generous man, who has affected many lives both in the state and in other parts of the country, most especially in the corporate world, where he holds sway. His aspiration to contest for Kogi East Senatorial District of the state is borne out of his zeal to enhance development in the state.
