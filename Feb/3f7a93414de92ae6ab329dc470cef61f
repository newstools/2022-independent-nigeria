We knew he hadn’t played much but this is the second game he’s started,” he said. “He’s a fabulous player and having him in the squad is a real luxury for us.” The Spain international also spoke about the game in general and his team’s performance. “It’s been an important win today. Especially in the first half we were very effective and it gave us the control of the game and the calm to continue playing our style, find free men, and we played a good game in general,” he added. “Valencia is very intense, they play the second ball very well, as was seen in the goal, but afterwards we played well and were faithful to our style and we played a very complete game.” POLL Barca now head off to Napoli for another crucial match.
