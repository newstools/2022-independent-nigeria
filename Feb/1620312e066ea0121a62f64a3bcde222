A vote is expected to follow later in the weekend. Linda Thomas-Greenfield, the US ambassador at the United Nations, said they would “hold Russia to account for its indefensible actions and for its violations of the UN Charter.” The session comes after the Security Council failed to agree a resolution on the crisis in Ukraine because it blocked by Russia, which wields a veto as a permanent member. Lapid also said that his country was exploring the effect that sanctions on Russia might have upon Israel, where a large minority is Russian-speaking and retains close links to the country.
