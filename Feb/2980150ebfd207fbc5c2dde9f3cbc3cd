The needs are growing as we speak,” said Janez Lenarcic, European Commissioner for Humanitarian Aid and Crisis Management “So for the humanitarian situation overall, the currently expected number of displaced Ukrainians is over 7 million,” he told a news conference in Brussels after a special meeting of EU member states’ interior ministers to discuss the crisis.
