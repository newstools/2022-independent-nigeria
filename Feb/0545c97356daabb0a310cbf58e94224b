The Chairman of APC in Cross River, Alphonsus Ogar, complained that Wike is fond of meddling in the affairs of the state through political cannibalism. Ogar told newsmen that the maturity of Governor Ben Ayade in handling previous matters has prevented the outbreak of violence but this time around, they won’t fold their arms and allow Wike to cross the line again. POLL He said: “Nyesom Wike has been a constant meddlesome interloper and today we want to say that enough is enough. He was here on Saturday to incite violence in Cross River State but it took the maturity of our leader and governor, Professor Ben Ayade to avert violence. “What he has set to do overtime is to import the political cannibalism from Rivers State politics into Cross River State. We will no longer continue to allow him to cross the boundary of the line of political decency.”
