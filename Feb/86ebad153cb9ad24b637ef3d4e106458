ABUJA – The presidency, through the Senior Special Assistant on Media and Publicity to the President, Garba Shehu, has reacted to criticism from the Financial Times of London. David Piling had in an article in the Financial Times of January 31, 2022, questioned the real essence of the Nigerian government in which he also described the government of sleepwalking into disaster. But in taking on Piling, Shehu said, “We wish to correct the wrong perceptions contained in the article “What is Nigeria’s Government For,” by David Piling, Financial Times (UK), January 31, 2022. Okorocha Declares For Presidency, Pledges To Surpass Buhari In… CSOs Give NASS, Presidency Jan 21 Deadline To Sign Electoral Act… The caricature of a government sleepwalking into disaster (What is Nigeria’s government for? January 31, 2022 ) is predictable from a correspondent who jets briefly in and out of Nigeria on the same British Airways flight he so criticises. He said Piling highlighted rising banditry in Nigeria as proof of such slumber but failed to reel out the security gains made over two Presidential terms. The presidential aide reminded Financial Times that the terror organisation, Boko Haram used to administer an area the size of Belgium at the inauguration; but currently, nothing of such exist. “The first comprehensive plan to deal with decades-old clashes between nomadic herders and sedentary farmers – experienced across the width of the Sahel – has been introduced: pilot ranches are reducing the competition for water and land that drove past tensions. “Banditry grew out of such clashes. Criminal gangs took advantage of the instability, flush with guns that flooded the region following the Western-triggered implosion of Libya. POLL “The situation is grave. Yet as with other challenges, it is one that the government will face down,”the media aide told Financial Times.
