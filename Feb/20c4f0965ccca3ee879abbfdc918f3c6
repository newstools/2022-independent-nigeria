Lagos – Bishop Wale Oke, President, Pentecostal Fellowship of Nigeria (PFN), has said God would raise young leaders to rewrite the history of Nigeria, while chiding corrupt leaders who divert public funds for personal gains. The founder and Presiding Bishop of Sword of The Spirit Ministries International spoke on Thursday at the 12th annual thanksgiving service of Independent Newspapers Limited (INL), tagged ‘Lift Up Your Heads O Ye Gates’, held at its corporate headquarters in Lagos. Oke, represented by Archbishop Joseph Ojo of Calvary Kingdom Church and National Chairman, State Inauguration Committee of Pentecostal Fellowship of Nigeria (PFN), at the special event organised by the INL Christian Fellowship, linked the selfishness of many Nigerian leaders to the present predicament of the nation. The guest minister, however, asked Nigerians not to fret but to see through the eyes of faith and be patriotic, as God was at work and would cause them to surmount insecurity and other challenges. On the 2023 general elections, Oke called on the Nigerian electorate, particularly Christians, not to be docile but to be actively involved and choose wisely. 2023 Presidency: Sanwo-Olu Urges APC Leaders To Unite For Tinubu Buhari Consulting Over Re-Amended Electoral Bill — Aide “There is hope, change is coming; I believe it with all my heart that insecurity will be a thing of the past very soon. I am sure because God is at work. We should lift our heads and see insecurity and see beyond bandits and Boko Haram. Some of us have the eyes of faith. “When the servant of Elisha told him that we perish, he said, ‘do not be afraid, those that be for us are more than those that be against us.’ So there are forces working in favour of this country more than the forces that we think are challenging us. I believe there is hope. “Nigerians should not be selfish; they should be patriotic; we see selfishness in many of our leaders, and they want to amass wealth for their family, no matter what, forgetting that what they amass would dwindle after their demise. God is raising a crop of leaders that are patriotic. If our leaders are patriotic, definitely changes will come,” Oke stated. He added, “The 2023 general election is in the hands of God because He rules in the affairs of men and gives to whomever He wills. God is in charge of this country. The politicians should look beyond their tenure and leave a legacy that others will emulate. POLL I believe God will raise young people that have never been politicians and give them the spirit to rewrite the history of this country.”
