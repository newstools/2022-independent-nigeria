Oyinkan Somorin The National Association of Nigerian Students (NANS) has appealed to the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU) and the Federal Government to resolve their differences so as not to embark on the impending indefinite strike set to take place this month. The association is upset over the manner in which the unprecedented strike made by ASUU has turned Nigerian students to sacrificial lamb in their fight with the Nigerian government since 2009 due to the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) reached between both parties that were never implemented.

He said: “It is our belief that this strike is not in any way beneficial to the Nigerian students’ populace but it is rather a means to unnecessarily disrupt the academic space through unending strike action that has no bearing. “Though we understand the fact that the educational sector is in a pitiable state, the manner in which the ASUU strike is being conducted does not show any form of seriousness from the union. All the strike action does is to truncate the academic calendar across institutions without any meaningful result to the students. “”We hereby appeal to both parties to resolve this quarterly ASUU strike finally as soon as possible, before Nigerian students are left with no option than to take to the street as the world is watching.” Samson commended the Lagos State Governor, Babajide Olushola Sanwo Olu, the Special Adviser to the Governor on Education, Tokunbo Wahab, Senior Special Assistant on Tertiary Institution, Tayo Sanyaolu and the Speaker, Mudashiru Obasa, for playing leading roles in maintaining peace in all tertiary institutions in the state, especially in the recent NANS JCC Lagos election.
