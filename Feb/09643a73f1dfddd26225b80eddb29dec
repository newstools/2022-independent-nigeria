Self-styled investigative journalist, Kemi Olunloyo has stated that Tacha of Big Brother Naija is suffering from depression. According to her, though Tacha may mask the pain inside with smiles, but at some point, things may become overwhelming. She wrote; “Tacha of #BBNaija is suffering from depression. Smiles may hide pain inside when things become overwhelming. If you need help see a psychiatrist. Mental health is really important. Untreated depression leads to suicide. Take care of yourself Tacha.” Tacha is known to have an army of followers who always rise to her defence when issues like this arise. Reacting to Olunloyo’s post, a Twitter user, @akhigbe_ judith noted that it is an infringement of Tacha’s privacy, noting that the claim is baseless.

There’s no claim stating that she is in fact suffering from depression, and even if she is, posting this here is a violation of her private life. You’re engaging in computerised ‘aproko’ and tagging it as journalism. Another user, @feggeborn laughed off Olunloyo’s claim, describing her a pot calling a kettle black. “Escapee from mental asylum is telling a sense person to go to psychiatric hospital. When I heard that if u confront a mad person he/she will first call u mad person I thought it was a joke but today I have seen in reality,” Feggeborn wrote. Although Tacha is yet to respond to Olunloyo’s post, she made a veiled comment that may pass for a response. She wrote on Instagram; “The woman who’s hustling can never understand the woman who’s hating. We don’t speak the same language.”
