Antonio Conte weighed in on his start at Tottenham: “I am happy for the way we are working and for the infrastructures I have found. We are trying to improve in all areas. I have realized that it will take time and patience. We have several players at their first season in the Premier League.” The gaffer commented on their January acquisitions in an interview to Sky: “The club did the best they could at the time. It was hard to sign Rodrigo Bentancur and Dejan Kulusevski, but they are ideal prospects. We are looking for youngsters to groom. This is the vision of the club, and it will not change.” Conte was asked whether he thinks Inter will win Scudetto and if the current Tottenham share some similarities to his first year in Milan: “Yes, they will be victorious. It is hard to draw a comparison. When you join a team that has not won in a long time, you lack confidence. You get down in the downs at the first hurdle, and the negativity mounts. They have been a midtable club for years.” Ghana, Rwanda, Senegal Partner BioNTech to Produce Vaccines Labor Market Dominates U.S. Earnings Calls -Goldman Kostin “It is a different situation for me, as the ambition is not to be successful right away. But I am not scared of the work that is ahead of us. Taking over mid-season is not easy. I had done it just once and promised myself I would not do it again. However, there is always the desire to put yourself out there, even in difficult situations like this one.” Conte showed some dissatisfaction with how Tottenham operated in January: “Four important players left, and we signed two. Numerically speaking, we got weaker, and I did not expect that. We changed a lot in the last two windows, which does not help.”
