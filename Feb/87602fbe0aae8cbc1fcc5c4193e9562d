The group further revealed that their plan of action for success would include doing things differently by adopting innovative approach to their activities such as organisation, mobilisation, funding advocacy, training and problem-solving in particular development issues peculiar to Nigeria. POLL “We are ready to take our future in our own hands, set agenda for the next President, hold him accountable and produce the next president,” they affirmed.

Speaking on behalf of the media team, Hon. Lanre Oyegbola stressed that youths played vital roles in the sustenance of Nigeria’s democracy and as such, must take leading positions in local and national politics.

Our conviction is that the time is now for the youths to take their rightful position in national politics and leadership. So, as youths we aim to use this opportunity to gather under one roof to network and develop a roadmap for youth inclusiveness ahead of the 2023 general elections. I urge Nigerians to support this noble cause by the youth.” The festival hosted the zazzu crooner Portable, Airboy and the fuji maestro Saheed Osupa, amongst other celebrities and Nollywood stars.
