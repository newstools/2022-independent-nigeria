In our strong opinion, somebody who, by right and constitutionally, should fly the flag of PDP come 2023 is Kalu Idika Okwara. “He is from Ohafia in Abia North. Who else is better than him? We are convinced that he can reshape and return Abia to its economic prominence. Adopting him therefore as a consensus candidate will bring Abia to desired socioeconomic status,” he added. The group argued that the Ohafia clan had never produced a governor in the state and appealed that Okwara be adopted as the sole candidate if PDP must win the election. They also claimed that Ohafia played a very prominent role in midwifing emergence of Governor Okezie Ikpeazu and has given him 100 per cent support since he was elected.
