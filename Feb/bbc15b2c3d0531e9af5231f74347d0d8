Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan on Friday appointed the head of the country’s media watchdog as a board member to the Press Advertising Agency (BİK), a state body that distributes the advertisements of the public sector in the media. Ebubekir Şahin, the head of Turkish Radio and Television Supreme Council (RTÜK), is one of 12 people appointed as board members to BİK, according to a notice in the Official Gazette, Cumhuriyet newspaper reported. Saadet Oruç, an advisor to Erdoğan, is also among those appointed to the agency’s board, the newspaper said.

The BİK General Assembly had been unable to convene for year due to the board member vacancies, Cumhuriyet said, noting that Turkey’s main opposition leader had brought the issue up earlier this month during a parliamentary meeting with lawmakers from his Republican People’s Party (CHP). Because the 12 seats, filled by presidential appointment since 2018, remained vacant, BİK’s General Assembly has been unable to convene to address advertising rates, the newspaper cited the CHP leader as saying. In 2019, Şahin resigned from the executive board of Türksat, the only communications satellite operator in Turkey, after coming under fire over receiving multiple salaries from public institution. The RTÜK chairman in 2020 was appointed as a board member to the state-owned Halkbank.
