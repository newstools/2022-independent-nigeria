The UN Security Council is scheduled to meet in an emergency session on February 27 to vote on whether to refer a resolution opposing Russia’s invasion of Ukraine to the General Assembly. Russia on February 25 blocked the move with its veto in a Security Council vote. Permanent members Russia, the United States, Britain, France, and China hold veto power in the Security Council.

No vetoes are allowed, making it likely to proceed to the General Assembly. In the failed February 25 vote that Russia vetoed, China, India, and the United Arab Emirates abstained. The remaining 11 members voted in favor. The gathering will mark the fourth time that the Security Council will have met in the past week in an emergency session over Russia’s aggression against Ukraine.
