The Former Care Taker Chairman of Ipokia Local Government, Hon Joel Bankole who shared his concern over the border closure, demanded the opening of the border, stating, “We demand the official opening of the International Border and petrol filling stations in the border areas to lessen the hardship faced and not just the physical repairs of the border post. The Federal Government should consider us that we are Nigerians too and it is not a sin living in the border area.” Moreso, Mr Taiwo Obanla, PRO, Ikolaje Idiroko Youth and Ipokia Local Government Youths’ Forum, also shared his view on the negative effects of the border closure, pleading that, “The Federal government should please open the border because it has affected many lives, some are dead, economy crippled, even some youths are now drug addicts because their means of livelihood has been paralyzed.
