MINNA – Hoodlums have attacked the family compound of the new Village Head of Lambata in Gurara Local Government Area of Niger State, Alhaji Mohammed Abdusafur Lambatta and property valued at several millions of Naira destroyed. The attackers armed with dangerous weapons including cutlasses and sticks invaded the house of the new Village Head and started vandalising every visible facility including the roofing of the palace. Certified that they have caused reasonable harm to the property, the hoodlums carrying placards with different inscriptions condemning the traditional ruler later went wild, blocking the Lambata-Minna-Suleja Road and the Lambata-Lapai-Bida axis of the road and thereby obstructing vehicular movements and subjecting commuters to gridlock. The hoodlums, according to a source from the area, were protesting the appointment of a new village head, a man who is said not to be the popular choice for Lambata people by the Emir of Suleja, Mallam Awwal Ibrahim.
