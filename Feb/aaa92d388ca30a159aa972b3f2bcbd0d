LAGOS – Chief Bode George, former national deputy chairman of the Peoples Democratic  Party (PDP) has said that the much debated, much discussed and  much delayed Electoral Bill finally signed into law on Friday morning by President Muhammadu Buhari is a right step in the right direction. The Atona Odua of Yorubaland said that the action  is a triumph for all Nigerians and for all advocates of genuine representative governance. He said, “I congratulate President Buhari for being courageous and forward looking enough to append his signature to this very significant Bill which has now become part of our law. Concerned Nigerians’ Adeyanju Lauds Buhari For Signing… New Electoral Act Will Deepen Nigeria’s Democracy –… “This Electoral law is quite significant in many ways. It will forever remove the democratic process from the shackles of godfatherism and money bags who continue to sabotage the will of the people,” he said. According to the PDP chieftain, the action taken by the President will equally reduce a great deal of electoral malpractices through the brazen  forging of figures and other manipulative processes that hinder the democratic growth. George said, “The Nigerian democracy is now on the path of liberation and emancipatory importance. The Will of the people will now triumph over the shenanigans of a dirty few. This,  no doubt , will deepen our democratic values and ensure the endurance of freedom and liberty.  It is indeed a right step in the right direction.” “Nigerians have suffered a lot for this democratic dawn.  We must all applaud every opportunity that enhances our collective freedom. The next agenda that needs the attention of President Buhari is the devolution of powers where all sections of our nation will be empowered to develop at its own pace without the overbearing intervention of the center,” he said.
