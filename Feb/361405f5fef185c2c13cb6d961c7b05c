ABUJA – An aspirant for the position of the national youth leader of the All Progressive Congress (APC), Barr. Maxwell Gowon has disassociated himself from comments credited to him in some sections of the media, that he faulted the Senator Abdullahi Adamu reconciliation committee’s report. Gowon, who is also the Chairman of Northern Aspirants Forum for the February 26 national convention of APC, stated on Sunday, in his reaction through a statement, that he knew nothing about the said media report, which carries a different name as Maxwell Yakubu Gowon.

Why would anyone ascribe such comments to me? I’m Barr. Maxwell Gowon and an aspirant for youth leader of our party, but I never mentioned it to anyone that the Senator Abdullahi Adamu report was faulty; and I stand to disassociate myself from such statement. “As for the Governor Mai Buni led CECPS, I have much respect for the committee and I’m in support of whatever decision the Committee takes, for the betterment of our party. “But I wish to state here categorically that, I was not a party to the statement that tried to discredit the Senator Abdullahi Adamu reconciliation committee report. I’m in full support of all the recommendations, especially, anything that would make peace to reign supreme in our party”, Barr. Gowon said on Sunday.
