AKURE – Ondo State government has declared that it would not approve any loan for any farm­er in the state as over N2billion loans accessed by farmers have not been redeemed. The state Commissioner for Agriculture, Aribo Olayato dis­closed this on Friday when on inspection visitation of Mitelo Integrated Farms, Ogbese, Ak­ure North Local Government Area of the state. He disclosed that a large number of farmers who ac­cessed the loans were yet to defray the loans.

Aribo, however, disclosed that the state government has another programme to support farmers including large scale farmers like Mitelo Farms. He said the government had designed a programme through it would partner with farmers who see farming as a business and would give tech­nical assistance and advice to them. The commissioner, there­fore, promised to discuss with Dr. (Mrs.) Funmilayo Wil­liams-Daudu, owner of the integrated farms on how the state government could part­ner with them. Dr. Williams-Daudu told newsmen that she invited the commissioner for assessment and to see how the farms could collaborate with the state gov­ernment to make life easy for the people on food production. POLL “We invited him because he’s a man of vision and the government is ready to support people who are already trying their best to make life easy for others,” Dr. Williams-Daudu said.
