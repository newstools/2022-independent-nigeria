Redeploys Yaya-Kolade To NSIWC ABUJA – President Muhammadu Buhari on Wednesday appointed Assistant Inspector General of Police (AIG) Olugbenga Adeyanju, and Yaya-Kolade as Commissioner of the Independent Corrupt Practices and other Related Offences Commission (ICPC) representing South-West; and Mojisola Yaya-Kolade as a Full-time Commissioner (compensation) in the National Salaries Income and Wages Commission in accordance with the provisions of Section 2 of the Act establishing the said Commission. In a letter dated 9th February 2022 to the President of the Senate, Ahmad Lawan, President Muhammadu Buhari requested that the Senate confirms AIG Adeyanju, (Rtd) from Ekiti State, in accordance with the provisions of Section 3 (3) (a) of the Corrupt Practices and Other Related Offences Act 2000 Cap. C31 Laws of the Federation 2004. Children As Young As Five Will Be Offered Covid Vaccine In… Biden Orders Release Of Trump White House Logs To Panel Probing… The law provides that “a retired police officer not below the rank of Commissioner of Police” must be part of the composition of the Anti Corruption Commission. AIG Adeyanju is to replace earlier nominated Dr (Mrs) Mojisola Yaya-Kolade. The President in a previous letter dated 14th September 2021, had requested the upper chamber to confirm Dr. Mojisola Yaya-Kolade alongside four others as Commissioners of the Independent Corrupt Practices and other Related Offences Commission (ICPC). However, the need to fully comply with the provisions of the extant Act has necessitated the substitution. Yaya-Kolade, an accomplished nurse, pharmacist and physician, was also former Ekiti State Commissioner for Health. Earlier she was screened by the Senate Committee on Anti-Corruption and Financial Crimes, however, the new letter from President Buhari makes her a Full-time Commissioner (compensation) in the National Salaries Income and Wages Commission.
