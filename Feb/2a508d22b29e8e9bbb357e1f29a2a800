Following the death of one of the students on Thursday evening, students of the Adekunle Ajasin University, Akungba (AAUA) have staged a peaceful protest against the incessant occurrence of accidents in the University community. According to reports, a collision between two trucks claimed the lives of three persons including a graduate of the institution who had come for his clearance in order to proceed with the mandatory one-year National Youth Service Corps programme. Enraged students of the institution blocked roads around the school and also burnt tyres to register their anger. The protesters gathered in front of the school gate, barricading the Owo-Ikare Akoko expressway, chanting various solidarity songs.
