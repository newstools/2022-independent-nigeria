He came in as a number-one driver of Nigeria’s biggest commercial and multi-billionaire infrastructural state, Lagos, with many unforeseen circumstances, nay Covid-19 pandemic, EndSARS riots, and other sundry issues which made him an incident commander and earned him many accolades and gratitude from many quarters and national institutions. Without being patronising, he stands tall to prove himself to be the acclaimed Commander of the State of Aquatic Splendour, Lagos, even in the face of the deadly virus that took the world by the jugular. The Governor never seems tired of the many challenges that confronted his early days in office. Though when he came in as the Governor of Lagos State, many were in doubt of his creative abilities and trailblazer. But he has proved many wrongs that he has all it takes to grandstand in many sectors: Education, Health, Empowerment, Security, Justice, and what have you. One year to his exit as his first term in office, Babajide Sanwo-Olu has done many things in his capacity as one that deserves a second term, despite speculations and brouhaha in his party; this humble and selfless servant of the people deserves all the accolades that come his way, for a job well done.
