ONITSHA – The fuel scarcity and incessant hike in prices of petroleum products in Nigeria have been described as a result of leadership failure and evidence that the country lacks patriotic political leaders. A social analyst and Coordinator, Campaign for Moral and Social Liberation of Nigerians (CAMSOLINA), Afam Chimezie told our correspondent in Onitsha yesterday that it was stupid and unthinkable for an oil producing country like Nigeria and her citizens to wallow in abject poverty and experience scarcity of products which the country produces. Ogbuefi Chimezie who lampooned the political leaders over their insincerity in the leadership of the country stated that corruption, diversion of public funds and property have become the order of the day among the nation’s political office holders.
