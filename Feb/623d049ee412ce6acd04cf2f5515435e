Karen James has said that women should come on board and join forces with her organisation to help reduce the level of corruption in the country.

She said,  “We love our husbands, our children and we love those who love God”, noting that youths deserve to be given a chance to rule between the ages of 30 and 60 and that any age above that was unacceptable.” 2023: Nobody Should Spoil Ubuluisiuzo, Osumoghu’s Chances… Borno Lawmaker Hails FG For Ongoing Reconstruction Of 127km… According to the Women Alliance president, Nigeria needs to be delivered from corruption and corrupt practices and it is only women in politics that can bring such deliverance and salvation to the country.
