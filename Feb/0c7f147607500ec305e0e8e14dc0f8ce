The striking lecturers had embarked on a four-week rollover total and comprehensive strike on February 14, to press home their demands. The lecturers’ agitations include funding for the revitalisation of public universities, earned academic allowances, University Transparency Accountability Solution and promotion arrears. Others are the renegotiation of 2009 ASUU-FGN agreement, and the inconsistencies in Integrated Personnel and Payroll Information System (IPPIS). The lecturers also alleged that none of their demands had been fully met by the Federal Government.
