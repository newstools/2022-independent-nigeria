Queen Elizabeth will miss a planned virtual engagement on Tuesday because she is still experiencing mild cold-like symptoms after testing positive for COVID-19, a spokesman for Buckingham Palace said. The palace announced that the Queen, 95, had tested positive on Sunday and would continue with light duties. Further engagements, such as her weekly conversation with Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Wednesday, will be decided upon nearer to the time.

Both her eldest son Prince Charles, 73, and daughter-in-law Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall, 74, have recently contracted COVID-19. Charles has since returned to work. Charles, the heir to the throne, earlier this month pulled out of an event after contracting coronavirus for a second time. A palace source said he had met the Queen just days before. Britain’s longest-reigning monarch, the Queen reached the milestone of 70 years on the throne on February 6, the anniversary of the death in 1952 of her father King George VI. She recently returned to public duties following several months off after she was told to rest by her doctors after spending a night in hospital for tests in October. POLL The Queen was forced to cancel appearances at several key events, including Remembrance Sunday services at the COP26 climate conference in Glasgow, Scotland. In the past week, she has held audiences both virtually and in person. During one exchange caught on camera last week, she walked slowly with a stick and said “as you can see, I can’t move” in an apparent reference to her leg. The Queen is the latest monarch from around the world to catch COVID-19. Queen Margrethe of Denmark, 82, and Spain’s King Felipe VI, 54, both tested positive for the virus in February and had mild symptoms.
