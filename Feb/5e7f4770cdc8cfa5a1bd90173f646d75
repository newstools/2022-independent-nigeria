His family were forced to flee from their home in Zadar at the start of the Croatian War of Independence in 1991, with his grandfather killed, and their family home destroyed. The horror of war meant Modric spent a large part his childhood living in a local hotel, before joining NK Zadar aged 11, and moving on to Dinamo Zagreb as a teenager.
