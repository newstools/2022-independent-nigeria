Liverpool looked right at their best in destroying Leeds 6-0 at Anfield on Wednesday night. Mohammed Salah scored two penalties in the first half and in between set up Josip Matip perfectly for a goal after the centre back’s buccaneering run forward. In truth, it could have been six in the first half with Luis Diaz particularly unlucky when a shot bound for the top corner was blocked by Sadio Mane. Zamfara Dep. Gov. Impeached, Gov.
