The International Labour Organization (ILO) is to host a high-level, multilateral, Global Forum for a Human-centred Recovery, aimed at increasing the level and coherence of the international response to the economic and social impact of the COVID-19 crisis. The virtual forum which will be held from 22-24 February will bring together Heads of State and Government, heads of international organizations and multilateral development banks, and employers’ and workers’ leaders from around the world. They will discuss concrete actions and strengthened institutional arrangements to enhance the international community’s response to the devastating effects of the pandemic on people and the widening inequalities among and within countries.

The participants will examine the actions and investments needed to support a fully inclusive, human-centred recovery from the crisis in all countries, through the expansion of decent jobs and inclusive economic growth, universal social protection, workers’ protections, enterprise sustainability, and a just transition towards a carbon-neutral global economy
