United are also being tipped to rival Liverpool for PSV Eindhoven winger Cody Gakpo. Liverpool have been heavily linked with the wide man, who has managed 12 assists in 18 league appearances so far this season. But The Mirror reports the Merseyside club are now set for a battle, with United also keeping taps on Gakpo ahead of this summer. The Red Devils may not end their hijack attempts at Gakpo, with West Brom keeper Sam Johnstone also being linked. United could allow Dean Henderson to leave this summer, with the goalkeeper likely to want to leave in the name of first team appearances. According to 90min, United are considering Johnstone as a replacement, and he could come for free with his current contract set to expire this summer. Johnstone, who is a United academy graduate, is also said to be of interest to Tottenham.
