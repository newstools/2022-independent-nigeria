LAGOS – Special Assistant to President Buhari on Digital and New Media, Tolu Ogunlesi has applauded the Governor of Borno State Prof. Babagana Umara Zulum, on the progress he has made in the state ever since he assumed office as Governor of the state. Ogunlesi who showered accolades on Zulum in a series of tweets on his official twitter handle @toluogunlesi stated that even with the debilitating challenges the state has encountered since 2011, appreciable progress has been made in all sectors of the state since the beginning of Zulum’s administration till date. He wrote, “Watched @ProfZulum speak at #StateHouseBriefing today. Very frank talk on the progress in Borno, and lingering challenges. Borno has really been very lucky with Governors, since 2011 at least. And even as challenges remain, a LOT of progress has been made under PMB.” APC: Zulum Visits Hometown Mafa For Ward Congresses “You cannot appreciate just how much things have changed for the better in Borno without considering what things used to look like, 2014/2015: Schools shut, airport closed, major roads closed, Maiduguri permanently under siege, LGAs under insurgent control, suicide bombings, etc.” “Gov Zulum did a great job sketching out just how much has improved: major roads reopened, suicide bombings tamed, no LGA controlled/occupied by insurgents, surge in return to farms, surge in return to previously-sacked communities, tens of thousands of homes rebuilt.” “He was also very frank about the continuing challenges: ISWAP continues to be a problem esp on the fringes of Lake Chad (and they’re a bigger headache than BH, he says); IDP camps have become havens of prostitution, drugs, gangs; food security still a major issue, etc.” See tweet below; POLL
