The Southern and Middle Belt Alliance (SaMBA) has applauded the decision by the All Progressives Congress (APC) to zone the presidency to the south, ahead of the 2023 general elections, asking the leading opposition party, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), to copy suit. The group, in a statement signed by its spokesman, Prince Rwang Pam Jnr, asked the main opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) to quit prevaricating and make a categorical statement zoning the presidency to the south immediately. SaMBA emphasized that zoning the presidency to the south is the only way to foster a more united Nigeria and demonstrates that Nigeria is a country that values fairness, justice, and equity as enshrined in the 1999 Constitution as amended. APC Now Adrift, Party Faction, Stakeholders In Kwara Say After… Insecurity: Former Aviation Minister, Fani-Kayode  Advocates… By zoning the office of president to the South, APC has proved its commitment to the unity of Nigeria, an example that every party that is interested in contesting the 2023 presidential election should emulate. “The decision by the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) to zone the presidency to the southern part of Nigeria is a step in the right direction and every party interested in contesting the presidential election in 2023 should toe the path of the ruling APC to concede the slot to the south. “The main opposition party, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) must not allow lethargy and prevarication to hamper its 2023 presidential ambitions. “As we have previously stated, the rotational presidency will help foster equity, fairness and justice as enshrined in the 1999 constitution as amended. “It is in the best interest of not only the PDP but every other political party in Nigeria to follow the example of the APC on zoning. POLL “We, therefore, commend the ruling APC for zoning the presidency to the south ahead of the 2023 general elections.”
