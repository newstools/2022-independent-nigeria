President Muhammadu Buhari on Thursday in Lafia, Nasarawa State capital, said leaders who take the oath of office, swearing with the Holy Book, must be careful not to abuse the trust of leadership placed on them by the people and God. Speaking at a courtesy visit to the palace of Emir of Lafia, retired Justice Sidi Bage Muhammad I, the President reaffirmed that he has no intention whatsoever to stay beyond the constitutionally recognised two terms of office as leader of Nigeria. ”The traditional ruler is on a terminal appointment. Constitutionally, we (elected public office holders) are not. I cannot go beyond two terms and I have sworn by the Holy Quran that I will uphold the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria.” Buhari Swears In 6 INEC Commissioners Electoral Act: Buhari Won’t Remain In Office Beyond 2023,… ”Politics apart, whenever we are made to swear by the Holy Quran, we have to be very careful.
