Rasaq Salinsile at Osun Police Command headquarters in Osogbo on Wednesday said “We found your Command’s position on the attack on the Minister for Interior, Ogbeni Rauf Aregbesola contained in the press release of February 15, 2022 absurd, disturbing and unbelievable. “As bonafide citizens of Nigeria and the socio-political environment called the State of Osun, we put on record once more that you are incapable of living up to the billings of your core duty as protector of lives and property of all citizens. “It is sad that your Command has taken its bias tendencies to the highest level of calling the Minister of the Federal Republic of Nigeria a criminal. “It is heart wrenching that your Command has caved in totally to the lucre-based influence of Governor Gboyega Oyetola and shown unbridled loyalty to him by castigating the minister by the content of your press release. “It is a sad tale that your Command, without any of your men in the Minister’s convoy, as it pleases your master at Okefia Government House, concluded that “Minister brought in hoodlums to disturb the peace of the state. “It is most sour that in your bid to play his master’s voice, your Command alleged criminality against the Minister who served as Governor for two terms of eight years in this state and without many criminal incidents as it is rampant now.”
