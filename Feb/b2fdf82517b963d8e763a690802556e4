Rafa Benitez Sounds Inter Milan Warning To Liverpool Ahead Of… AFCON: Salah To Return To Liverpool Training On Tuesday Three days ago, we covered claims made La Repubblica that stated the Merseyside club are among the sides who are ‘ready to move’ for the Ivory Coast international. Tuttosport on Thursday explain that even though Juventus and Inter Milan in the mix for the player, his main suitors are from abroad. Jürgen Klopp’s side are first to be named and it’s claimed they have been ‘very close’ to Kessié. However, the ex-Atalanta man seems not to be their main target for midfield.

That’s the only information Tuttosport mention about the Ligue 1 man and Liverpool’s interest in him. It’ll be interesting to see whether these claims will be backed up by the media in England and/or France.
