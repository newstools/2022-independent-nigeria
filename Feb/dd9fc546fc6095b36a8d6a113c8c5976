Lagos – Barely one week after domestic airline operators decried the sharp increase in the price of Jet-A1, otherwise known as aviation fuel, from N190 a year ago to N400, Daily Independent can report that the price of the product has once again climbed. This is as operating airlines in the country have also met to fix the minimum airfare base for one-way flight to N50, 000. A source close to one of the operators told Daily Independent that the price of aviation fuel has increased to N420 per litre on Sunday as against N400 on Thursday. The source, however, said that the price of the product oscillates between N430 and N450 in some northern states.

The source said: “As at today (Sunday), a litre of fuel goes for N420 in Lagos and it is between N430 and N450 in some northern states. The fact is that the price of the product may go higher as aviation fuel is scarce in the country. “About three weeks ago, the product was scarce in all the airports in the country and this contributed to some of the delayed flights we experienced at that period. The government needs to arrest the situation before it goes out of hand.” Aviation fuel takes between 35 and 40 percent of the total economics of airlines and some of the stakeholders are concerned that some of the operators may be compelled to shut operations if the challenges in the sub-sector were not immediately nipped in the bud by the government. Another source told Daily Independent that the current economic situation in the country was responsible for the rise in airfares. According to the source, in the last few months, the handling rates by the ground handling companies had increased, while the infrastructure at all the airports have continued to deteriorate at an alarming rate. POLL He said: “‘Ground handling fees have increased, fueling has increased, yet, we don’t have forex to do our business. “Also, you can take a look at the infrastructure we have at our airports, which one of them is working optimally? We don’t have support from the government and they want same low fares? Airlines only reacted to the prevailing economic situation and the complaint should go the right quarters.’” Just about two weeks ago, Dr. Obiora Okonkwo, the Chairman, United Nigeria Airlines (UNA), had raised the alarm that the price of aviation fuel rose by over 100 percent in the last one year. Besides, Okonkwo stated that the exchange rate had also jumped from N340 to N570 to a dollar within the same period, stressing that it was pertinent for the government to look critically into the development of the industry in order to arrest collapse. “The aviation industry in Nigeria has witnessed a whole lot of inconsistencies in the last one year. For instance, when we started on February 12, 2021, the price of aviation fuel was only N190 per litre, but today, the same product goes for N400 per litre. ] “Also, the first foreign exchange we had about a year ago was N340 to a dollar, but today, it is between N450 and N570, especially if you are sourcing from the other market”, he had said. Also, Barr. Allen Onyema, the Chairman, Air Peace, had told Daily Independent that aviation fuel price gallops between N400 and N500 at present in some airports.
