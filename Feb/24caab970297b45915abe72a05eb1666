FIFA and UEFA have officially announced that Russian clubs and the national team have been suspended from their competitions. The news comes following talks between the Bureau of the FIFA Council and the Executive Committee of UEFA, with many fans and pundits previously expressing anger at the initial measures. Sanctions are being laid against Russia following their recent invasion of Ukraine. The reason for the decision can be found in the statement, where they note that “football is fully united here and in full solidarity with all the people affected in Ukraine. Both Presidents hope that the situation in Ukraine will improve significantly and rapidly so that football can again be a vector for unity and peace amongst people.” FIFA In ‘Advanced Discussions’ To Expel Russia From… FIFA Backs Semi-Automated Offside System To Boost VAR The announcement means that Spartak Moscow will be forced to drop out of the Europa League and the Russian national team will no longer be competing in the upcoming 2022 World Cup play-offs. Things were initially kicked off by the Polish FA last week after they refused to play Russia in the play-off tie. Sweden and the Czech Republic, the other two teams in that play-off bracket, followed the Polish decision, putting significant pressure on FIFA. UEFA have already changed the location of the Champions League final, which was originally due to be held in St Petersburg before UEFA instead moved it to Paris.
