Bismarck, who enumerated the current state of the Nigerian economy, noted that Nigeria’s expenditure currently stands at N19.63 trillion while its revenue stands at N10.71 trillion. This, he said, represented a fiscal deficit of N8.92 trillion, which translates to an increasing level of poverty, inflation, unemployment and the number of out-of-school children. POLL He noted that the number of fully employed Nigerians had dipped by 54.41 per cent in the last five years and the working population grew by 18.45 per cent, while 50 per cent of Nigerians remain idle.
