President of Guinea-Bissau Umaro Sissoco Embalo called for calm today following an attempted coup on Tuesday. He insisted that the situation was under control as he addressed the nation on television and said that unidentified armed assailants had attacked the government building in the capital Bissau when he was attending a cabinet meeting. “It wasn’t just a coup,” Mr. Embalo said. “It was an attempt to kill the president, the prime minister, and the entire cabinet.” Casualties confirmed As Turkey Targets PKK In Iraq, Syria Boris Johnson Refuses To Withdraw Conspiracy Theory, Jimmy… Security forces eventually repelled the attack but lost “many members” during a gun battle, which he said lasted for hours. The president slammed the operation as “a failed attack against democracy,” saying it had been “well prepared and organized.” Mr. Embalo sought to dispel rumors earlier in the day that government officials were being held hostage and he said that a number of those involved in the putsch had been arrested. The country’s armed forces were not involved in the plot, he added. “I can assure you that no camp joined this attempted coup. It was isolated. It is linked to people we have fought against,” Mr. Embalo said without giving further details.
