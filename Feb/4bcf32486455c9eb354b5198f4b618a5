AWKA – The Commissioner of Police, Anambra State Police Command, Echeng Echeng, has said that the police should not be blamed for the fatal accident that claimed two lives and left several others injured at Ihi­ala, Ihiala local government area of the state on February 18, 2022. Echeng, who made his position known through a statement issued by the Police Public Relations Of­ficer, Ikenga Tochukwu, a Deputy Superintendent of Police (DSP) on Saturday, explained that stop and search were critical assignments of the police to guarantee public safety and that the miniature traf­fic caused during stop and search could not have been responsible for a fatal crash. The police commissioner, who sent his condolences to the fami­lies of the deceased accident vic­tims as well as prayed for the quick recovery of the injured ones, also appealed to the motoring public in Anambra State, especially the union of trailer drivers, to unblock the federal highway at Ihiala to al­low stranded travellers continue their journey to their respective des­tinations as blocking the road would only create a chaotic situation.
