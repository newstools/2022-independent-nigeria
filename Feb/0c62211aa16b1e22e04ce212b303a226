Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang’s move to Barcelona is seemingly imminent after the striker was allowed to leave former club Arsenal on a free transfer on Monday. And, according to reports, the Gunners paid the Gabonese international to rip up his contract – with a £7million fee being touted as the sum it cost to release him. Aubameyang, 32, joined Arsenal four years ago from Borussia Dortmund in a deal worth around £60m. He shone at the Emirates for the majority of his stint, scoring 54 league goals in his first 85 games as the Gunners continued to cement their place in European competition.

But from here his output went downhill with just 14 goals in 43 league matches, which was not enough to save the club from failing to qualify for Europe for the first time in 27 years. After being stripped of the captaincy in December for a spate of disciplinary issues, Arsenal felt it was best to release their man, which despite saving them £27m in wages, reportedly cost them an eye-watering £7m upfront.
