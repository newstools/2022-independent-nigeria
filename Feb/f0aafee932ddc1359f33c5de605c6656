EU foreign ministers on Monday green-lit emergency financial assistance of €1.2 billion to Ukraine in the form of loans. Ministers in Brussels gave final approval to the aid package to provide rapid support to Ukraine, which is losing access to international capital markets due to the impact of the ongoing crisis on its economic situation. The financial assistance will have a duration of 12 months, with a first tranche of €600 million to be handed out “swiftly.” The second disbursement will be linked to some conditions and policy reforms in areas such as economic resilience, rule of law and energy.

In a Council of the EU statement, French Minister for Economy Bruno Le Maire said: “The EU has acted swiftly and decisively to help Ukraine. Within 21 days, we completed the necessary work, which means that €1.2 billion macro-financial assistance can now reach Ukraine.”
