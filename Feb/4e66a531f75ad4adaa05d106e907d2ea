Manchester United have reportedly agreed a deal to sell Andreas Pereira to Flamengo for £12million. The midfielder has been on loan at the Brazilian club since last August, making 25 appearances and scoring five goals. He is now set to permanently depart Old Trafford, calling an end to an 11-year spell with the Red Devils.

Flamengo have been keen to secure the permanent signing of the 26-year-old despite his error in November’s Copa Libertadores final costing them the trophy against Palmeiras. Pereira’s heavy touch in extra-time of the showpiece game allowed Deyverson to snatch possession and slot the ball past Diego Alves, making it 2-1. Having joined United at the age of 15, Pereira made his senior debut in the humiliating 4-0 defeat to MK Dons in the League Cup in August 2014. After loan spells in La Liga with Granada and Valencia, it was not until the 2018-19 campaign where he became a more regular fixture at Old Trafford. POLL Pereira won the club’s goal of the season award that year for his sensational effort from outside of the box against Southampton. In total, the one-cap Brazilian international made 75 appearances for United in all competitions – the last of which came in August 2020.
