He encouraged Nigerians, particularly INL staff to be of good cheer for a better tomorrow, as he said there was no best time to appreciate God than when there seemed to be delay in answers to prayers, stressing that God can be trusted. Meanwhile, Tope Glory Music Gospel Band would be leading participants in worship and praise sessions, while members of management staff would also lead sessions of prayer, added Adebisi.
