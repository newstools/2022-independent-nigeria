The Naif Police Station, in cooperation with the General Department of Transport & Rescue and the General Directorate of Civil Defence in Dubai, has recently rescued an African young man who got trapped inside a billboard of a retail store. Colonel Omar Musa Ashour, Deputy Director of Naif Police Station, said S.D, an African national, had a dispute with his flatmates before leaving the room in anger and going to the bathroom. “Filled with anger, the 19-year-old young man decided to get out of the bathroom window of the first-floor flat,” “He managed to squeeze his body out of the window, but he lost control and fell inside a billboard of a shop on the ground floor,” Col. Ashour said. Col. Ashour said the shop owner saw the young man trapped in the billboard, so he immediately called the Dubai Police Command and Control Centre. “Upon receiving the emergency call, rescue teams were dispatched to the incident scene and worked professionally to free the young man and transfer him to a hospital for necessary treatment,” Col Ashour concluded.
