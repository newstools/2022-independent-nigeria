To reach the semis, Burkina Faso beat Tunisia 1-0 in their quarter-final, while Senegal beat Equa­torial Guinea 3-1.

Eguavoen Submits AFCON 2021 Technical Report Domestic Leagues To Kick Off Soon –NBBF Burkina Faso is adept at frustrating their oppo­nents, and it’s this tactic that has predominantly seen them make the last four. They might not have enough to win, but Burki­na Faso have the organisa­tion and quiet confidence to make life difficult for Senegal. But against Sadio Mane led Teranga Lions, who turned their stride on at the business end of the tournament, Burkina Faso goal will be to reach the fi­nal and surpass their 2013 run, where they lost 1-0 to Nigeria. But failing to beat Sen­egal in their last four meetings since 2006, with their most recent three en­counters ending in draws makes this tie a very tricky one. With two goals at the tournament so far, Mane has played a crucial role for Senegal, and all eyes will be on him again here. Watford’s Ismaila Sarr and Crystal Palace’s Cheikhou Kouyate were both on tar­get for Senegal in their 3-1 quarter-final win over Equatorial Guinea. For Burkina Faso, Ber­trand Traore sat out the last game with a muscle strain and isn’t certain to start. He has got on the scoresheet once at the finals so far.
