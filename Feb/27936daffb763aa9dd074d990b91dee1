ABUJA: Nigerians have been asked to disregard an alleged smear campaign planned to disparage the Minister of Niger Delta Affairs, Senator Godswill Akpabio. A group, Godswill Akpabio For Common Good (GACG), raised the alarm in a press statement issued by the National Coordinator of the group, Jibril Tafida in Abuja. Describing the purported campaign as the handiwork of mischievous persons, the group said that “the attention of the Godswill Akpabio For Common Good (GACG) Media Office, has once again, been drawn to plans by some faceless politicians to instigate public protests, publication of falsehood and campaign of calumny against the person and office of the Hon Minister Niger Delta Affairs.

The kick-off date for the planned campaign of calumny against the Hon Minister is March 1, 2022.”
