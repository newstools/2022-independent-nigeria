The management of Maritime Academy of Nigeria (MAN), Oron, Akwa Ibom State, has identified absence from revision classes as major reason for the mass failure recorded in the Certificate of Competency (COC), examinations conducted by Nigerian Maritime Administration and Safety Agency (NIMASA), at the institution in 2021. Rector of the academy, Commodore Duja Effedua (Rtd) in a statement, said that while the assertions of the Director General of NIMASA, Dr. Bashir Jamoh was correct on the poor performances, he however, stated that it was an issue that goes beneath the surface. He also said some of the candidates never registered for formal training in navigation under appropriate academies before coming forward to sit for the CoC examination.

He explained further that there was nothing new that the trained candidates needed to be taught, as they have already been trained at various institutions, including the Academy before coming to write the COC Examinations. The Rector said: “It would be recalled that in 2018 and 2019, I warned that the trend would continue unless certain issues were addressed. My personal observation is that these candidates hardly attend classes. “Candidates register for the examination but only about 30% of the registered candidates end up attending all the classes. It is pertinent to note that these classes are Revision Classes and not training as misconstrued in many quarters. “There is nothing new that these candidates need to be taught as they have already been trained at various institutions including the Academy before coming to the Academy to write the Examinations.”
