A South African court has dismissed former President Jacob Zuma’s attempt to remove the prosecutor from his upcoming corruption trial. Zuma’s effort to have the prosecutor taken off his corruption case was rejected Wednesday by Pietermaritzburg High Court Judge Piet Koen, on the grounds that it “lacks reasonable prospects of success.” Zuma, South Africa’s president from 2009 to 2018 before he was ousted by his African National Congress party amid wide-ranging allegations of corruption, had argued that lead prosecutor Billy Downer is biased against him. His lawyers accused Downer of leaking confidential information about his case to the media and being a witness in a separate case against him by the opposition party, the Democratic Alliance.
