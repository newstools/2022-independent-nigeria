Lloyd described silence by Shell Petroleum Development Company (SPDC), and other multinationals over the ongoing war against illegal oil bunkering activities in Rivers State as a direct indictment on the companies. “Till now, nothing has been heard of SPDC and other multinationals regarding this illegal oil bunkering activities.
