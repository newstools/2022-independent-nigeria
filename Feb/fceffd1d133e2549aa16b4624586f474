The Premier League are aiming to remove all of their COVID-19 emergency measures later this month. There have been strict rules at stadiums and training grounds since the return to action following the initial UK lockdown. These rules, introduced for ‘Project Restart’ in mid-2020, include regular testing, coloured zones, the use of PPE and restrictions on media activities.

Prime minister Boris Johnson announced earlier this week, however, that the plan is for the UK to end all COVID-19 restrictions, including self-isolation for a positive test, by the end of February. And the Premier League have now rowed back on their own rules, and suggested they will all be removed by the end of this month. A statement said: “At today’s Premier League Shareholders’ meeting, it was decided to remove a number of the COVID-19 Emergency Measures from Friday, 11 February. “While the requirement to ensure social distancing indoors is maintained, restrictions such as wearing face coverings in indoor areas and limiting treatment time will be removed. Lateral flow testing for players and relevant club staff will revert to twice weekly from Monday, 14 February. POLL “The Premier League’s COVID-19 Emergency Measures remain under regular review, with the aim of them expiring at the end of this month.”
