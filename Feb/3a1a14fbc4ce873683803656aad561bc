GOMBE – The exit from the Gombe State chapter of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) by one of its stalwarts, Dr Jamilu Isyaku Gwamna, is eliciting applause and excitement from his supporters. Many of them had earlier been appealing to him to leave the APC because they allege that they will not get justice from the APC party, especially as The Governor had pocketed all the executive members in the entire State. Dr Jamilu, a former Governorship aspirant in PDP before the 2019 general election, who dumped the PDP after the primaries with thousands of his supporters, says his sojourn in the APC has come to an end.
