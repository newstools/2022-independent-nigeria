LAGOS  – Nigeria’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) grew 4.0% y/y in the fourth quarter of last year despite the emergence of new variants of the pandemic and uptick in case count on account of the non-oil sector segment which expanded 4.4% y/y in FY:2021 (Q1: 0.8%, Q2: 6.7%, Q3: 5.4%, and Q4: 4.7%) respectively, analyst have said. They implored the Federal Government to fast track the implementation of policies to diversify its export potentials, mostly the huge stock of natural and agro resources. They added that the modest fourth quarter Gross Domestic Product growth rate was largely galvanised by the services sector with an average growth of 5.6% y/y and the agriculture sector at 2.1% y/y.

According to the NBS, Nigeria’s GDP grew 4.0% y/y in Q4:2021 despite the emergence of new variants of the pandemic and uptick in case count. The Q4 growth brought the full-year rate to 3.4% y/y , exceeding the expectations of the IMF (3.0%), World Bank (2.4%) and Afrinvest (3.0%). POLL The modest GDP growth was driven by the non-oil segment, which expanded 4.4% y/y in FY:2021 (Q1: 0.8%, Q2: 6.7%, Q3: 5.4%, and Q4: 4.7%). The oil segment extended its lacklustre performance to 7 successive quarters in Q4 (down 8.1%) culminating in an 8.3% y/y contraction in FY:2021, albeit lower than the level recorded in 2020 due to improved oil prices (averaging $70.95/bbl. vs $43.51/bbl. in 2020). Oil GDP contribution dropped to 7.2% (2020: 8.2%),while the non-oil contribution rose marginally to 92.8% (2020: 91.8%). Besides,14 activity sectors recorded positive growth in 2021 relative to 6 activity sectors in the pandemic-ravaged year 2020. While the non-oil segment’s performance gives some credence to FG’s diversification efforts, a delve into the three broad components showed that divergence lingers. The services component expanded the most, recording a 5.6% y/y growth in 2021 (2020: -2.2%). This was driven by full year expansion in Financial Institutions and Insurance (+10.1% y/y), Trade (+8.6% y/y), and telecommunications & information services (+7.3% y/y). The agriculture sector grew 2.1% y/y (2020: 2.2%), supported mainly by crop contrast, the Industries sector contractproduction which expanded 2.3% y/y. In ed mildly by 0.5% y/y; indicating a 5.4% improvement relative to the contraction of 5.9% in 2020.

On a quarter-on-quarter basis, the real GDP grew at 9.63% in Q4 2021 compared to Q3 2021, reflecting a higher economic activity than the preceding quarter. Meanwhile, the real growth of the oil sector was –8.06% (year-on-year) in Q4 2021 indicating an increase by 11.71% points relative to rate recorded in the corresponding quarter of 2020. Growth increased by 2.68% points when compared to Q3 2021 which was –10.73%. Nigeria recorded an average daily oil production of 1.50 million barrels per day (mbpd) in Q4 2021, lower than the daily average production of 1.56 mbpd recorded in the same quarter of 2020 by 0.06 mbpd and lower than the third quarter 2021 production volume of 1.57 mbpd On the other hand, the non-oil sector grew by 4.73% in real terms during the reference quarter (Q4 2021). This rate was higher by 3.05% point compared to the rate recorded same quarter of 2020 and 0.71% point lower than the third quarter of 2021. This sector was driven in the fourth quarter of 2021 mainly by Agriculture (crop production); trade; Information and Communication (Telecommunication); and Financial and Insurance (Financial Institutions), accounting for positive GDP growth. In real terms, the Non-Oil sector contributed 94.81% to the nation’s GDP in fourth quarter 2021, higher from share recorded in the fourth quarter of 2020 which was 94.13% and higher than the third quarter of 2021 recorded as 92.51%. The annual contribution in 2021 was 92.76% The CPI data revealed that headline inflation rate moderated 3bps to 15.60% y/y in January 2022 (December 2021: 15.63% y/y), supported by a 24bps y/y decline in Food inflation to 17.1% y/y while core inflation rate was unchanged at 13.9% y/y. On a month-on-month basis, the headline inflation rate decelerated 34bps to 1.5% (December 2021: 1.8%), supported by the decline in food inflation rate to 1.6%. Although food inflation rate moderated, the index reading above 1.0% m/m suggested sustained pressure on food prices. Dr Muda Yusuf, Chief Executive Officer of the Centre For Promotion of Private Enterprise (CPPE), in chats with Daily Independent on the Nigeria’s GDP grew 4.0% y/y in Q4:2021 despite the emergence of new variants of the pandemic, said the modest GDP growth was driven by the non-oil segment. He noted that while the non-oil segment’s performance gives some credence to Federal Government’s diversification efforts, a delve into the three broad components showed that divergence lingers. He said that rising inflation in Nigeria has resulted in the escalation of production and operating costs for businesses, leading to erosion of profit margins, drop in sales, decline in turnover and weak manufacturing capacity utilisation, high food prices which impacts adversely on citizens welfare and aggravates poverty. He said that it has also lead to weak purchasing power in the hands of Nigerians which has implications for aggregate demand and price volatility which undermines investors’ confidence. Yusuf said the drivers of inflation in Nigeria are exchange rate depreciation which has a significant impact on headline inflation, especially the core sub index; liquidity challenges in the foreign exchange market affecting access to manufacturing and other inputs; security concerns disrupting agricultural activities; climate change effects on agricultural production; structural constraints affecting productivity in the agricultural value chain; high transportation costs affecting distribution costs across the country. This is also reflected in the huge differential between farm gate prices and market prices. Others, according to him,include high and increasing energy cost; monetisation of fiscal deficit (CBN financing of deficit) is highly inflationary because of the liquidity injection effects on the economy; high transactions costs at the nations ports increases production and operating costs of businesses; high import duty on intermediate goods and raw materials; aggressive revenue drive by government agencies, taking a toll on cost of production. He said: “To curb the current inflationary pressure, government need to fix the following: address the security concerns causing disruption to agricultural activities. reform the foreign exchange market to stabilise the exchange rate, reduce volatility and stimulate foreign exchange inflows; address foreign exchange liquidity issues through appropriate policy measures; address the challenge of high transportation and logistics cost; reduce fiscal deficit monetisation to minimise incidence of high-powered money in the economy; manage climate change consequences to reduce flooding and desertification”. He also suggested that government should ensure the restoration of normalcy and good order at the nation’s ports to reduce transaction costs; reduce import duty on intermediate products and raw materials for industries to reduce production costs, especially in the light of the sharp depreciation in the exchange rate; address concerns around high energy cost and create an investment friendly tax environment. Friday Udoh, Director of Emerging Knowledge, Policy and Partnership, Institute of Professional Economists and Public Policy Management, said from the NBS report, the Q4 2021 growth rate was higher than the 0.11% growth rate recorded in Q4 2020 by 3.87% points and lower than 4.03% recorded in Q3 2021 by 0.05% points as a result of the relative growth in the non-oil sector. Udoh, called on the Federal Government to initiate reform policies that would solve structural constraints affecting productivity in the agricultural value chain. He said: “ Our call is necessary because, in real terms, the non-oil sector contributed 94.81% to the nation’s GDP in fourth quarter 2021, higher from share recorded in the fourth quarter of 2020 which was 94.13% and higher than the third quarter of 2021 recorded as 92.51%. The annual contribution in 2021 was 92.76%” Oyinkan Olasanoye, the National President, Association of Senior Staff of Banks, Insurance and other Financial Institutions (ASSBIFI), told our correspondent in a telephone conversation that the drivers of inflation in Nigeria are exchange rate depreciation which has a significant impact on headline inflation, especially the core sub index; liquidity challenges in the forex market affecting access to manufacturing and other inputs; security concerns disrupting agricultural activities; climate change effects on agricultural production; structural constraints affecting productivity in the agricultural value chain; high transportation costs affecting distribution costs across the country. She said: “Nigeria’s production networks will play a critical role in producing and distributing the goods and services that would reshape the economy when government policies addresses the challenges affecting the non-oil sectors of the economy” Afrinvest analysts, in their weekly report on Nigeria’s 2021 Gross Domestic Product (GDP) data and the January 2022 CPI report released by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS), stated that while the non-oil segment’s performance gives some credence to Federal Government ’s diversification efforts. “We link the decline in Agriculture sector growth and mild contraction of the Industries sector to the persistent insecurity and structural challenges prevailing in the economy. “For the oil sector, the technical and operational issues affecting the nation’s key oil production facilities constrained output as average oil production plunged further to 1.50mbpd in Q4:2021, relative to OPEC assigned quota of 1.68mbpd and 2021 budget benchmark of 1.86mbpd. “This implies that Nigeria missed out largely on the gains that should have accrued as a result of the rally in the global crude oil prices in 2021; evidenced in the 46.5% underperformance of the actual oil & gas revenue (N1.1tn) from January to November 2021. Although crude oil production is likely to remain constrained in 2022 (due to technical issues at major terminals, vandalism risk, and delay in PIA implementation), we maintain our base case growth projection of 2.9% (best case: 3.5%) for 2022 as highlighted in our 2022 Outlook report – “A Mix of Boom & Gloom.”
