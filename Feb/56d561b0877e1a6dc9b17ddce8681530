ABAKALIKI  – Worried by the increasing rate of youth restiveness and crim­inality, the people of Afikpo Community in Ebonyi State under the auspices of the Ehugbo General Assembly have enacted traditional laws aimed at checkmating the scourge. The community elders in a meeting at their traditional square Wednesday observed with shock, the frequent and indiscriminate use of ques­tionable handbags which the youths sling over their shoul­ders, noting with dismay that such bags, most times, are used to conceal dangerous weapons and hard drugs. After critical review of the use of these questionable handbags, the elders in a com­muniqué resolved to ban such usage just as culprits shall be sanctioned accordingly.

Another resolve taken by the elders was the total con­demnation of cult activities and senseless killings stress­ing that such dastardly acts shall be tackled severely by seriously sanctioning of de­faulters. Reacting to the issue, the Okabue of the Elders Council in Afikpo, Chief Christopher Abagha Egwu said the di­rectives, as issued, would be implemented to the letter as adequate measures had been streamlined to ensure full com­pliance. He said that the traditional town announcers have already circulated the decision of the assembly to all nooks and crannies of the various com­munities to that effect.
