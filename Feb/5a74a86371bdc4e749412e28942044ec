Ladipo said. Speaking further on efforts of the state government on eradication of malaria in the state Dr Ladipo said, Oyo State with some partner agencies sometimes last year distributed up to five million mosquitoes net to all local government areas across the state and that shows the importance that malaria seems to be in the anal of the state administration, more importantly apart from the distribution of the net other issues pertaining malaria intervention processes are also ongoing to ensure that malaria does not remain a burden to the people of the state, as we speak Oyo State is virtually second to none in the south West and perhaps one of the best state leading the train on malaria intervention in the country. “Record has it that in Oyo State malaria is no longer the lead cause of death in the children under the age of 5, it has been overtaken by diseases like cases of pneumonia and others and that tells you the fact that those processes that have been put together by malaria have been working but that doesn’t say that other areas should not look into and for that this is part of the reason why we are having this two days retreat and there are various partners, agencies of government, the UN and other organizations, with this current development I think we should be able to find a way forward the next one year or more for the health care system in Oyo State,” Ladipo stressed. One of the participants, Dr Ayandipo Oluwayemisi the state coordinator for the U.S. President’s for Malaria Initiative Program (PMI-S) said we are happy to support this two days retreat because we all know the importance of eliminating or eradicating malaria in our society and also improving the health system of the state. POLL She further said, “We really appreciate the Commissioner of health, he has been fully supportive of this program and at the end of the program we hope that all the executive present would have been oriented on the aspect of malaria, at the end of the day they would be able to provide the necessary and needed support to eradicate malaria at all levels and we would have a better system because we would have deliberated on the challenges, the gaps affecting our health system and proposed solutions which the Commissioner who is ready to take them home and ensure that they are fully implemented, the retreat is definitely going to have a positive impact on the grassroots people.”
