Na’Allah said: “Peculiarity of the universities in Nigeria is clear and does not have enough IGR to remit to the consolidated revenue fund as adduced by the auditor-general. “The universities collect only third party revenues from students. “Revenue collected are for specific purpose such as union dues, ID card, medical fees, laboratory fees usually refers to other charges. “Cost recovery concept is adopted by the university. “For instance, ID card charges were used to process ID cards for students. These revenues are not enough for the purpose collected and therefore the capacity for the university to remit surplus is lacking.” But Senator Urhoghide represented by the Vice Chairman of the Committee, Senator Ibrahim Hadejia, demanded for the refund of N603 million to the CRF.
