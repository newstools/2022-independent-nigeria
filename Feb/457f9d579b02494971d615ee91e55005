Provisional winners of the 3.5 Gigahertz (GHz) spectrum licence, MTN Communications Nigeria Plc and Mafab Communications Limited, have made their full payment of $273.6 million each for the 5G spectrum licence to the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC). The Executive Vice Chairman of NCC, Prof. Umar Danbatta, officially confirmed the payment status on Thursday, just as the deadline set for the two winners of the spectrum auction elapsed. As part of the auction process emplaced by the commission in the Information Memorandum (IM), three companies, namely MTN Nigeria, Mafab Communications Ltd and Airtel Networks Ltd submitted bids with an initial bid deposit (IBD) of $19.74 million, representing 10 percent of the reserve price of the 3.5GHz spectrum by the close of the bid submission date of November 29, 2021.

However, aside the $273.6 million payment, MTN paid additional $15.9 million, being the bidding sum it offered at the assignment state of the spectrum auction, making it clinch its preferred Lot 1 (3500-3600 Megahertz-MHz) in the 3.5Ghz spectrum; while Mafab Communications, which bided lower at the assignment stage, consequentially settled with Lot 2 (3700-3800Mhz) at no extra cost. Confirming the payments by the two licensees, Danbatta said: “I wish to officially announce that NCC has received and confirmed payments from MTN and Mafab for their acquisition of 1 slot of 100Mhz each in the 3.5Ghz spectrum auction, which was successfully conducted by the commission on December 13, 2021. They both met the deadline of February 24, 2022 as set by the commission. “Arising from this and on behalf of the Honourable Minister of Communications and Digital Economy, the board and management of the NCC, I wish to congratulate the MTN and Mafab for this feat, as we look forward to accomplishing other deployment timelines in the 5G deployment roadmap, as articulated in the National Policy on 5G Networks for Nigeria’s Digital Economy”. For meeting the payment deadline, Danbatta has commended the two companies for their commitment to 5G deployment drive through their private investments, which, he said, was a demonstration of the licensees’ belief in the sound regulatory environment in the Nigerian telecommunications sector. Danbatta also expressed appreciation to the Federal Government for its support and commitment to the deployment of 5G technology in Nigeria which, he said, will bring substantial network improvements, including higher connection speed, mobility and capacity, as well as low-latency capabilities to communications services in Nigeria. The commission published a public notice on its decision to award two lots of 100MHz Time Division Duplex (TDD) available in the 3.5 GHz band through an auction process, to support the delivery of ubiquitous broadband services for the deployment of 5G technology in Nigeria. Subsequently, an Information Memorandum (IM) was issued on November 10, 2021, in which bid applications for the available spectrum lots were invited. By the deadline for receipt of applications on November 29, 2021, the commission received applications from three licensed telecommunications companies, namely: Airtel Networks Limited, Mafab Communications Limited, and MTN Communications Nigeria Plc. POLL The auction held successfully on Monday, December 13, 2021 at the Transcorp Hilton Hotel, Abuja with the three bidders competing for the available two lots in which the commission adopted the ascending clock auction format that ended after Round 11, and proceeded to the assignment stage. In the auction, MTN and Mafab emerged provisional licence winners and arising from this, the winning bid price for the auction was put at $273.6 million for each lot of 100 MHz TDD. The provisional licence winners were then directed to pay the winning bid price less the intention-to-bid deposit, by February 24, 2022.
