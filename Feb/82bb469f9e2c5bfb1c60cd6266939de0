Abuja – In the aftermath of the return of two important Nigerian artefacts from the United Kingdom, President Muhammadu Buhari has vowed that the Federal Government will pursue the repatriation of Nigerian artefacts vigorously. To this end, President Buhari has appealed to nations, institutions and bodies, both private and public, to return Nigeria’s artefacts in their possession. The president welcomed the official handover on Saturday of the Okwukor and the head of an Oba of Benin bronze, to the Oba of Benin, His Royal Highness, Oba Ewuare II. They were repatriated from the University of Cambridge and University of Aberdeen, respectively, in the United Kingdom, after 125 years of their leaving the territory of present day Nigeria. 2023: S-South APC Lawmakers Endorse Yahaya Bello For President Northern Forum Rescinds Call For Sack Of NNPC Management He pledged that government would ensure that they are put to good and proper use on their return in museums and other facilities in conjunction with the royal families and kingdoms that lost these artifacts. The president noted that in line with international law and practice, export, import and control over antiquities are matters within the purview of national governments to be exercised on behalf of sub-national authorities, institutions and bodies. He thanked the government of the United Kingdom that facilitated the return of these artefacts by issuing the prerequisite export permits to Nigeria at no cost, as well as the University of Cambridge and the University of Aberdeen who agreed to return these artefacts to Nigeria. “These are unprecedented moves worth emulating by others,” he said, adding that the Federal Government hopes to work hand in hand in future to encourage the return of more Nigerian artefacts from the United Kingdom.
