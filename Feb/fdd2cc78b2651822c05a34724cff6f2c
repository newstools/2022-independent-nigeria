ABUJA  – The upper chamber of the National Assembly has expressed anger over pay­ment of N13,419,800 premi­um to insurance brokers for grounded aircraft by the Nigerian Immigration Service (NIS). The Committee on Pub­lic Account, which flayed the NIS over this develop­ment, asked the agency to recover the money. The committee hinged the investigation of NIS on the 2016- 2018 reports of Auditor General of the Federation. Wife Reportedly Stabs Husband’s Nephew Over Broken Mirror Analysing The Retaining, Removal Of Nigeria’s Oil Subsidy Responding, the Dep­uty Controller in Charge of Directorate Account, Wuraola Adepoju ex­plained that when the premium was paid to the insurance broker, the air­craft were available before presidential order that they be ceded to the Nige­rian Air Force. She added that NIS had the Aircrafts, but, un­fortunately, she could not present the picture of the Aircrafts to the Committee Chaired by Senator Mat­thew Urhoghide. She therefore asked the panel to give her one week grace to show the aircraft to the panel. In one premium paid by immigration, it showed N13.4 million in 2016, while that of renewal endorse­ment for year 2014/2015 and 2015/2016, were not showed to the panel to know the to­tal amount paid for unser­viceable aircraft.
