LAGOS  – Group Managing Direc­tor of Access Bank Plc, Dr Herbert Wigwe has stated that ending Human Immu­nodeficiency Virus (HIV) in Nigeria is possible when Ni­gerians take responsibility collectively. Wigwe said this at the launch of the 100 million dollars HIV Trust Fund of Nigeria in Abuja. He urged the private sec­tor to rise up to the occasion by working in collaboration with the government in the area of ownership in sustain­ing the HIV response.

Wigwe, who said that Ni­geria currently had the third largest HIV epidemic statis­tics worldwide, said over 80 per cent of the funding had been mainly from interna­tional donors. According to him, the Nigerian private sector cur­rently contributes about 2% of total funds allocated to HIV. He urged the private sec­tor to collectively join hands in the ownership of the fund­ing to eradicate HIV in Nige­ria, asserting the readiness of Access bank to support an improved health system.
