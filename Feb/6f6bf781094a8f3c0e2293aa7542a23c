Manchester United face Watford in the Premier League today – with Anthony Elanga eyeing a starting role after his midweek heroics. The Red Devils salvaged a 1-1 draw out of their last-16 trip to Atletico Madrid in the Champions League thanks to the teenager’s late goal, having come on as a 75th-minute substitute. Ralf Rangnick has a decision to make over whether to start Elanga ahead of either Jadon Sancho or Marcus Rashford, the latter of whom has struggled for form in recent weeks.

Scott McTominay will not return for United however, after failing to shake off the bout of illness that kept him out of the Madrid trip. Mason Greenwood continues to be unavailable for selection. “The situation is exactly the same,” Rangnick stated. “[Cavani] hasn’t been training with us so he won’t be available for tomorrow’s game and the same is true with Scotty. “He is still ill, he hasn’t been training with us, so hopefully he will start training with us again next week, but for tomorrow’s game they will both be unavailable.” Manchester United starting XI: De Gea, Wan-Bissaka, Lindelof, Varane, Alex Telles, Fred, Matic, Elanga, Bruno Fernandes, Pogba, Ronaldo.
