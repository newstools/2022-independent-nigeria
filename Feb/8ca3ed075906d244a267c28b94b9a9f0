Birnin Kebbi – Kebbi state chairman of Nigerian veterinary association NVMA Dr Nuhu Hussaini has said that within three years his association has succeeded in identifying and vaccinating over sixty thousand dogs against rabies in Kebbi state. According to him, the successful vaccination occurred in the years 2019 20,000 were vaccinated, in 2020 and 2021 another 20,000 dogs were vaccinated with intervention from the state government. He stated that their consistent campaign and advocacy against rabies dogs aided in achieving the positive results, he mentioned that a rabies infected dog should be reported to vet hospital not killed as they received a report in 2020 that, a rabies infected dog bitten some body but when they got there it had been killed, while in a similar case they retrieved the head of the dog and sample was sent it was positive, so people should report instead of killing them in order to save more people in case it has infected other dogs which if left undetected can spread into the communities. Wastages On Food Production, Pure Reflection Of Unprofessional… Fairtrade Messe Collaborates OTACCWA To Host Exhibition On… On patronage he said they have succeeded in getting people to do away with the tradition and culture of slaughtering animals without bringing them to vet hospital ” we have enough man power and equipment to treat animals and birds as we have at least 96 veterinary doctors and animals science personnel in the state ready to attend to all diseases of animals much more than human doctors as confirmed by animals owners who wished human doctors can treat them that way he said. Another important job of veterinarians is that, they visit abattoir on daily basis to inspect animals before they are slaughtered and after because some diseases manifest after the animal has been slaughtered therefore re-examining the carcass is inevitable before the meat can be certified safe for consumption by humans.He lauded the state government for undertaking a construction of an ultra modern veterinary hospital which after completion will be the best in west Africa as it has all the facilities required like ultra sound, x-ray and other equipment for effectiveness “so people should continue to patronize animals hospitals in order to save the lives of animals that can be a sure means of survival to owners as they multiply to create value chain. At association level he said Kebbi chapter has been adjudged the most active chapter as other chapters copy from them due to their activeness, he commended the state government for their support in their quest to save both animals and humans because they co-exist.
