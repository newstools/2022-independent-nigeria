Christian Eriksen says he has no anxiety about playing his first match since a cardiac arrest ahead of his Premier League debut for Brentford. The 29-year-old has not played a competitive game of football since he suffered a cardiac arrest during Denmark’s match against Finland at Euro 2020 last June. Eriksen was not allowed to continue his career in Italy with Inter Milan despite having an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) fitted. The Italian club therefore allowed him to leave on a free transfer.

He signed a six-month deal with the west London club. Eriksen said: “It is getting closer and closer by, I do feel in my head and body that the excitement is coming, the adrenaline is coming more and more towards game time. “If there was any anxiety, I wouldn’t go back. If I wasn’t fully committed and felt like I trusting of the doctors, trusting of my heart, trusting of my ICD in me, then I wouldn’t go back. No, I feel 100 per cent secure to go back.” Head coach Thomas Frank, however, is not setting a date as to when Eriksen will get his Brentford debut. Frank confirmed it will not be on Saturday when Brentford take on Crystal Palace. POLL Frank said: “(Eriksen) looks like the quality player we know he is. It’s a joy watching him play I must say.” The 29-year-old will play in a behind-closed-doors friendly on Monday to help build up his fitness.
