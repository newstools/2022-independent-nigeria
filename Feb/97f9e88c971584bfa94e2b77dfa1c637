Defining the differentiation between who a leader is and a manger, the NCRIB Governing Council chairman describes a leader as one who influences a group of people towards the achievement of a common goal while a manager is one who sets in motion, strategies and measures needed in achieving organisational goals. As the name implies, a manager manages. A manager is usually seen in the organization as a “Boss”. According to him, a managerial leader is one with lesser influence contending that people often follow such leaders because they are in position to be served and not because they influence people to follow them while they (leaders) see their followers as tools to achieve an objective. Accordingly, Edu observed that a relational leader is one who builds relationships with others to influence his followers. His major focus is the network of people he can surround himself with to induce followership. Such leaders often lack specialized knowledge and not willing to make sacrifices to develop their core competences.
