The actress and comedian, Rosie O’Donnell, 59, recently had a run-in with the actress, Priyanka Chopra and her husband, Nick Jonas, in Miami where she mistakenly thought self-help guru Deepak Chopra was Priyanka’s father simply because they share the same last name. O’Donnell said she felt embarrassed by the mix up. She later added, “To Nick Jonas, I apologize, and to the Chopra wife, I apologise too.” That wasn’t enough for Chopra, however, who shared her thoughts on Instagram Wednesday night.

Some thoughts…,” the Bollywood star began. “I have never taken myself so seriously to think everyone would know who I am, or my work for that matter,” she continued. “But if you wanted to make a public apology for a very awkward private encounter, I think probably best to take the time to google my name before doing it or even try to reach out directly. “We ALL deserve to be respected for our unique individuality and not be referred to as ‘someone’ or ‘wife’ especially in a sincere apology,” she added. “If we can learn to respect our differences in an authentic way, the world we raise our children in, will be amazing.” “PS,” the actress concluded. “As I’ve said before, not all Chopras are related to the great Deepak, just as not all Smiths are related to the legendary Will Smith.” Jonas later re-shared his wife’s statement in an Instagram Story of his own, writing, “Well said my love.”
