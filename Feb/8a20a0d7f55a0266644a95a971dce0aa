Inter Miami co-owner Jorge Mas has confirmed that he plans to ‘push’ to sign Lionel Messi and hopes to use David Beckham’s links with Paris Saint-Germain to facilitate the transfer. The MLS side have never shied away from a desire to sign Messi, whose interest in a switch to the United States has been known for a while now. Messi is on a two-year contract in Paris which also contains the option for an extension, but there have been rumours that the 34-year-old could quit Ligue 1 after just one season and Mas was asked for his opinion on that story.

Look, we’ll push. I’m an optimist at heart. Could I see that happening? It’s a possibility.” Beckham was a little more coy on the speculation but did confess that he dreams of bringing the world’s biggest players to Miami. “I’ve always said I want the best players in our club and playing in our shirt because there’s a certain expectation,” he added. “Unfortunately, sometimes it can be a bad thing. But most of the time it’s a good thing. “When I first started this project, people were saying ‘This guy is coming, that guy is coming, [Cristiano] Ronaldo is coming, Messi’s coming.’ At the end of the day, we need to win, whether it’s with the young kids or stars. POLL “Our fans will be happy if we have stars on the team, but they’ll be even happier if they’re seeing young players coming through our academy and lifting the MLS Cup.”
