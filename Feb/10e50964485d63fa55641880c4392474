The scarcity of fuel is biting harder in Bayelsa State as more filling stations operated by the independent petroleum marketers remained shut for business within Yenagoa and its environs at the weekend. A few of the petrol stations that opened for business around the Isaac Boro Expressway are selling a litre of the petroleum product for N250 and N300. It was gathered on Sunday that only the NNPC mega filling station along the Sani Abacha Expressway and another NNPC-affiliated facility at the Akenfa suburb of the state capital dispensed fuel at N162 per litre. FG Links Fuel Scarcity To Inspection Failure Inclusive Prosperity, Challenge To Governance In Nigeria –… This had resulted in a long queue of vehicles at both stations even as consumers with different sizes of jerrycans scrambled to buy the product. Last week, a litre of petrol was sold for N170, N185, N195, N200, N215 and N250 per litre at various filling stations operated by the independent dealers in the state. Black market operators were also seen making brisk business as they sold a 10-litre jerrycan of fuel for N2,00 and 20 litres for N4, 000. Residents of Yenagoa are groaning under the acute shortage of fuel supply as most parts of the city had been experiencing prolonged blackouts from the Port Harcourt Electricity Distribution Company for weeks. The management of NNPC, it would be recalled, had on Wednesday said it had over one billion litres of clean petrol in its stock for nationwide distribution. POLL It also stated that 2.3 billion litres of fuel would arrive in Nigeria between Wednesday and the end of the month to restore sufficiency.
