The rapper has repeatedly attacked the Saturday Night Live star in a series of posts on social media, which he later deleted. West, who suffers from bipolar disorder, also threatened to “beat Pete Davidson’s a**” in a song released last month.It seems the row over Kanye West’s divorce from reality TV star Kim Kardashian is getting more dramatic with every passing day. On Monday, the 22-time Grammy winner posted screenshots allegedly showing conversations with his estranged wife. He later deleted them. The first images shows a purported message from Kardashian, which read: “U are creating a dangerous and scary environment and someone will hurt Pete and this will all be your fault.”West accompanied the screenshot with an image from a 2001movie ‘Baby Boy’ where one man is choking another. In a message to the post he called Pete Davidson “skete”, a slang term, which refers to male ejaculate. “Upon my wife’s request, please nobody do anything physical to skete I’m going to handle the situation myself,” the 44-year-old wrote.
