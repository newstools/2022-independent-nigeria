LAGOS  – The Association of Senior Staff of Banks, Insurance and Financial Institutions (ASSBIFI),has raised the alarm over high rate of youth unemployment, multidimensional poverty and all manner of social vices perpetrated mostly by young people in the country. Comrade Oyinkan Olasanoye, ASSBIFI’s President, who made the observations in an exclusive interview with Daily Independent, said in spite of the challenges, the country is blessed with a crop of young people who have chosen not to be a part of the problem, but are striving daily to create value-adding changes from the long-standing challenges and utilising their platforms to inspire and empower other young people. Olasanoye, who also described the precarious work condition in all the sectors in the nation’s economy as pathetic, blamed the high unemployment rate in the country as a reason for the increased number of contract workers, for instance in the finance sector.
