AKURE – Senior Pastor of Awaiting The Second Coming Of Christ Ministry, Adewale Giwa has called on President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine to use everything at his disposal to cease fire and dialogue with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Russian forces had pressed into Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second-largest city, destroying oil and gas installations on the fourth day of fighting in the biggest assault on a European state since World War II. While addressing his members on Sunday, Giwa specifically advised President Zelensky to apply wisdom in resolving the war for the sake of Ukranians. Putin Puts Nuclear ‘Deterrence’ Forces On Alert EU To Shut Airspace To Russian Airlines According to the pastor, “Putin has nothing to lose, and that should give Zelensky a strong signal to succumb to him now. “The word of God must fulfil according to Matthew 24:7 that says nation would rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. “However, it is a common sense that you don’t wrestle against someone who is stronger than you. Listen to him and use wisdom to get what you want. “Don’t allow anyone push you to something that you can’t control. Your citizens are fleeing from the war and crossing borders to the West in search of safety while your opponent is busy, destroying your nation. “Let me repeat again, Russia has nothing to lose, try and study history. There is more to something than meets the eye.”
