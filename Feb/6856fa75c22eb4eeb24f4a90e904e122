Bollywood star Shah Rukh Khan has spoken about his son Aryan not being interested in acting several times in the past but it seems Aryan is still interested in the film industry. According to media reports, the young Khan has expressed an interest in writing. According to Pinkvilla’s sources, Aryan has been silently working towards developing multiple ideas that have the potential of being developed into feature films and web-series. “Of all the ideas in development, the two in the forefront is a web-series for Amazon Prime and a feature film to be bankrolled by Red Chillies Entertainment. The Amazon Prime series is said to be about the life of a die-hard fan with some elements of thrill, however, the details of feature films are not known yet. If everything proceeds at the right pace, there’s a strong possibility of the show being green lit by the platform this year itself,” revealed a source close to the development.

Aryan is also working on other projects with the same production house with Bilal Siddiqi as his co-writer, the sources claimed. The King of Bollywood’s daughter Suhana has ventured into the industry too — she’s to make her debut in Zoya Akhtar’s Bollywood adaptation of the Archie Comics for Netflix, likely to air this year. She was also featured on the cover of Vogue India in 2018, leading to accusations of nepotism. King Khan is currently working on multiple projects such as Indian director Atlee’s film, Pathan and Indian director Rajkumar Hirani’s social comedy.
