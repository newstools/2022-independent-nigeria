LAGOS  – President of the Textile, Garments And Tailoring Senior Staff Association Of Nigeria (TGTSSAN), Comrade Babatunde Alamutu has decried non-availability of skilled manpower in the country. Comrade Alamutu, who in an exclusive interview with our correspondent, argued that the percentage of unqualified personnel was on the rise, and it was affecting productivity and economy, urged employers of labour to organise training programmes for their new intakes, saying: “Nigeria has a huge skill gap in many levels.” He emphasised the need for government, key players in creative industries and labour organisations to key into the digital ecosystem through youth’s capacity building to boost employment opportunities. ASSBIFI Decries Unemployment, Poverty In Nigeria Ondo Supports Entrepreneurs With Equipment Grants Echoing the issue of less-skilled labour and how to abate the situation, Comrade Alamutu, pointed that philanthropy in the country was hinged highly on benevolence rather than impact. “The major problem in Nigeria is that we are not strategic with our charity and we have made people poorer because of goodwill,” he said. He said youth empowerment will provide a value chain of employment for Nigerians, and thereby reduce the burden of idleness among the youths. To this effect, he stressed the need for more entrepreneurial, mentorship and vocational training programmes nationwide.
