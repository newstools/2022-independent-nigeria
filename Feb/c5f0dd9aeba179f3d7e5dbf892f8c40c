The D’Tigress have inched closer to the 2022 FIBA Women’s World Cup following a 65-67 victory over France in a qualification match on Friday. Friday’s win was the first time the African champions have beaten their European counterpart. ‘We Came, We Triumphed’“We came. We saw. We triumphed,” the D’Tigress tweeted on their handle, minutes after the game. “What was your best part of the game today?” Tokyo Olympics: D’Tigress Slump To Third Straight Defeat Nigeria’s next match is against Mali.

They were beaten 90-76. But Coach Otis Hughley was optimistic that his team will bounce back from the setback. “China is really good but no excuses,” Hughley said after the China defeat. “I thought the girls did not quit. I thought they played hard; I thought they had a physical game and by the second half, they were up to the task.” The FIBA Women’s World Cup is billed for September in Australia.
