BENIN – The National Drug Law Enforce­ment Agency, (NDLEA), Edo State Command has said the state ranked low since its intensified war on drug barons, illicit drug, drug abusers, dealers and the like nationwide. An official of the agency who pleaded anonymity, in a chat with newsmen said that not less than 30 states are under pressure over the new wave of anti-drug campaign and operations of the agency. Investigation revealed that Edo State seems to be relatively free from attacks, launched by the agen­cy recently.

We are really happy Edo is not under attack by the agency. “Not that there are no drug deal­ers in Edo, but the ability of the agency in Edo State to curb their unwanted activities has really spurred the result we see today. Ku­dos to the operatives of the agen­cy in Edo; how I wish other states can understudy Edo NDLEA,” our source said.
