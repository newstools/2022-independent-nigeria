Bayern Munich fell to a shock 4-2 Bundesliga defeat against Bochum just four days ahead of their return to Champions League action. Julian Nagelsmann’s side remain nine points clear at the summit of the German top-flight with 13 rounds of the campaign left to play but this will be a concerning result. Robert Lewandowski netted twice to take his Bundesliga tally up to 26 goals in just 22 appearances but it was not enough to prevent the humbling defeat at Bochum.
