Liverpool won the Carabao Cup final in a mammoth penalty shootout after an end-to-end final somehow finished goalless after 90 minutes. Goalkeeper Caoimhin Kelleher scored Liverpool’s 11th kick, before Chelsea substitute stopper Kepa Arrizabalaga skied his over the bar. James Milner, Fabinho, Virgil van Dijk, Trent Alexander-Arnold, Mo Salah, Diogo Jota, Divock Origi, Andy Robertson, Harvey Elliott and Ibrahima Konate all scored from the spot for the Reds in a frantic shootout.

Liverpool then thought they’d taken the lead only for Joel Matip to have a close range effort ruled out by VAR for a marginal offside against Virgil van Dijk, with Luis Diaz also bringing a smart stop from the excellent Mendy. Kai Havertz had a headed goal disallowed, and Mendy saved again from a Van Dijk header from a corner. Substitute Romelu Lukaku then saw another goal disallowed for a tight offside in extra-time, and then Havertz had yet another in the second period.
