The Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC) has threatened to seal any fuel station with Premium Motor Spirit that has refused to dispense fuel and marketers hoarding the product. Taraba State is one of the states hit by fuel scarcity with black marketers taking advantage of the scarcity to sell by the roadside. The NSCDC commandant in the state, Edwin Ugwuji in an interview with Channels Television lamented that fuel stations are under lock and key but they are deliberately shut to exploit citizens.

He said, “If they have fuel in their tanks, they must sell, but some are hoarding the fuel to sell to black marketers and that is what we are trying to discourage ” “If there is any marketer that has gone contrary to the stipulated regulation, we will seal the filling station, after which we can take the matter to court,” Ugwuji said. From investigations, what they told me is that the cost of lifting the fuel is very high, but I do not want to believe it, because they have been lifting the fuel long ago and it is not the first time, so I think they need to come out with a very strategic action plan. “We are strongly against them shortchanging the public and we would not stop until the needful is done,” he added.
