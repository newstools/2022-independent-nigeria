The Premier League has confirmed new dates for six fixtures that were postponed earlier in the season, including Liverpool’s clash with Arsenal at the Emirates Stadium. Numerous Premier League games were called off in December and January as a result of clubs claiming they were unable to field full squads as a result of Covid-19 and injuries. Some of those games, including Manchester United’s clashes with Brentford and Brighton, have already been rescheduled and played. But the sheer number of matches that needed to be rearranged in an increasingly shorter timeframe have made it an incredible challenge.
