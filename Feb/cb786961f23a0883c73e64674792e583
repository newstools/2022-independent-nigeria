Milan are open to keeping Zlatan Ibrahimovic, but not at his current salary. They have already offered him a new deal, although they do not expect to get an answer soon. They have been in talks with him and his entourage since before the end of the January window, Tuttomercatoweb reports. The Swedish striker currently earns €7M per season. Despite his injury woes, the Rossoneri value his charismatic presence in the locker room. According to the publication, Milan proposed €2.5M to Ibrahimovic to extend his contract until June 2023. It would be a steep pay cut. The 40-year-old is set to take his time before responding. He is not too preoccupied with the economic element but rather with his physique. He has missed time on multiple occasions in the last 18 months due to nagging injuries. A sore Achilles tendon has kept him on the sidelines for about a month. He should be back soon, though.
