Bayern Munich forward Thomas Muller and his wife have been slammed for selling horse semen. In a week dominated by news of Kurt Zouma shamefully abusing his cat and Chris Kirkland outlandishly comparing it to racism, things have gotten even stranger with former World Cup winner Muller and wife Lisa coming under fire from animal rights organisation PETA. Muller and Lisa, a champion dressage rider, own a farm and reportedly use the horses as studs, selling frozen horse semen for €200 (£168) a pop.

Muller said: “Sadly we have bad news. Our favourite D’Avie will not be available in the next months. “Unfortunately he slipped during a test attempt to prepare for the breeding season, and dramatically fell on his side. “He suffered an injury in the hoof area, and will need to rest completely for the next few months. “He’s a tough lad, and it could have been worse.”
