This has fueled optimism that the bank would not only pay dividend for the third consecutive year, but a bigger dividend payout might also be in the pipeline. Explaining the facts behind the figures following the release of the bank’s 2021 Q3 result, the bank’s Chief Finance Officer, Tunde Mabawonku, said: “The key measure of success for us is growth in customer numbers and customer activity – and we are glad that we are reporting strong growth here. “Deposit liabilities grew by 9.3 per cent to N879.8billion in 9M 2021 from N804.9billion in FY 2020 while Total Asset increased by 10.7 per cent to N1.08 trillion in nine months of 2021 from N979.5 billion in FY 2020. We have also unveiled our new Mission and Vision statements which align with our strategy for the year.” Mabawonku further buttressed that the bank is “sure to close the year with an even stronger performance, while we continue to focus on our digital business which is a key boost for customer acquisition, consumer lending, and transaction volumes while not neglecting our corporate commercial play.”
