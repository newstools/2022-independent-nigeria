Chelsea finished last season with the eighth largest wage bill in European football, according to figures released by UEFA this week. In a season that saw Frank Lampard sacked, Thomas Tuchel hired, an FA Cup final reached and a second Champions League trophy won, the Blues racked up a total wage bill of £270million, £211million of which was made up of player wages. Chelsea were not shy in splashing the cash at the start of Lampard’s second season in charge. Everton To Launch Summer Move For Chelsea Starlet Chelsea Eyeing Move For Declan Rice Kai Havertz, Timo Werner, Ben Chilwell, Hakim Ziyech, Edouard Mendy and Thiago Silva were all brought in and were all likely handed lucrative wages from the offset. Willian, Pedro and Alvaro Morata were all sold or released, however, no doubt easing the pressure on the purse strings slightly themselves. According to Spotrac, Chelsea’s highest earner during the campaign was N’Golo Kante, who apparently earned £290,000-per-week and just over £15million in the year. With Kante now into his 30s and less than 18 months remaining on his contract, could the Blues be tempted to sell in the summer and give themselves a hefty saving? Timo Werner and Ben Chilwell were the second and third biggest earners respectively, while Antonio Rudiger sat in 14th. POLL However, next season will likely see the Blues’ figure rise significantly, once Romelu Lukaku’s arrival is taking into account. The Belgian is currently earning £325,000-per-week (£16.9 million a year), making him comfortably the club’s largest earner. The UEFA wage table was topped by Barcelona last season which, given the summer drama that saw them forced into letting Lionel Messi leave for nothing, is maybe not too big a surprise. Manchester City came in second having spent £330million on player wages and £102million elsewhere. Real Madrid and Paris Saint-Germain followed close behind before Liverpool, Bayern Munich and Manchester United completed the clubs ahead of Chelsea.
