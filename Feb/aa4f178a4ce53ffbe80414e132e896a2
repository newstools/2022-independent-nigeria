At a televised meeting with Russia’s security council, Putin told Ukrainian military, “Take power into your own hands, it will be easier for us to reach agreement.” Concerned Nigerians’ Adeyanju Lauds Buhari For Signing… Nigeria Urges Russia To Withdraw Troops From Ukraine He claimed that Russian soldiers in Ukraine are acting “bravely, professionally and heroically.” According to The Guardian, the Russian president reiterated his claim that Ukrainian leadership had been engaged in “genocide”. “We are fighting with nationalist groups that are directly responsible for the genocide of the Donbas and the bloodshed of peaceful civilians in the two republics,” he was quoted as saying. Earlier, Putin had said the Russian military operation aims to ensure a demilitarisation of Ukraine, even as he urged Ukrainian servicemen to immediately put down arms and go home. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov had said Moscow is ready for talks at “any moment” with Ukraine once the Ukrainian military lay down their arms. Russia sees no possibility of recognising the Ukrainian government as democratic given that it is oppressing and using methods of genocide against its own people, Lavrov alleged.
