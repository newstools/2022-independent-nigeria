…Explains Why S’East Should Support Him ABUJA – The Igbo youth organization has thrown its weight behind the presidential aspiration of Bauchi State Governor Bala Mohammed ahead of the 2023 presidential polls. The Igbo youth under the aegis of Youth Vanguard also adduced reasons why the people of the South-East should back the presidential aspiration of Governor Bala Mohammed. Sowore To Make Presidential Declaration Next Week 2023 Presidential Election Holds February 25 2023 Rising from its delegates assembly held in Enugu, the group in a communique signed by its National Coordinator, Comrade Ede Maduka and Director of Strategy, Prince Uma Uduma, averred that they have been closely monitoring Bala Mohammed’s political and public service antecedents from when he was a Senator and led the charge on the Doctrine of Necessity that made Dr Goodluck Jonathan Acting President. “And also, from when he was a high performing FCT minister who ran an inclusive government to now that he is revolutionizing governance in Bauchi state. The Igbo Youth Vanguard also stressed that Governor Bala Mohammed speaks plainly and straight to the point so he can be counted upon to protect the core interests of the South East if he wins the PDP nomination and is elected into office.” The group urged South-East political leaders to combine their quest for the presidency with a strategic negotiation with Bala Mohammed in case they are disappointed down the line. The group also aligned itself with the recent postulations of Prof Udenta O Udenta, the Founding National Secretary of Alliance for Democracy, who declared recently that rather than wait to be betrayed by her Southern political colleagues, who are unwilling to zone the presidency specifically to the South-East zone, they should play smart politics by adopting Gov Bala Mohammed as their choice right from the word go. POLL They commended Prof Udenta’s clarity of mind and thought, visionary political insights and uncommon courage, declaring that more of such are needed by South East political leaders.
