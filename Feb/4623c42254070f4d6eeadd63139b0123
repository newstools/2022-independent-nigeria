ABUJA  – The Director-General of the Federal Capital Hospital Ser­vices Management Board, Dr. Mohammed Kawu on Friday stated that the main building and other important struc­tures of the Asokoro District Hospital were not affected by the fire incident which oc­curred on Thursday. Kawu hinted that the clar­ification became necessary against the backdrop of re­ports in some sections of the media that the entire build­ing structures at the Asokoro District Hospital have been razed by fire. According to him in a statement made available to newsmen in Abuja by the Se­nior Special Assistant to FCT Minister on Strategy Com­munication, Malam Abuba­kar Sani stated that: “Fire was noticed at about 12 noon at the IHVN and Tuberculo­sis portacabin that is located at the back of the hospital main building. These porta cabins are isolated from the main building and so the fire did not pose any threat to the structures which house patients.” Orientation: Call-Up-Letters Out On Sunday, COVID-19 Rapid… Ikeja Golden Lions Club Applauded For Touching Lives Of… He explained that the FCT fire service was called in and they responded promptly and were able to contain the fire.
