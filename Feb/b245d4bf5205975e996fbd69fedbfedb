Meanwhile, after three hours of waiting in limbo the judge, therefore, issued a bench warrant and ordered her arrest and detention until the next adjournment. The judge said her absence in court without any reason was an affront and a mockery of the court and judicial process and there was a need for the court to take action. He also ordered her surety to be present in court at the next adjourned date. The judge, thereaftere, adjourned the case to March 17, 2022, for hearing. POLL Recall that Jaruma was admitted to bail on January 28, 2022, with a surety with Grade Level 12 working within the Federal Capital Territory  ( FCT ). The court also cautioned the parties in the case to maintain decorum and avoid making public comments on social media platforms that would be prejudiced in the case. Jaruma was arrested on January 21, 2022, on the orders of Ned Nwoko after she alleged that Regina used her products to ‘grab’ Ned Nwoko, a claim the latter refuted.
