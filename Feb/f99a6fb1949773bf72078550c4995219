Shuaibu Ibrahim, the Director-General of the National Youth Service Corps, has lamented about the lack of white collar jobs in the country, stating that the service will provide jobs for millions of Nigerians through the Skill Acquisition and Entrepreneurship Department (SEAD) programme. The Nigerian Army General disclosed this on Monday while addressing prospective corp members in a welcome speech ahead of their swearing-in ceremony on Tuesday, urging them to participate in the SEAD programme as there are no jobs in Nigeria. He further urged the prospective corp members to go ahead in establishing different businesses from their acquired skill in the camp, so that they don’t need to go after white collar jobs.

So take advantage of the skill acquisition training that you are going to undergo in camp and ensure that you are serious with the training,” the NYSC DG said.
