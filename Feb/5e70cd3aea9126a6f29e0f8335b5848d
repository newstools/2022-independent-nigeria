LAGOS – Nigerian activist, businesswoman co-founder of the #BringBackOurGirls movement, Aisha Yesufu  has expressed disappointment at the manner in which some electorates result to violence in their support of politicians contesting public offices. She made the expression on her official twitter handle, @AishaYesufu, while condemning how people degenerate to the level of violently attacking each other in their support for politicians. “Its so sad seeing how many people degenerate just to defend someone who is going to be a public servant & should be questioned thoroughly! The vile attacks are so shameful. We didn’t learn from the vileness of Jonathanians/Gejites & Buharists. We are breeding more sadly.” Spotlight On Uzodimma’s Two Years Of Stewardship In Imo I Strongly Believe That Obaseki Won’t Return To APC – Aziegbemi… See tweet below;
