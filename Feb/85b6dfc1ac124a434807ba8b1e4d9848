LAGOS – Just like in the third quarter of 2021, Nigeria’s gross domestic product (GDP) slowed in the fourth quarter of the same year as it recorded 3.98 per cent growth, according to the report released by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) in Abuja on Thursday. The GDP was 0.11 per cent in the first quarter 0f 2021, 5.01 per cent in the second quarter, but slowed to 4.03 per cent in the third quarter.

However, analytically, it is not when viewed in terms of the base effect of the corresponding period in Q4 of 2020 when the economy recorded a GDP growth rate of 0.11 per cent as against the growth rate recorded in Q3 of the same year which was -3.62 per cent. In nominal terms, aggregate GDP stood at N49.28 trillion in the fourth quarter of 2021. This performance is higher when compared to fourth quarter 2020 which recorded N43.56 trillion, indicating a year-on-year nominal growth rate of 13.11 per cent. Nominal Gross Domestic Product in the preceding quarter of Q3 2021 stood at N45.11 trillion. Annual Nominal Value in 2021 was N173.53 trillion as against N152.32 trillion in 2020, showing a growth rate of 13.92 per cent. In terms of real GDP which shows volume of economic activities, fourth quarter 2021 recorded N20.33 trillion, higher by N778.91 billion than N19.55 trillion recorded in fourth quarter 2020. This shows output growth of 3.98 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2021. Moreover, output of the fourth quarter of 2021 was higher by N1.79 trillion compared to third quarter 2021 when aggregate real GDP was N18.54 trillion. Annual real value of 2021 stood at N72.39 trillion compared to N70.01 trillion in 2020. In terms of oil performance, an average daily oil production of 1.50 million barrels per day (mbpd) was recorded in the fourth quarter of 2021. This shows a lower volume compared to 1.56mbpd recorded in Q4 2020 by 0.06mbpd. Fourth quarter 2021 daily oil production also shows lower volume compared to the third quarter 2021 production volume of 1.57mbpd. POLL This trend accounts for oil growth rate of -8.06% in real terms recorded in fourth quarter 2021 and annual growth rate of -8.30 per cent in 2021. Additionally, during the fourth quarter 2021, oil contributed 5.19 per cent to Gross Domestic Product from 5.87 per cent contributed in fourth quarter 2020. On an annual basis, oil contributed 7.24 per cent compared to 8.16 per cent in 2020. The Non-Oil sector (which excludes Crude Petroleum and Natural Gas activity) recorded growth of 4.73 per cent in fourth quarter 2021 in real terms, an improvement from 1.69 per cent reported in fourth quarter, 2020. However, the growth rate of the Non-Oil sector in third quarter 2021 performed better at 5.44 per cent. Annual growth rate of 4.44 per cent was recorded in 2021 as against -1.25 per cent in 2020. Non-Oil accounted for 94.81 per cent, an increase from 94.13 per cent recorded in fourth quarter 2020, while annual contribution increased from 91.84 per cent in 2020 to 92.76 per cent in 2021. To some analysts the fact that the GDP is receding should be of great concern to any Nigerian because of the fear of sliding into another recession. Many are of the opinion that the size of the economy has grown smaller since 2015 and Nigerians are worse off.

That explains why many Nigerians cannot relate with the latest Gross Domestic Product (GDP) figures put out by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS). Many economists believe that the country’s economic performance in 2021, not significantly improved from the chaotic years since the recession in 2016, is made to look impressive by the impact of the ravaging pandemic in 2020 when the economy shrank by the most in over two decades. They say the relatively high growth rate in 2021 is largely a result of base effects. An Abuja-based economist, Cyril Ampka, is of the opinion that Nigeria, as a country, needs to guide against any slip at a time like this when the country is preparing for a general election in 2023. He said, “I think we need to ensure that we should not find ourselves in the situation we were during the pandemic when the economy went into another recession. We are in a pre-election year where investors may likely take the decision of withholding their interest and watch what may likely be the outcome of the election. “I will suggest that the Federal Government strengthen security in the country”. To Stephen Iloba, another economist, the main reason for the drop lies in the lack of trust of government policies by the [people, especially in the business class who find it difficult to run their businesses because of forex scarcity which seems unabated. “It may sound alarming but it is true that businesses are facing hard times due to scarcity of forex and it seems there is no solution in sight”, Iloba said.
