Israeli Foreign Minister Yair Lapid on Thursday condemned Russia’s military intervention in Ukraine as a “major attack on world order.” The minister made the remarks at the Foreign Ministry while addressing the press after Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered a military operation in Ukraine. “Russia’s attack on Ukraine is a massive attack on world order,” Lapid said, underlining Israel’s readiness “to help the Ukrainian people.” Nigerian Embassy In Ukraine Issues Travel Advice To Citizens,… Russian Invasion: Ukrainians Embark On Safety Exodus He called for halting the Russian military action and for returning to negotiations to peacefully settle the conflict. “Wars are not the right way to resolve conflicts. We can stop this (attack) and return to the negotiating table for a peaceful solution,” he said. Lapid said Tel Aviv has for long enjoyed “good and deep relations” with both Moscow and Kyiv, noting that thousands of Israeli citizens and Jews live in Russia and Ukraine. “Protecting them is our top priority,” he added. The chief Israeli diplomat also urged all Israeli citizens to leave Ukraine and cross the border “while the roads are still open.” POLL Putin early Thursday announced a military intervention in Ukraine, just days after recognizing two separatist-held enclaves in eastern Ukraine. The recognition of Donetsk and Luhansk drew international condemnations and announcements of tougher sanctions on Moscow. There were reports of explosions in several Ukrainian cities, including the capital Kyiv, and several military vehicles reportedly crossed the border from Belarus into Ukraine. In recent months, Putin has amassed over 100,000 Russian troops around Ukraine, but repeatedly denied any intention of invading. (SOURCE: Anadolu Agency)
