The Ijaw Youth Council (IYC), has appealed for calm over the brewing tension between Okomu Oil Palm Company and its host community in Ovia South Local Government Area of Edo. This is contained in a statement by Omaghomi OluDerimon, Secretary, Western Zone of the IYC, and made available to newsmen in Benin on Wednesday. OluDerimon stressed that the appeal for calm became necessary in order not to escalate the issue while the security agencies carry on with their investigation on it.

According to him, “We (IYC) have been briefed on the latest development in Okomu community from different stakeholders and community leaders as per the avoidable incident that cropped up weeks ago that we condemned in its entirety. “We have called on the security agencies and the government to carry out a thorough investigation and bring the culprits to book. “On Tuesday, we got very disturbing information that Okomu Oil Palm Company has blocked the only access road to the communities. “The implication of this is that it has restricted movement, including farm produce in and out of the area. This has further inflicted untold hardship to the people of Okomu and environs. POLL “The IYC calls for total calmness from the people so as not to allow the issue degenerate to total breakdown of law and order. “It’s instructive also that the citizens within Okomu communities should look out for those who wants to foment or instigate trouble pending when all issues will be amicably resolved.” It would be recalled that gunmen had invaded the Okomu Oil Company and killed one worker and destroyed 20 hectares of the company’s rubber plantation.
