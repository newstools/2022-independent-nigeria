Lafia – President Muhammadu Buhari on Thursday in Lafia, Nasarawa State, said he was looking forward to when he will be referred to as ex-president of Nigeria. The president, who is on the last lap of his administration, also tasked leaders who take the oath of office, saying after swearing with the Holy Book, they must be careful not to abuse the trust of leadership placed on them by the people and God. Buhari, who spoke at a courtesy visit to the palace of Emir of Lafia, retired Justice Sidi Bage Muhammad 1, reaffirmed that he has no intention whatsoever to stay beyond the constitutionally recognised two terms of office as leader of Nigeria. “The traditional ruler is on a terminal appointment. Constitutionally, we (elected public office holders) are not. I cannot go beyond two terms and I have sworn by the Holy Quran that I will uphold the constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria.
