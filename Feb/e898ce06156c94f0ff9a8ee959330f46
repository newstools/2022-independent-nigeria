The 27-nation bloc will close its airspace to Russian airlines as part of new sanctions by the bloc against Russia. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen made the announcement on Sunday, also confirming that the bloc would fund supplies of weapons to Ukraine and ban Russian state media Sputnik and RT. “We are shutting down the EU airspace for Russians. We are proposing a prohibition on all Russian-owned, Russian registered or Russian-controlled aircraft. These aircraft will no more be able to land in, take off or overfly the territory of the EU,” she said.
