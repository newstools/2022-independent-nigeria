The world’s largest cargo plane, Ukraine’s Antonov An-225 Mriya, was destroyed by Russian forces during the “special military operation” in Ukraine, said Ukraine’s state defense conglomerate Ukroboronprom, which manages Antonov, on Sunday on Telegram. The aircraft was destroyed in an attack by Russian troops on the Hostomel airport outside Kiev, and restoration of the plane would cost an estimated $3 billion over five years, Ukroboronprom added. A tweet from the Antonov Company said there has been no independent confirmation of the aircraft’s destruction, and it could not verify the “technical condition” of the aircraft until it had been inspected by experts.
