WHO’s Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus and Regional Director for Europe Hans Henri P.

Trucks are unable to transport oxygen supplies from plants to hospitals across the country, including the capital Kyiv,” it said. “The majority of hospitals could exhaust their oxygen reserves within the next 24 hours. Some have already run out. This puts thousands of lives at risk.” The officials noted that power shortages were also putting critical hospital services at risk and ambulances transporting patients were in potential danger of getting caught in the crossfire. President Vladimir Putin ordered the military intervention on Thursday, and has put Russia’s deterrence forces on high alert.
