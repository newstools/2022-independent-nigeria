ABUJA – The Founder of Albino Foundation in Nigeria, Jake Epelle has appealed to journalists to blend their skills with passion and help in adequately disseminating information that will positively change the narratives about persons living with disabilities. While adding that the issues surrounding persons living with disabilities are underreported in the media. Epelle made this appeal at during the Induction ceremony of Journalists for Disability Inclusion (J4DI) on Thursday in Abuja. He also called on media practitioners to take advantage of the provisions of the Discrimination Against Persons With Disabilities Prohibition Act, in their media outreaches, he stated that physical and other forms of disabilities should not be used to deprive any Nigerian of his or her constitutional rights. He, however, noted that with a fair playing ground and support from society, disabilities can be defeated, and victims would be able to maximise their full potential and contribute to Nigeria’s economic growth. Meanwhile, the Interim National President of J4DI and the Chairman of FCT Chapter of Nigeria Union of Journalists (NUJ) Comrade Emmanuel Ogbeche said it was time to galvanise support for those living with disabilities and encourage them to live a productive life. He said it was the duty of media practitioners who are change agents to work towards inclusive Nigeria.
