***Threatens Legal Action Against FG LAGOS –  Northern Youths Council of Nigeria (NYCN) has kicked against the Federal Government’s proposed NIRSAL Micro Finance Bank (MFB) loan to former Niger Delta militants, threatens legal action if the decision is not rescinded. In a press statement on Tuesday, jointly signed by Comrade Isah Abubakar and Comrade Mock Samuel Kure, President and Director General, Media and Publicity of NYCN, respectively, the group stated that it was shocked that despite the huge amount that is released monthly to the presidential Amnesty office, the government is still planning to dish out billions as loan to 1,500 Ex Niger-Delta militants who once raised arms against the state and threatened national unity. The Council notes that, the action of the management of the NIRSAL MFB if not checked, is capable of making graduates who are roaming the streets and have tried in vain to secure the Federal Government’s loan facility, to consider venturing into crime as though that is the surest way of getting government’s attention and interventions.
