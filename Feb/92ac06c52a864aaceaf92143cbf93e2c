The Lagos State Residents Registration Agency (LASRRA) has announced that the newly upgraded Lagos State Resident Identity Card (LAG ID) for residents in the state has been embedded with more features and functionalities that enable card-holders to enjoy and have access to faster and better services from the state government. The new LAG ID is a multi-application smartcard that offers registered residents access to services ranging from means of personal security and identity verification at points of accessing various government services, applying for loans from Lagos State Employment Trust Fund (LSETF) to payment for services across multiple vendors including BRT and LagFerry as well as cash withdrawals from banks’ Automated Teller Machines (ATMs). “The old identity card with very limited functionality is being phased out and replaced with the multipurpose smart card, so holders of the old card need to update their records to obtain the new LAG ID card with a validity period of 5 years.
