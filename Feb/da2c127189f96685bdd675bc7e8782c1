Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang has said the manner of his departure from Arsenal “hurts” as he waits to be announced as a Barcelona player and has insisted he was always “100% focused and committed” at the club. The 32-year-old was pictured training with Barcelona after being released by Arsenal and signing a contract at Camp Nou. Aubameyang wrote on Instagram: “To the Arsenal fans, Thank you for making London home for myself and my family for the past four years. We went through ups and downs together and your support meant everything to me.

I have always been 100 per cent focused and committed on doing everything I can for this club which is why leaving without a real goodbye hurts – but that is football. “I’m sad I did not get the chance to help my teammates in the last few weeks, but I have nothing but respect for this club and truly wish all my guys and the fans all the best and many successful years in the future!” Aubameyang last played for Arsenal in early December after being stripped of the captaincy for disciplinary reasons. The manager, Mikel Arteta, said the Gabon international had failed to demonstrate the “commitment and passion” to play for the club.
