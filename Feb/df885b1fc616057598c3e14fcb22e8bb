He said that such a move would also complement supply from the smallholder farmers through the apex bank’s partnership with the Rice Farmers Association of Nigeria (RIFAN) and prime anchors. He noted that the number of rice mills in Nigeria had grown from less than 10 with a combined capacity of less than 350,000 metric tons in 2015 to over 68 with a combined capacity of three million metric tons as at January.
