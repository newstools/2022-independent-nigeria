ABUJA  – A research and policy analyst has advocated prioritization of surveying and mapping as best solution to the challenges facing the country. The expert further noted that prioritizing surveying and map­ping would help to mitigate the numerous incidents of violent conflicts and crimes as well as the developmental challenges con­fronting the nation. Presenting a paper titled, “Re­forming and Implementing the Survey Coordination Act: Issues, Challenges and the Need for Col­laboration,” the acting Director, Research and Policy Analysis in the Institute for Peace and Conflict Resolution, Dr. Joseph Ochogwu, said surveying and mapping is an essential peace and security tool for conflict prevention, manage­ment and resolution in the society.

We can only do that with a new Survey Co­ordination Act. “I wish to further reinstate that surveying and mapping is an es­sential peace and security tool for conflict prevention, management and resolution in the society, as well as critical for development and governance. Let’s mainstream it into our national life so we can begin to enjoy peace, unity and development.” He noted that the present sur­vey Act is outdated and not fit to address the present challenges. He said: “From what I can dis­cern in our surveying and map­ping sector, we are using new wine in an old keg of wine. “What it means is that, we are struggling to operate a new system using an old instrument of law.”
