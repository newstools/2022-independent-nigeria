LAGOS – Special Assistant to President Buhari on Digital and New Media, Tolu Ogunlesi has stated that the 7-years APC administration in Nigeria has been of immense benefit to the nation than any other party’s. He wrote on his official twitter handle @toluogunlesi, “The idea that PDP is/was less ‘statist’ or more ‘market-friendly’ than APC is one of the biggest enduring myths of this age. No real evidence whatsoever for it. Unless you consider handing out petrol import licenses to every Tom Dickenharry as ‘market-friendliness’.” “7 years of APC have seen more foundational business-enabling reform—PIA, CAMA, BOFIA, FCCPC, SPOMO, NNPC reforms, IOC Cash Call Settlements, Finance Acts, PEBEC, normalized Federal Budget Cycle, ESP, Visa Reform—than 16 years of PDP. If you disagree, argue w/ proof. No insults.” Spotlight On Uzodimma’s Two Years Of Stewardship In Imo I Strongly Believe That Obaseki Won’t Return To APC – Aziegbemi… “The thing with these ‘foundational business reforms’ is that they will take time to manifest. It’s like planting an acorn – the oak tree will take time to emerge. That you can’t see much in the short term can’t/doesn’t diminish the significance of the planting that’s been done.” See tweet below; 7 years of APC have seen more foundational business-enabling reform—PIA, CAMA, BOFIA, FCCPC, SPOMO, NNPC reforms, IOC Cash Call Settlements, Finance Acts, PEBEC, normalized Federal Budget Cycle, ESP, Visa Reform—than 16 years of PDP.If you disagree, argue w/ proof.
