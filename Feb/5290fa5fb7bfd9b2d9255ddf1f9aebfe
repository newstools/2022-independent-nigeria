GOMBE – Hostilities may have returned in remote communities bordering Gombe and Adamawa States in Northeast Nigeria following a fresh outbreak of violence in Nyuwar, Gombe State. Tension had continued to mount from Tuesday afternoon following the shooting of a soldier while trying to repel an attack on Nyuwar community by neighbouring Waja community, our correspondent has gathered. An eyewitness in Nyuwar confirmed to newsmen in Gombe, the State capital through a phone call that the soldier was injured while trying to repel attacks on Nyuwar Community by neighbouring Waja community which carried out similar attack on Nyuwar and Jessu in April last year.

Several houses were said to have been touched while women, children and the aged were forced to escape to neighbouring communities for refuge. In Jessu, a neighbouring community to Nyuwar, panicking residents were reported to be hurriedly trooping out of the town for safety. Nyuwar and Jessu, the two Lunguda communities were reportedly attacked in April last year by the Wajas forcing many residents to relocate to neighbouring communities for safety. Efforts by our correspondent to get police reaction over the latest incident proved abortive as calls made to the command’s Public Relations Officer (PPRO), Mary Obed Malum (SP), were not answered nor returned afterwards. POLL As at the time of filing this report, the State Commissioner for Information Julius Ishaya Lapes told our correspondent that he was still making consultations to get the true situation. He promised to get in touch as soon as he got details on the matter.
