Nepal police fired rubber bullets and tear gas on Sunday as hundreds protested against a $500m US aid grant that has divided the ruling coalition headed by Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba of the Nepali Congress party. The Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) pact signed in 2017 faces opposition mainly from two of the Communist parties that are part of the coalition government. Critics of the pact claim the conditions in the grant agreement will prevail over Nepal’s laws and threaten the country’s sovereignty. They say it is part of Washington’s Indo-Pacific strategy, which has military components that could bring American soldiers to Nepal. Turkish President Welcomed With Official Ceremony In DRC Putin, Macron Agree On Measures To Halt Ukraine Escalation US officials have spoken to Nepalese leaders recently to assure that the grant concerns only Nepal’s development. The money is meant to be used for the construction of power transmission lines and improvement of roads in the Himalayan nation. Hundreds of protesters tried to push through barbed wire barricades and pelted riot police with stones. Police beat them with bamboo batons, fired tear gas and water canons, leaving injured on both sides. “Although they agreed to present the agreement in the parliament, it’s still not clear whether all coalition partners will cast their vote in favour… Our efforts will continue to convince them,” Prakash Sharan Mahat, spokesperson for the ruling Nepali Congress party, told AFP news agency.
