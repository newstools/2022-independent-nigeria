Pastor Solomon Osa-Daniel, the senior Pastor in charge of Fruitful Vine Area of the Redeemed Christian Church of God, Okota, Lagos, who clocked 50, recalled how God shew him great mercy. The cleric was full of thanks to the Almighty God for delivering him from impossible and precarious situations, stated: “I don’t even deserve to be alive today when I reflect and take a retrospective look at the course of my life, the impossible, delicate, sensitive, dangerous and precarious situations I found myself, but God delivered and kept me alive.” He implored Christians to be heavenly conscious, adding that every human endeavour was vanity outside God.
