The Resident Electoral Commissioner, Ambassador (Dr.) Rufus Akeju disclosed this on Friday while address­ing newsmen on the prepara­tion of the commission for the bye-election.

He explained that the BVAS would accredit voters through fingerprints and or facials as well as transmitting the results of polls from polling units to INEC Results Viewing (IRev) portal of the commission in real-time. The bye-election in which seven political parties are participating would hold from 8:30am to 2:30pm.
