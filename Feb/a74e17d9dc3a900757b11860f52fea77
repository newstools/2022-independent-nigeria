LAGOS – The Amalgamated Atiku Support Group (AASG) has sounded a note of warning to Prince Kassim Afegbua, a chieftain of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), to stop distracting former Vice President and presidential candidate of the PDP in the 2019 elections, Alhaji Atiku Abubakar. Afegbua, a former Commissioner for Information in Edo state had said Atiku should not make himself a perpetual candidate for the presidency and quit the stage for younger Nigerians. He also asked Atiku to jettison his ambition as it would be morally wrong for the North to want to retain power after President Muhammadu Buhari must have completed eight years. 2023: A’Ibom Stakeholders Urge Akpanudoedehe To Run For… Basketball Africa League Announces Teams As Season Commences… However, responding to Afegbua, Hon. Oladimeji Fabiyi, Director-General of the AASG said Atiku is not Prince Uche Secondus, former PDP national chairman that Afegbua and his co-travellers ridiculed out of his office. “We know characters like Kassim Afegbua very well. We know where he is coming from Kassim has forgotten that Nigeria has left him behind where he is still standing. “At the appropriate time, he will get a deserved response. He is just an unnecessary distraction as far as I know. I have to sound this as a note of warning to Kassim and his co-travellers that Atiku is not Uche Secondus. “The way you roll a mortar, you can’t roll a pot of made of clay like that because it will break. Atiku is a mortar. What Afegbua tried with Secondus, he can’t try it with Atiku. So, Afegbua is just an unnecessary distraction but we will respond to him soon.”
