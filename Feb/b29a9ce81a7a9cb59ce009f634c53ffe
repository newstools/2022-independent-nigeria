Stanley Eguma, the coach of Rivers United, has said the Pride of Rivers have their sights on winning the Nigeria Professional Football League this sea­son. The highly experi­enced manager said for that reason, the yet-to-be-defeated Pride of Rivers were looking forward to keeping their status and that they were going to Jos to pick the points against Plateau United this weekend. “We planned and worked hard on the re­sults you see these ten matches, in fact our tar­get is not to lose a game as we fix our sight on the trophy this season”. 3SC Promise To Build On Heartland Massacre This Weekend Ilechukwu Promises To Ride On Plateau’s Win At Rangers “Plateau is a good team with ambition but we are going there to get points because it’s not over until it’s over and we don’t need to relent”. The coach was speak­ing at the backdrop of their week 10 win over Dakkada of Uyo, whom they won 2-1 in Port Harcourt on Wednes­day. In the game, it was an­other hero-of-the-match performance from Ishaq Rafiu as his brace pro­pelled Rivers United to pick the maximum points against Dakkada in that keenly contested match day 10 encounter at the Adokiye Amiesimaka Stadium, Port Harcourt on Wednesday. Yet to lose a game this season, the Pride of Rivers looked to grab all points at stake after picking up the precious draw away to fellow early pace setters, Remo Stars. It was not surprising that they started on a brisk get-the-job done note, controlling the tempo of the game in the opening exchanges.
