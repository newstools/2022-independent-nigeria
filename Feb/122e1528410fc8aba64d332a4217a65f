LAGOS  – The Centre for Anti-Corrup­tion and Open Leadership (CACOL) has commended the governor of Lagos State, Baba­jide Sanwo-Olu, for extending a hand of support for two out-of-school girls in the state. The organisation, howev­er, implored him to put all machinery in motion to give effect to the Child Right Act which the state had domesti­cated more than a decade ago. It stressed that if the law had been earlier implemented, there would not be any need for him to stop his convoy to handle the issue of out-of-school children that he found by the road side.

It recalled that the media reported that on his way to an official function recently, San­wo-Olu halted his convoy to at­tend to a disturbing situation. “It was a sight of two un­derage girls on an errand for a bean cake vendor during school hours. The girls were expected to be in school. “But, both Amarachi Chin­edu, 9, and Suwebat Husseini, 12, were forced to skip school by their parents in order to serve some domestic assis­tance,” CACOL stressed. According to the group, “The girls were going to de­liver buckets of peeled beans and pepper to a grinder when the governor sighted them at Anthony Village area. POLL “It was a glance that pre­sented a discomforting image for Sanwo-Olu, who revved his convoy to a stop to find out the reason the girls were not in school.”
