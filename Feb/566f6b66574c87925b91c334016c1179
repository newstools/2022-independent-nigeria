But the few times I met him, I truly fell in love with him because he was a man of strength on the inside. “Though very humble, he was a man that was very courageous and spoke truth to power at all times. And those are the kind of people that can shape a nation and a community. “A songwriter said ‘when we are gone, we would only be remembered by the things we have done and I do know that he has impacted very strongly on our society, the Itsekiri nation and Delta state as a whole because he was truly a leader. “In the church, he played his role and rose to become a Papal Knight. Not so many people get to that level and I know that he was a very strong voice for the Itsekiri nation that we must continue to appreciate. POLL “He was a godly man, with godly integrity. Not the integrity now that appears to be on the face, his own was from the inside and it is something I believe and pray that many of our leaders should try to emulate. “His role in the community was enormous. He served in various capacities, both as employment and appointment. But more importantly, as an elected legislator. “He was a man who could speak his mind without fear. He was somebody who was not afraid to speak truth to power in this state hence, he could genuinely be called an elder statesman,” Okowa stated. Earlier, Rev. Fr. Peter Medugu in his sermon admonished Christians not to be afraid of death if they live right as death was a gateway to eternity. The cleric said man should learn to live right and see life as a preparation for eternity.
