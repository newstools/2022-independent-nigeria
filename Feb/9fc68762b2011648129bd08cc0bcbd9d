BAUCHI – Three months after the All Progressive Congress (APC), conducted its congresses in all the 36 states of the federation, stakeholders of the party from Bauchi Central Senatorial Zone stood their ground that the National Reconciliation Committee has not visited the state to mediate aggrieved members of the party. Recall that the APC National Reconciliation Committee headed by a former Governor of Nasarawa State, Abdullahi Adamu was set up to look into complaints by members of the party after the October 17th, 2021 congress of the party. Bauchi State High Court had on 8th December 2021, issued an order of interim injunction halting Hon Hon Babayo Aliyu from parading himself as Bauchi State Chairman of the APC.

This development is not good for the party given the fact that the 2023 elections is drawing very close” The statement read.
