MAKURDI – The Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU) in Joseph Sarwuan Tarka University, Makurdi (JOSTUM) has said that it would not rule out the possibility of impending strike action during it’s National Executive Council (NEC) meeting slated for this weekend. The Union which lamented the spate of failed promises by the Federal Government (FG), noted that it can not be able to wait much longer for the implementation of their demands. Chairperson of ASUU in JOSTUM, Prof. Simon Ejembi who disclose this in a statement made available to Daily Independent in Makurdi on Wednesday noted that, while ASUU has urged the FG to make real its promises in order to avert an impending strike, the FG should honour its agreement with the Union.

He further stated that the “FG should be courageous enough to make real its promises of encouraging local content in its national economic development policy. UTAS is one hundred percent homegrown by academics in Nigerian universities and at no cost to the federal government. “Why is the federal government insisting on paying for products which its experts can and have willingly developed for free?” he queried. Daily Independent reliably gathered the NEC would take a decision on whether to embark on a strike action or not during its meeting slated for this weekend.
