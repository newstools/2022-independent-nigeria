The crux of the matter stems from the fact that, while a motion on notice for interlocutory injunction duly served on Amaechi and Malami was pending, they disregarded the pendency of the suit on January 19, 2022 and went ahead to present the contentious contract to the Federal Executive Council FEC for award to the Chinese firm. The letter of award of the contract to the CCECC dated January 31, 2022 was attached to the further affidavit along with the CCECC’s acceptance of the contract dated February 4, 2022. Meanwhile, the presiding judge, Justice Ahmed Mohammed has fixed April 26, for determination of the motion on notice seeking interlocutory injunctions against the four defendants in the suit. Plaintiffs in their writ of summons issued by their lead counsel, James Okoh, are asking the court to cancel the letter of “No Objection” issued by the Bureau of Public Procurement (BPP) in favour of CCECC for the award of the Rail Line Contract.
