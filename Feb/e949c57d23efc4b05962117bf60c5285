ILORIN – Yahaya Seriki, one of the strongest backers of Governor Abdulrahaman Abdulrazak, Has boldly stated that he intends to contest and win the Kwara Central Senatorial ticket at the expense of its incumbent, Dr. Yahaya Oloriegbe, who, incidentally, is also a friend and loyalist of the state governor. Seriki made this disclosure in the early hours of Wednesday at the arrival lounge of Ilorin International Airport on Wednesday after being away from the state for the last three months.“I will definitely listen to the call to contest the election in 2023. It’s a call to service and I will not let them down,” Seriki said in response to the question as to whether he will throw his hat into the ring of Senatorial electoral contest in 2023. “I will be the best senator in this country and I will not disappoint my people”, he added. Seriki was welcomed at the airport by a mammoth crowd that trailed him all the way to town. “I am seriously, actually overwhelmed because I was not expecting this,” he said, referring to the crowd. “I traveled out of the state for three months, first of its kind for me in the last 15 to 17 years. “I have not left my state for any reason, I have always been home-based. As you can see, I am deeply surprised at the volume of the crowd that came out to witness my arrival, all calling me to contest the next election,” he said.
