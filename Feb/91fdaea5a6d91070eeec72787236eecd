I am not against anybody who wants to be Governor, I will support anybody that my party produces as its Flagbearer “ “During the end of Dr. Sam Egwu administration in 2007, we argued that Power should rotate to Afikpo Block since Egwu was of Abakaliki Block, but Egwu advised that the State should go by a zonal arrangement comprising North, Central and South and he handed over Power to Central zone “ “Zoning is a product of convenience, equity, need to be your keeper, this are the things that gave birth to zoning, the closest thing to zoning in our constitution is Federal Character Principle, “I think we have reached a point where we are almost becoming slaves to zoning, integrity, competence, qualification, capacity and every other thing that should come first are being sacrificed on the Alta of zoning “ POLL “Now the three zones have enjoyed Power,people are now talking of Blocs, there is no time we met to say power will now rotate between Abakaliki and Afikpo Bloc, my worry is that somebody somewhere is either running away from doing the needful or trying to cut corners, He opined,”if PDP can not convoke a meeting and make a clear pronouncement on whether in Ebonyi State we are now doing blocs that is Afikpo or Abakaliki, or zonal arrangement where this things will be sorted out, outside this two situations, I am of the view that everybody who has capacity and thinks he could run for Governorship and win should be allowed to participate irrespective of which zone you are from.” He condemned the State Government passage of the Cybercrime (Prohibition) Law of Ebonyi State 2021 describing it as dangerous, undemocratic, and a biggest assault on democracy . “Section 8 of the Cybercrime Law says that the Police cannot prosecute anybody on account of any infringement of this Law without the Written Consent of the Attorney General, that Law was made to witch-hunt and intimidate PDP members.” Speaking against the backdrop of the Operations of Ebubeagu Security Outfit in the State, Barrister Erhenede described the outfit as anti-democratic and an infringement on the Rights and privileges of the people. 2023: PDP Accuses APC, FG Of Hiding Under Fuel Subsidy Scam To… 2023: ACF Cautions Members Against Endorsing Any Candidate “It is an anomaly that anybody is defending the operations of Ebubeagu where the State Chairman of APC is the Security Consultant and Head of Ebubeagu, what do you think will happen, would he support PDP against his own party, Ebubeagu was formed to prosecute APC Agenda in Ebonyi State.
