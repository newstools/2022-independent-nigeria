US President Joe Biden on Friday nominated federal Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson to be associate justice of the Supreme Court, the first Black woman selected to serve on the nation’s highest court. “Today, I’m pleased to nominate Judge Jackson, who will bring extraordinary qualifications, deep experience and intellect, and a rigorous traditional record to the court,” Biden said at a White House address. “Judge Jackson deserves to be confirmed as the next justice Supreme Court.” Biden picked Jackson after Justice Stephen Breyer announced his retirement in January. Jackson is a former law clerk for Breyer.

Meanwhile, Jackson in her remarks, said: “I am truly humbled by the extraordinary honor of this nomination. And I am especially grateful for the care that you have taken in discharging your Constitutional duty in service of our democracy, with all that is going on in the world today.” Jackson thanked Vice President Kamala Harris for her “invaluable role” in the nomination process. “I can only hope that my life and career, my love of this country and the Constitution, and my commitment to upholding the rule of law and the sacred principles upon which this great nation was founded, will inspire future generations of Americans,” she added. In late January, Biden said having a Black female Supreme Court justice is “long overdue,” and pledged to work with a wide assortment of individuals in making his selection, including Democratic and Republican senators, as well as scholars and lawyers and Vice President Kamala Harris.
