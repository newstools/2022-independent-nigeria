The International Air Transport Association (IATA) has said that the global air freight markets full-year demand for air cargo increased by 6.9 per cent in 2021, compared to 2019 (pre-COVID levels) and 18.7 per cent compared to 2020 following a strong performance in December 2021. This is as African airlines saw international demand grow 11.3 per cent in the 2021 compared to 2019 and a fall in international capacity of 14.6 per cent. IATA said that the growth on the African continent has been dynamic for most of the year, driven by the strength of the Africa-Asia route, adding that in December, international demand grew by 7.6 per cent year-on-year and international capacity fell 19.4 per cent.

Global demand in 2021, measured in cargo tonne-kilometers (CTKs), was up 6.9 per cent compared to 2019 (7.4 per cent for international operations). Capacity in 2021, measured in available cargo tonne-kilometers (ACTKs), was 10.9 per cent below 2019 (12.8 per cent for international operations). Capacity remains constrained with bottlenecks at key hubs. Improvements were demonstrated in December; global demand was 8.9 per cent above 2019 levels (9.4 per cent for international operations). This was a significant improvement from the 3.9 per cent increase in November and the best performance since April 2021 (11.4 per cent). Global capacity was 4.7 per cent below 2019 levels (‑6.5 per cent for international operations). POLL The lack of available capacity contributed to increased yields and revenues, providing support to airlines and some long-haul passenger services in the face of collapsed passenger revenues. In December 2021, rates were almost 150 per cent above 2019 levels. Global goods trade rose 7.7 per cent in November (latest month of data), compared to pre-crisis levels. Global industrial production was up 4 per cent over the same period.
