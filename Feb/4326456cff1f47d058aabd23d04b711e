ENUGU – As the local government elections in Enugu state draw closer, the Chairman of the State chapter of the All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA), Ndubuisi Elechionyia, has called on the State Independent Electoral Commission (ENSIEC) to ensure the conduct of a free and fair election. Elechionyia said that it is through credible, free and fair elections that competent persons will be elected as chairmen and councillors to pilot government affairs at grassroots. The APGA chairman, who stated this in an interview with Journalists on Friday in Enugu, lamented that government at the local level in the state has continued to worsen.

He blamed the development to what he describes as a monopoly enjoyed by the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, in the last 23 years, and vowed that APGA is out to challenge the narrative. Elechionyia advised the electorate to register as well as collect their Permanent Voter’s Cards, PVCs, to enable vote for their preferred candidates in the 2023 general elections.
