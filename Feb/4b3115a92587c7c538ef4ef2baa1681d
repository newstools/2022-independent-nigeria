ABAKALIKI  – Ohanaeze Ndigbo has cau­tioned desperate politicians working against the gentle­man pact of the rotational presidency between the North and South in the 2023 presidential election. Okechukwu Isiguzoro, secretary-general, Ohanaeze Ndigbo Worldwide, who stat­ed this on Monday, noted that they should be aware of the fact that changing the nar­ratives with falsehood and fallacies temporarily for in­ordinate ambition can have disastrous consequences if achieved by 2023. “North must consider the security implications of re­taining power beyond 2023 and without any options, voluntarily concede power to the South in the interest of peace and stability, except if they have decided to set the nation ablaze and sink it”.

We wish to categori­cally state that it’s Igbo’s turn to succeed President Muham­madu Buhari in 2023 and Ati­ku should reciprocate the sup­port Igbos gave him in 2019 and support one of his most trusted Igbo allies for 2023″. He said endeavors to bring another Northerner as Presi­dent in 2023 will be a disaster and it will sink Nigeria, many Southern ethnic groups will join Igbo to walk away from Nigeria as ethnic domineer­ing and intimidation will end the union. “Atiku has refused to learn from history,” he is the best President Nigeria will never have, as age and competence is the new watchword and order, to determine who will be President in 2023, and now age is not in the side of Ati­ku, he should end the ill-fated journey to Aso Rock and sup­port Ndigbo”.
