The Council of Popular and Indigenous Organizations of Honduras-COPINH, the organisation fighting for the indigenous peoples in Honduras, told the Kurdish people “We are with you” and condemned the attacks carried out by the Turkish state against every part of Kurdistan. The reaction against the attacks and the message of solidarity with the Kurdish people came from the indigenous peoples living in the Intibucá region of Esperanza, Honduras. COPINH, an organization that fights for the recognition of the political, social, cultural and economic rights of indigenous communities in Honduras and the protection of their lands, has issued a message of condemnation of the attacks carried out by the Turkish state. China Says U.S. Tariff Extension On Solar Products Hurts New… Fire Breaks Out In Russian Embassy In Manila, Employees… The statement said: “We strongly condemn the bombings carried out by Turkey. These attacks, carried out to eliminate the great resistance of the Kurdish people fighting for their freedom, are unacceptable. The simultaneous attacks by the fascist Turkish state against Rojaya, Maxmur and Shengal on the night of 1 February are unacceptable. We know that the silence of the international community is a form of complicity with the aggressors. Being silent in the face of the glorious resistance of a people whose memory is wanted to be destroyed and whose identity is denied and whose land is occupied means complicity with the hegemonic powers.” COPINH added: “We embrace the resistance of these brave people who built their freedom against the genocide carried out by the world’s greatest military powers, and we deeply feel the pain of our brothers and sisters who lost their lives in this unjust war. We salute our Kurdish comrades who are fighting for the freedom of the peoples.”
