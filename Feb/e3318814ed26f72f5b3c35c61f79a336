Zamfara Dep. Gov. Impeached, Gov. Replaces Him With Senator BREAKING: Sacked ASUU-LASU Leaders Reinstated These resolutions were passed following the adoption of a motion on the need to Investigate the Incidences of Fake Insurance Certificates in Nigeria by Hon. Oluyemi Adewale Taiwo. Hon. Taiwo noted that the Insurance Act, 2003 mandates all motorists to have a minimum of Third-Party Motor Insurance Policy in place and that Section 68 of the Act stipulates that “No person shall use or cause or permit any other person to use a motor vehicle on a road unless a liability which he may thereby incur in respect of damage to the property of third- party is insured with an Insurer registered under this Act”; The Lawmaker also said, that the statutory laws of the country stipulate that no motorist should ply Nigeria roads without having a genuine insurance certificate, however, most motorists have continued to show absolute disregard for the statutory requirement. “The House is worried that the number of vehicles with fake certificates on Nigeria roads has risen to 9.4 million and the figure released by the Nigeria Insurers Association revealed that only 2.72 million vehicles on Nigeria roads have valid insurance cover as of February 2021. “…millions of vehicles, trucks and motorcycles plying Nigeria roads are not insured.”
