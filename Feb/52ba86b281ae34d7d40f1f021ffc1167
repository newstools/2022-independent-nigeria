International Olympic Committee (IOC) presi­dent Thomas Bach will meet Chinese tennis player Peng Shuai to “convince us in person of her wellbeing and state of mind”. Bach will meet the 36-year-old during the Win­ter Olympics, which are currently being held in Beijing. Peng vanished for weeks after accusing a top Chinese official of sexual miscon­duct in November.

The IOC has spoken to Peng on video calls, and Bach said: “We know from her explanations… that she is living in Beijing that she can move freely, spend­ing time with family and friends. “Now we will be able to do the next step in a person­al meeting. We will know more about her physical integrity and mental state when we meet her in per­son. “If she wants to have an inquiry we would also sup­port her in this. But it’s her life, it’s her allegations.” The meeting will take place in the closed loop of the Games, which separates Olympics personnel from the public. POLL In November Peng post­ed a 1,600-word note on Chi­nese social media platform Weibo, accusing former Vice-Premier Zhang Gaoli of forcing her to have sex with him. She then vanished from the public eye, triggering concern among the inter­national tennis communi­ty, fans and human rights groups. She resurfaced weeks later and, in her first me­dia interview in December following her reappearance, she denied making any ac­cusations of sexual assault and claimed her social me­dia post had faced “a lot of misunderstandings”. The Women’s Tennis As­sociation (WTA) announced the suspension of all tour­naments in China in De­cember amid concerns over Peng, who is one of China’s biggest sporting stars.
