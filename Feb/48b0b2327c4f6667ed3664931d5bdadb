IBADAN  – Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU), Uni­versity of Ibadan chapter, on Tuesday stated that the union would resist the al­leged plan of the Federal Government to refuse to sign renegotiated agree­ments with the union. Rising from their congress at the University of Ibadan, presided over by the Chair­man Professor Ayo Akin­wole, they said they fully support the decision of the leadership of the union to fight for the welfare of their members whose welfare has been neglected for over 13 years. While briefing newsmen shortly after the congress, Akinwole, who was flanked by the Secretary, Dr Chris Omoregie, Dr Dapo Adewole, Dr Sarah Akintola (treasur­er) and Dr Dapo Okareh (in­ternal auditor), disclosed that the union has been pushed to the wall and would now fight back.

He stated that rather than signing the agreement, which took four years to be reached, “the Federal Government now said the agreement would now be tabled before another tripartite committee to consider it. We know this is a strategy of the Buhari ad­ministration to continue to impoverish the intellectual community.”
