He noted that youths’ participation in politics and electioneering would afford them the opportu­nity to right the perceived wrongs in society by voting in their preferred candi­dates during the elections. “The PVC is not only our right but a powerful tool for positive change of governance and politics. NYCN calls on youths who do not have PVC to quickly visit the website (https:// cvrinec.gov.ng) and register online or visit the nearest INEC office. “Imo youths must not al­low themselves to be denied the opportunity and right to actively participate in voting during the elections; now is the time to act wisely by taking advantage of the ongoing Continuous Voter Registration “, he said. He however urged the INEC to intensify public enlightenment efforts on the need for registration adding that the Nation’s youths form the highest population of voters.
