LAGOS  – A Nigerian engineer, Kolawole Olo­node, on Sunday, announced remark­able progress towards the replacement of cement in the building and construc­tion sector with agricultural wastes. Engineer Kolawole Olonade dis­closed while featuring on a popular radio programme, Sunday Morning Live FM on Ogun State radio. Engineer Olonade, who is the chair­man of the Nigerian Society of Engi­neers (NSE), Ogun State branch, said the experimentation has recorded 20% replacement for cement, just as the group is also partnering with experts from advanced countries to key into the green concrete initiative.

He charges Nigerians as the larg­est producer of cassava globally never to consider its peel as wastes, saying what is trash is a bye-product for an­other sector. Speaking forward on efforts being put in place to further develop the ini­tiative for commercial production, En­gineer Olonade explained that Germa­ny and Switzerland are collaborating with engineers in Nigeria to improve on the technology of recycling agri­cultural wastes for building and con­struction, saying cement constitutes hazards to human lives. Apart from the cost implication of cement now sold at N4,000 to N4,500 in the building and construction sector, he said it is generally dangerous to hu­man wellbeing, the environment and healthy living. He warned that the harmful effect of cement in climate change across the globe should also be considered in the built sector as it is responsible for about 8 to 10% of global Co2 emissions into the atmosphere.
