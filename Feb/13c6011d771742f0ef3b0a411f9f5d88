BENIN – An Esan social-cultural group, Esankugbe, with membership across the entire Edo Centre, has called on Ehia Olu Akhabue to join the Senate race for the Edo Central Senatorial District. A statement issued in Benin City and endorsed by the group’s Chairman and Secretary, John Itua and Moses Inegbenose respectively, and made available to newsmen, described Akhabue as a “philanthropist, whose scholarship scheme has helped and continues to help a good number of indigent children to acquire education. “Being a man for whom service to the people is a creed; a man who even as a private citizen continues to be engaged in warm-hearted humanitarian gestures, we feel encouraged to say that he is a man of the moment to represent Edo Central in the Senate,“ the statement added.

The most honourable thing for him to do now is to back down and allow fresh blood. We know he has done his best these past 8 years and we appreciate him” the statement concluded.
