A member of the House of Representatives from Iseyin/Itesiwaju/Kajola/Iwajowa federal constituency, Honourable Shina Peller, has proposed a bill praying that the House repeal the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps (Amendment) Act 2007, transfer assets and personnel of the corps to the Nigeria Police Force. Hon. Peller’s Nigeria Security And Civil Defence Corps ( Repeal and Transition) Bill 2022, which passed through first reading on Tuesday, also seeks for an establishment of a transition management committee to superintend over the NSCDC, develop regulations and implement procedures for the transfer of its assets and personnel to the Nigeria Police Force. In the proposed bill, Hon. Peller argued that fragmentation of security resources across multiple competing agencies is counterproductive, and that the mandate of the NSCDC has expanded in such a way that it has now become a duplication of the Nigeria Police Force. He argued that this has led to avoidable conflicts.

He added that the annual budget of NSCDC is almost one hundred billion naira. In addition, Hon. Peller explained that the development will not lead to loss of jobs as the assets and personnel of the NSCDC will be absorbed by the Nigeria Police.
