YAQOUB POPOOLA With the emergence of governorship  candidates for the various political parties, all seem set in the epic battle for who replaces Governor John Kayode Fayemi, at the June 18, 2022, gubernatorial poll in Ekiti State.Ekiti is unlike any other state in Nigeria, having a history of governors who served a single term, list the battle for a second-term and returning after their successor completed his term. However, the hope of Chief Segun Oni, a one-term governor coming to complete his term, inline with the precedences laid by Dr. Fayemi and Ayodele Fayose, may have been dashed after he failed to clinch his party’s ticket at the recent shadow poll.Expectedly, the two dominant political parties have commenced the show of force, each trying to outsmart the other at the ballot, by putting who they think is their best foot forward. The selection processes were not rancour-free, with both parties are now seemingly bogged down by  court processes arising from unresolved internal wranglings. It is no longer news that during the governorship primaries conducted by the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), for example, the immediate past Secretary to State Government, and one-time Chief of Staff to Governor Fayemi, Mr Biodun Abayomi Oyebanji (BAO), emerged as the standard bearer, while that of the main opposition peoples Democratic Party produced a former commissioner and state party chairman, Otunba Bisi Kolawole.Both parties are contending with litigations challenging the validity of the congresses that produced officials who organised their respective  primaries. Whether the court cases would see the light of the day, however, is story for another day. The shadow elections were equally greeted with loud complaints, as some of the aspirants who felt shortchanged alleged underhand dealings by the umpires. This development led to some of them pulling out of the races to protest the processes.For instance, seven of the APC’s eight aspirants pulled out, just as a major contender in the PDP, Senator Abiodun Olujimi, withdrew midway into the race, citing improper treatment and lopsidedness in the compilation  of the delegates list.Those who pulled out of the APC primary were Senator Michael Opeyemi Bamidele (MOB), Senator Dayo Adeyeye, Hon Femi Bamisile (BAFEM), Otunba Demola Popoola (ODEP), and Hon Bamidele Faparusi. Others are Engineer  Kayode Ojo, and Arole Oba Oluwasola.In the PDP, despite withdrawing, Kolawole garnered 671 votes to defeat his closest rival, former Governor Oni, who scored 330 votes.Other aspirants like the  former Deputy Governor, Prof Kolapo Olusola, followed with 93 votes; former House of Representatives member, Wale Aribisala had 56 votes, Kayode Adaramodu, 10 votes; former deputy governorship candidate, Deji Ogunsakin, six votes and National Assembly member, Biodun Olujimi, who had earlier pulled out of the exercise managed to secure two votes.Meanwhile, other parties have produced candidates that would battle those from the dominant two for the seat to be vacated by the incumbent governor, whose administration is in its twilight.Among them is a  former governorship aspirant under the APC, Dr Wole Oluyede, who emerged candidate of the African Democratic Party (ADP).Oyebanji, the APC candidate has been in the system since 1999 when the first progressives government was installed in Ekiti during administration of Otunba Niyi Adebayo of the Alliance for Democracy (AD), making him one of the longest serving political office holders in the state today. He served for over 11 years in various capacities, including Special Assistant (Parliamentary Affairs) to the Governor (June 1999 – July 2001), after which he became Special Adviser (Parliamentary Affairs) from August 2001– September 2002, when he was appointed Chief of Staff to the Governor, a position he held until May 29, 2003. He was Chairman, Governing Board, Citizenship and Leadership Training Centre, Federal Ministry of Youth and Sports Development, between June 2009 and December 2010; and Commissioner, Ministry of Integration and Inter-Governmental Affairs, Ekiti State from then till December 2011.Oyebanji  was Head, Office of Transformation Strategy and Delivery (OTSD), Ekiti State (December 2011 –January 2013); Commissioner, Ministry of Budget, Economic Planning and Service Delivery, from January 2013 – October 2014; and Secretary to the State Government, October 2018 – December 2021. He has been engaged in Agribusiness for over two decades and is the chairman of Con Dois Farms Limited.Accepting to fly the APC flag, Oyebanji dedicated his victory to the Ekiti people, the party and participatory democracy. For the former chief of Staff and Governor Fayemi’s former SSG, “as we begin the task of campaigning for the Saturday, June 18, 2022 election, we have a huge mission ahead of us to retain the governance of our dear state under our great party, and to ensure the continuity of our progressive programmes and policies as established by our leaders.”He appreciated the good fight put up by fellow aspirants, who he described as “worthy Ekiti sons,” for what he described as their “courage of conviction and passion for the upliftment of our dear State.”Your participation in the process has served to strengthen our party, through the mobilisation of many voices.”During contests such as this, tensions are understandably high, and tempers rise in all quarters. This is all normal in the course of democratic expression. I hereby promise my fellow aspirants that together, we will work towards victory and a bright future for our people.”He promised to personally seek audience with his fellow aspirants ahead of the main election, listen to them, “so that together we can fit in our respective parts of the big picture and run a  wholesome campaign that connects with the hearts and minds of our people,” he stressed.Kolawole on the hand was a member of the Ekiti State  House of Assembly from 2010 to 2014, when he was appointed Commissioner for Environment (2014-2018), and later Ekiti State Chairman of the PDP. He served as Director-General of Prince Adedayo Adeyeye Movement (PAAM) in 2014.The two standard bearers have many things in common in their political journeys. It is not hidden that  Oyebanji is very close to two political leaders in Ekiti- Governor Fayemi and former Governor Adebayo, now Minister of Trade, Industry and Investments, with who he enjoys a cordial relationship. Indeed, both leaders are known to have endorsed and worked for his emergence, and by extension, literarily inherit their political  structures.Oyebanji hopes to leverage on Fayemi’s influence at the centre, while mobilizing the people and resources to prosecute the election.Kolawole, on the hand, also served two administrations- Chief Oni and Fayose, but unlike Oyebanji, he may not enjoy the support of the duo, with Oni now feeling shortchanged. Having his party at the centre would also make things easy for Oyebanji as there may be enough political patronage to dangle at aggrieved member of the party, at least for the remaining months to the May 29, 2023 handover date of the Muhammadu Buhari government.One other factor expected to work for the APC is the assurance by the seven  aggrieved aspirants not to leave the party ahead of the poll. However, not leaving the party may not necessarily translate to not working against her at the poll. Their decision could also be a plus for Oyebanji, if he take advantage of prompt and far-reaching reconciliatory mechanism. If Oyebanji has such assurances, Kolawole did not as of the time of going to press. Indeed, some of the aggrieved aspirants have threatened to rock his boat. In particular, Oni seemed poised for a showdown with the PDP.If Oni’s camp eventually pulls out of the party, there is a likelihood that such move would adversely effect Kolawole chances at the poll, unless a miracle happens fast.Also noteworthy is Senator Olujimi’s outburst after the primaries that shows clearly her not being favourably disposed to working for a Kolawole victory. She currently meeting her supporters across the 16 Local Governments to chart a new course.Already, some PDP stalwarts are insinuating that Fayose’s alleged  romance with the ruling APC  was to undermine the party’s victory at the poll. They also see Kolawole as a  “duplicate” of the APC candidate. But Kolawole in an acceptance speech described his emergence as a divine arrangement, even as he described the result as very clear, the process very clear, credible, leaving “everybody happy.”…It has pleased God to make me the winner of the election, I willingly accept to be the flagbearer of our great party.”Oni, who had conceded defeat  to Kolawole at the venue of the primaries later faulted the process that produce the PDP Flagbearer.While accepting the shadow election outcome, he had promised that “we are going to fight together to make him (Kolawole) governor. We are satisfied with the process and no one is complaining. You saw it all here.”Insinuation was rife that Oni may dump the PDP for another party in pursuance of his aspiration complete his final term. However, while faulting the process later, Chief Oni in a statement by the Director-General of his campaign organisation, Hon. Yemi Arokodare maintained that the outcome of the alleged “flawed” PDP governorship primary in Ekiti was orchestrated by Fayose to sell the party to the ruling APC.”For the record, Ekiti is a giveaway to the APC; the majority of party members are aware that it would be an exercise in futility to spend time and resources to campaign for the candidate of the PDP ahead of the June 18 election.”It is a big shame that the National Working Committee of the PDP could not see through this deception, but deliberately connived with Fayose to force Governor Udom Emmanuel on the Ekiti process to achieve a predetermined hatchet job. “The National Chairman of the PDP, Sen. Iyorchia Ayu should explain to party members nationwide the import of Section 45 (a) Part VI under the General Provisions of the Electoral Guidelines for Primary after the ad-hoc election was nullified”.Section 45 a, according to Oni states that: “Any officer or member of the party who fails, refuses or neglects to carry out his duties about these guidelines on the general conduct of the primary elections or who obstructs, defies, or in any manner hinders, impedes or subverts the implementation, or success of these guidelines is guilty of gross misconduct and shall be brought before the National Disciplinary Committee of the party for disciplinary action.”Going by the foregoing provision, Oni challenged Ayu to explain why he allowed Governor Emmanuel to come for the second exercise in Ekiti after midwifing the process for the botched ad-hoc delegates election that was nullified.Oni expressed disgust that the PDP Appeal Panel hurriedly sat to ratify a fraudulent election without looking into the merits of the petition written by one of the aspirants, Mrs Deborah Alo. “It is worrisome that Chairman Ayu is interested in threatening party members with suspension and expulsion, but he is hardly interested in how the party will win in Ekiti,” Oni said.He also alleged that with the wobbling and bleak future that awaits the party in Ekiti, her candidate and Fayose’s protege, is a duplicate copy of the APC’s candidate in the June 18 governorship election.“Chairman Ayu must tell the world why he cannot trust any other PDP governor except Gov Emmanuel to conduct the two exercises in Ekiti State, when it is evident that Fayose had conducted Gov Udom’s 2019 Primaries. “It is now crystal clear that the plot ab initio was for the two buddies of Fayose from Akwa Ibom State, Emmanuel Enoidem (former Legal Adviser of the PDP) and Gov Udom Emmanuel, to conduct the two exercises in favour of Fayose, and the NWC fell for it. “Chairman Ayu deliberately indulged Fayose who attempted to truncate the national convention that produced the current NWC, and never asked him how he intended to win Ekiti for the PDP with the weakest of the aspirants, even when he could not do so as a sitting governor with his deputy in 2018.In all of these, Fayose is seemingly pursuing his agenda, insisting that he would not stop those who feel their political aspiration cannot be achieved in the PDP from leaving  the party. In a statement he personally signed by him and distributed on Sunday Fayose said “it is a matter of choice and commitment to one’s personal ambition, or the interests of the PDP.”Justifying his support for the PDP candidate, Fayose said “it’s not anti-party or outside any party member’s right to support any aspirant of his or her choice in a build up to a primary election, and same cannot be used against anyone after the process.”He said part of protection of interests of stakeholders was the appointment of Otunba Yinka Akerele, an aspirant from the Repositioning Group within the PDP as Director-General of the campaign, adding that “this is the beginning of the process to ensure that all interests are duly taken care of.”For him, therefore, “what else can I ask for, after winning for my candidate? Therefore, my duty is to provide leadership for all and the party at large and ensure that all interests are protected as politics is purely interest based to which I will never be insensitive.”He, however, promised as leader of the party, he “will be magnanimous, equitable and work with all without bitterness. This I say with all sense of responsibility. Therefore, come let’s win together.” Those who know insist a lot more work needs to be done, for the PDP to avoid a humiliating defeat come June 18.
