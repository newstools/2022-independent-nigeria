29-year-old Inter defensive midfielder Marcelo Brozovic is yet to renew his contract at Giuseppe Meazza, making his presence in Simone Inzaghi’s squad next summer highly doubtful. There have so far been shaky developments in the negotiations for his contract that expires at the end of the season. The former Dinamo Zagreb midfielder has been the subject of transfer interest from top clubs, especially Barcelona and Tottenham Hotspur, with the former still interested in his services on a bosman transfer. Despite talks being held over a potential contract extension last month, Brozovic was approached by Antonio Conte’s Tottenham at the end of the January window. However, the Italian tactician’s desire to reunite with his former soldier failed to materialize, as the North London giants made peace with the signings od Dejan Kulusevski and Rodrigo Bentancur.

They are willing to offer Brozovic €8m net per season, making him one of the highest earners at the club. Contrasting reports from Italy, from La Gazzetta dello Sport (via SempreInter) dictate that it seems likely that the midfielder will remain in Lombardy as the season approaches its end, after initially rejecting Inter’s offer to sign a renewed contract. He is currently one of the Nerazzurri’s most significant players in the middle of the park. He moved to Inter in 2015 and has since been the club’s midfield mainstay, going on to score 25 goals in 271 appearances so far.
