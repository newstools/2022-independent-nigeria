Libya’s parliament on Thursday said it had “unanimously approved” a new prime minister, in a challenge to the war-torn country’s interim government. Parliament speaker Aguila Saleh said former Interior Minister Fathi Bashaga had been tipped to head the government. Recall that Libya has not had a stable government since former ruler Moammar Gadhafi was toppled in 2011. Since then, ongoing power struggles between rival political factions have kept the country in chaos.

Interim Premier Abdul Hamid Dbeibah’s Government of National Unity was set up by a UN-brokered process in February 2021 intended to keep a government in place until elections can be held. However, Dbeibah’s interim government based in Tripoli does not have the support of the parliament based in eastern Libya, which seeks to replace the interim premier and assume power. The parliament has argued that Dbeibah’s mandate ended after the failed election in December. On Wednesday, hundreds took to the streets of Tripoli protest the parliament’s decision to name a new premier. POLL SOURCE: DW.COM
