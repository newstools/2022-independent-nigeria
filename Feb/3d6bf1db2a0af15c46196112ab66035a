Following the increase in killing of humans for purported money rituals across the nation, the Nigeria Police Force has said there is nothing like money ritual and has warned Nigerians to stop killing fellow human beings. The Ogun State Police Public Relations Officer, Abimbola Oyeyemi, who spoke at the Ogun State police headquarters, Eleweran, Abeokuta said no money could come through the killing of fellow human beings. Oyeyemi, who described as worrisome, the increasing rate of ritual killing in Ogun and Nigeria, called on well-meaning individuals to join hands in putting an end to the menace.

Oyeyemi said, “It is becoming worrisome, the rate at which some disgruntled elements are killing their fellow human beings for money-making rituals. It is something that all well-meaning Nigerians should have to put all hands on deck to checkmate. “This is the height of man’s inhumanity to man. It is the superlative degree of animalistic behaviour. There is nothing like money-making ritual. It is barbaric, it is despicable and it is not acceptable.” He however charged parents to warn their children, urging adults and anyone aiding and abetting the crime to stop henceforth as the hand of the law will catch up with those perpetrating the evil.
