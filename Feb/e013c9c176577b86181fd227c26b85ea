As the contest for the governorship seat of Abia State in 2023 begins to gather momentum, the Ikwuano Stakeholders Forum (ISF) has dissociated itself from a communiqué currently circulating in the social media zoning governorship seat to Abia North. It argued that contrary to the contents of the communiqué, the issue of zoning of Abia governorship position was not mentioned at a meeting of Ikwuano/Umuahia Forum held recently. Briefing newsmen in Umahia on Monday, the chairman of the stakeholder forum, Rear Admiral Ralph Osondu explained that the issue of zoning of the Abai governorship seat was mentioned in the meeting because “it is the exclusive prerogative of the party (PDP) and therefore, not part of the motions moved, supported and adopted during the meeting”. According to him, “in respect of that meeting, no communiqué has, so far, been released officially by the Ikwuano/Umuahia Forum”, adding that any communiqué, being circulated and containing the support for zoning of governorship position to any zone does not have the endorsement of Ikwuano PDP Stakeholders. “We, the PDP Stakeholders of Ikwuano do hereby state as follows: that Ikwuano PDP Stakeholders hereby strongly dissociate itself from the obnoxious communiqué in circulation. “That the good people of Ikwuano are loyal to the party and will continue to support our great party, the PDP under the leadership of the Executive Governor, Okezie Ikpeazu PhD, to win convincingly in all elections come 2023”. Flanked by other leaders from Ikwuano like Hon Wisdom Ogbonna, Hon Clement Onukwue, Chief BC Mgbaramuko, Chief Chinkwe Ndimele, Pastor Ekeleme Ikeije, the secretary of the forum, the Ikwuano Stakeholders pledged their continued support to the PDP led by Governor Okezie Ikpeazu and assured him of their readiness to win all positions in 2023.
