In a statement posted on Instagram, Henderson wrote: “Can’t believe I’m having to do this but I’d just like to address the rumours that have come to light in the last couple of days. “There are some sad people in the world that have attached my name to such inappropriate, hurtful and totally false news stories. “I have a family who have even affected by this so wanted to put the rumours to bed and move on.” Henderson joined Manchester United from Carlisle United as a 14-year-old for an undisclosed fee. POLL The England international has risen through the ranks at Old Trafford to make a total of 29 appearances for the club. However, he is currently playing second-fiddle to current no.1 David de Gea, with his last appearance coming in the penalty shootout defeat to Middlesbrough in the FA Cup earlier in February. He has not featured in a Premier League match this term due to the excellent form of the Spaniard. It’s understood Henderson was keen on a transfer away from the club in January, but interim boss Ralf Rangnick confirmed the club blocked a move from Old Trafford.
