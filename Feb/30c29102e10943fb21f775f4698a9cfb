LAGOS – President of the Nigeria Judo Federation (NJF), Dr. Musa Oshodi has called on Nigerians, especially corporate organizations to support the federation in their quest to reposition and take the sport of judo to the next level.Recalling with nostalgia how Nigerian judo vanished from the international radar, Oshodi said “For a country that produced African champions, Commonwealth champions, and one of the best judokas in the world to have failed to qualify for three consecutive Olympic Games, is a sad commentary on the state of affairs in our sports. But the good news today is that the narrative has changed.”For the first time in its almost 50 years of history, the NJF got a judoka as it’s president courtesy of the last federation elections in Abuja.”I want to call on Nigerians especially the corporate organisations to support us to take judo to its enviable heights in Nigeria,”.On the forthcoming national trials for the Commonwealth Games billed for Lagos from February 22 to 25, Oshodi said that all hands would be on deck for the federation to pick the best judokas for the Commonwealth Games.He warned that gone are the days when list of Nigerian judokas for international competitions would be compiled by officials without national trials.”We want to do things differently from now on. Any judokas who fail to show up for the national trials which hold in Lagos should forget being on the list of those going to the Commonwealth Games. “No matter how highly ranked the judokas might be, they must come for the trials to show the world how good they are.”We want to be transparent to give Nigeria quality representation at the Commonwealth Games,””Apart from providing a formidable Team which will represent Nigeria at the Commonwealth Games in Birmingham in the United Kingdom from July 28th to August 8th, 2022, the trials will also herald the new dispensation in Nigerian judo,” Oshodi said.He said the NJF will present about 300 judokas from 36 states and the FCT Abuja for the Road to Birmingham Trials in Lagos, adding that a Local Organizing Committee (LOC) headed by the vice president of the NJF, Mrs. Loveth Howell will organise the Lagos trials.
