P/HARCOURT – Senator Magnus Ngei Abe, former representative of Rivers South-East at the Na­tional Assembly, has appealed to Senator Bennett Birabi to treat his fellow Ogonis with respect and avoid going to the public space to tear them down. Abe, who made the appeal in a statement posted on his official Facebook Page titled: ‘We Are Not Minions’, said: “When we do that, we give credibility to those who see disunity in Ogoni as our big­gest challenge.” He maintained that what Ogoni needs now more than ever before is goodwill from Rivers people across the spec­trum, therefore, “our words and actions should promote friendship and love across board, within and outside Ogoni, if we really want the integration of the Ogoni Peo­ple.” NiMET Warns Of Extreme Heats As Temperature Rises Across States Yobe Commends AFRYDEV For Training GBV Survivors The senator stated that the derogatory reference to other Ogonis by one of their own was too painful to ignore and wondered why Senator Birabi would describe Ogonis who served in the Rivers State Government or support the governors as ‘minions’.
