Formula 1 has announced that The Circuit of the Americas in Austin will remain the home of the United States Grand Prix for the next five years, or until 2026. COTA, which hosted its first F1 race in 2012, will reside on Grand Prix racing’s calendar alongside the Miami Grand Prix that will make its debut in May and which holds a ten-year contract with Formula One Management. The news validates the current momentum enjoyed by Formula 1 in America where a record-breaking 400,000 race fans traveled to COTA last October to witness the sport’s return to the country after a two-year hiatus due to the Covid-19 pandemic.
