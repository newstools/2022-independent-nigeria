Abuja – Federal High Court Abuja, presided over by Justice Inyang Eden Ekwo has fixed March 25 for judgment in a suit by the 36 States governments against Federal Government’s move to deduct $418m from States’ funds to settle debts owed consultants engaged by the States and Local Governments in relation to the Paris Club refunds. Justice Ekwo fixed the date on Tuesday, various counsel to parties had adopted their final written addresses. By the suit marked: FHC/ ABJ/CS/1313/2021, the plaintiffs are seeking an order to restrain President Muhammadu Buhari and others from effecting the planned deduction from States’ funds to settle the debt owed consultants. Lead plaintiffs’ lawyer, Sunday Ameh SAN, in his final submission, submitted that the defendants misconstrued the kernel of his clients’ suit. Ameh faulted the argument by the defendants that the suit was challenging existing judgments given by the court in favour of some of the consultants. “We are not challenging the judgments, we are saying the way the Federal Government and its agencies are going about enforcing the judgments violates sections 120 and 162 of the Constitution. Defendants’ lawyers, including Wole Olanipekun SAN, Maimuna Lami Shiru (acting Director, Civil Litigation, Federal Ministry of Justice) and Olusola Oke SAN, all faulted the competence of the suit and urged the court to dismiss it.
