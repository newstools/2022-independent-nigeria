Russia’s civil aviation authority has banned UK flights to and over Russia in retaliation for the British ban on Aeroflot. Russia’s Federal Agency for Air Transport (Rosaviatsiya) said that all flights by British carriers to Russia – as well as transit flights – are banned starting today (Friday). It said the measure was taken in response to the “unfriendly decisions” by the British authorities who banned flights to the UK by the Russian flag carrier Aeroflot as part of sanctions over Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.
