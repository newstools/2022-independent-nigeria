Rev. Idy James of United Evangelical Church (founded as Qua Iboe Church), Surulere, Lagos, has called for continuous prayer for Nigeria for a positive turnaround. James noted that Nigerians should not give up but walk in love, peace, righteousness and faith. The preacher made the plea while speaking with journalists at the church’s ‘7 Great Sundays 2022’ which started January 2nd and ends today Sunday, February, 13. Hope Renewed At INL 12th Thanksgiving Service Nigeria Can’t Progress Without Restorative Justice – BSN… His words: “By the grace of God as a servant of God all hope is not lost, God is still in control as he spoke to us in the service and even now we believe that no matter the ugly situation in the nation God has the power to turn things around for our good. “This is why we need to be praying continuously. I believe with the prayers of the believers God will surely have mercy on us as a nation; in the days of Ezekiel there were issues in the land and God was looking for just one person that would stand in the gap and unfortunately he found nobody but in this generation many people are there who are standing in the gap as believers in the Lord. “So we have the hope that as we pray into God, He knows how to open the floodgates of heaven, He knows what to do to take us to another level. By the grace of God I also believe all hope is not lost because God is truly in charge of this situation.” James, host of the seven great Sunday themed; ‘You Shall See His Glory’, extracted from John 11 verse 40, said the programme was to further bring to manifestation the efficacy of God’s power in turning the tide for good, stressing that the place of God’s glory in individual lives, that of the Church and nation cannot be over emphasised. He added that part of the clerics who ministered were Rev. Obinna Rapheka Mbadugha, Rev. (Dr.) Unyime Ukoete, Dr. Dennis Inyang and Rev. Samuel Ebukiba.
