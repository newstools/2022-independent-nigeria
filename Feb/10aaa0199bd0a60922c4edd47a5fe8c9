Dr. Kechi F. Ogbuagu, the President/Founder, C4C, in his remarks, said: “Our dream as Conversations for Change is to see every young person in Nigeria, in Sub-Saharan Africa, and the world at large, living his or her best life – with a sustainable means of livelihood and financially empowered. They will thus contribute to the economy and become relevant and influential members of the society and become key players in the areas of entrepreneurship, leadership and governance. “The role the entrepreneurs play in economic development cannot be overemphasised, neither can the importance of social entrepreneurship be overstated. While entrepreneurship may create a source of livelihood for a creative entrepreneur, social entrepreneurship has the power to change the life of not just one creative entrepreneur, but the lives and living conditions of an entire community. “Our aim, therefore, is to inspire and provide as many young people as possible with the skills required for becoming successful social entrepreneurs.”
