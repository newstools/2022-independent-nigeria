There was a time when the duo of Ituah Ighodalo and Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu were like peas in a pod. Then, Ighodalo was once one of the prominent faces who stepped out with Tinubu for important visitations. At that time, many wondered if the Senior Pastor and founder of Trinity House was taking a liking for politics, and was seeking the face of the former Lagos State Governor for approval. Governor Dapo Abiodun, Ooni Of Ife, Others To Honour Late Oba… Like Sayyu Dantata, Like Wale Tinubu These days, the situation has changed as the long-time friends appear to have fallen out. Ighodalo’s recent comments about his old friend’s presidential ambition come 2023 has been less than inspiring, as he has been quoted saying that Nigeria does not need a president like Asiwaju Tinubu because the National Leader of the All Progressive Congress (APC), is only ambitious and not hungry to serve Nigerians. The pastor called for a leader who has something to offer the people, a person who knows where he is taking the nation to and one who has the interest of the people at heart, adding that Tinubu should be more focused on how to select a person who will be able to take the country forward.
