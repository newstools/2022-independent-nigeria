The group spoke on the grounds of recent arrests of drug cartels at airports, seaports and other high places in the country. “We must commend the Chairman and Chief Executive of the NDLEA for his exploits in the fight against drug cartels. We know his doggedness has made the success so far possible, we can only wish him more successes in the fight to sanitise our society and make it a drug free one. “Just like the saying, ‘the reward of hard work is more work’, we implore the Executive Director not to relent in his effort, because the cartels can re-strategize to launch their sinister moves again.” “Finally, we wish to enjoin all other relevant agencies of government to take a cue from the gallantry being put to use by Brig. Gen Marwa, as we promise to continue to support the agency in the fight against illegal drugs,” Soloki added.
