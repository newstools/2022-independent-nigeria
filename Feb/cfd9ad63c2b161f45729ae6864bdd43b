Diogo Dalot is in line to extend his stay at Manchester United – leaving Aaron Wan-Bissaka’s future in serious doubt. The £19 million Portuguese ace, 22, has made the right-back position his own in recent weeks after winning his first-team battle against ex-England Under 21 international Wan-Bissaka. Dalot has 15 months left on his present deal but the club have an option to trigger an additional year. Lampard Frustrated By Players’ Mentality, Inconsistency Clinical Kane Throws Liverpool Title Lifeline With Dramatic… And the Reds have decided already to exercise that clause in order to protect themselves against any cut-price offers in the close season. Both AC Milan, where he spent last term on loan, and German club Borussia Dortmund failed with bids to sign the ex-Porto starlet last summer. Should Dalot continue to impress under interim boss Ralf Rangnick, United will be keen to open talks over an improved new deal – in order to tie him down long-term. All of which is creating more uncertainty for troubled Wan-Bissaka as he struggles to earn the trust of the Reds’ German coach. With only 15 Premier League appearances this season, the ex-Crystal Palace man, a £50m buy in July 2019, has been unable to regain his first-team place due to Dalot’s superb form. POLL Despite recovering from an illness that ruled him out for a fortnight last month, Wan-Bissaka, 24, has not featured at all since the 1-0 home Premier League defeat to Wolves on Jan 3. He will have two years remaining on his contract at the end of the campaign and United might opt to move him on – depending on what happens in the managerial hot-seat. But if they do want to sell, they know they will not get anything close to the fee that made Wan-Bissaka the most-expensive uncapped England player in history. Three years on, he is still waiting for that elusive first senior international appearance. Dalot, by contrast, made his full debut for Portugal at the Euros and now has a total of four caps.
