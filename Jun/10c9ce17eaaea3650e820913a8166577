Nigeria’s super talented Afrobeats singer, Olaniyan Omotayo Paul, popularly known as Glictocom, has revealed why it took him a while before finally taking the bold step to release his latest collection of works. Recall that Glictocom has released a couple of super tunes that have really done well in the music space, with critics citing the efficiency of Glictocom’s craft and prowess. The new body of work marks his first music album and it consists of four tracks and bonus instrumentals. The tracks include ‘Forget’; ‘Gender’; ‘Harder’; and ‘Important’. -Advertisement- Glictocom, while commenting on the debut album revealed that he took him a while to be able to get the job done because he wanted his own sound and a body of work that will be able to stand the test of time. “I deliberately took my time to work on myself and make sure I get my sound right before releasing this project. I ought to have released it last year but I wasn’t sure it was going to be my best. But I’m confident music lovers now have great music at their disposal.” He, however, promised that he would soon release visuals to a few songs from the EP while hoping that the new project will open doors for him and expand his music tentacles as he plans to drop a proper album next year.
