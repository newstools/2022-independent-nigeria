Reno Omokri, a former media aide to ex-President Goodluck Jonathan, has said APC presidential aspirant Bola Tinubu, has no moral justification to complain if President Muhammadu Buhari picks his successor. According to Omokri, though “it’s treason for Buhari to singlehandedly pick his successor,” Tinubu had no moral ground to complain. He noted that Buhari should allow Nigerians decide who succeeds him in 2023. -Advertisement- Reno tweeted, “It is wrong for Buhari to singlehandedly pick the presidential candidate of the APC. “But Tinubu has no moral grounds to complain about that. However, it is treasonable for Buhari to say he will pick his successor. Nigerians will pick his successor. “If Buhari’s threat to produce his successor is predicated on repeating (what happened) 2019, my response to him is to repeat what he said on May 15, 2012: ‘They either conduct a free and fair election or they go a very disgraceful way’.” Recall that a few days ago, Buhari had urged APC governors to allow him pick his successor.
