 Food And Beverage West Africa (FABWA), the largest F And B TradeShow across sub-Saharan Africa, will return to Lagos in two weeks’ time. Running from Tuesday, June 14 to Thursday, June 16, 2022, at the Landmark Centre on Victoria Island, FAB West Africa has more than 220 exhibitors from five continents participating. -Advertisement- Such has been the demand for the show the organisers have needed to expand the floor space, meaning FAB West Africa will be the biggest food and beverage fair to ever take place on the Nigerian soil. While having an international flavour, the event will place a real focus on promoting Nigerian food and beverage products. Gold sponsors are Just Food West Africa, Daffy and Nasco. But with more than 40 countries represented, visitors will have an opportunity to find out about the latest local and international food and drink developments and to sample products being launched in Nigeria and the region.
