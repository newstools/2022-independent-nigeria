Ahead of the presidential primaries of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), the apex Igbo socio-cultural organization, Ohanaeze Ndigbo has called on President Muhammadu Buhari to consider the South-East zone for the number one seat to avert a possible fallout in the party’s National Convention. The Secretary-General of Ohanaeze, Mazi Okechukwu Isiguzoro who made the call in a statement issued on Monday told President Buhari to remember his conversation with the late Biafra warlord, Odumegu Ojukwu, and consider a southeast Presidency. Speaking after a series of meetings held with relevant stakeholders in Abakaliki, Ebonyi State, the Igbo group, however, said choosing a candidate who might not be a solution to the threats against the unity of the country should be discarded. -Advertisement- The statement read, “In search of unity of the country, APC should consider Southeast, we can not afford to play into the hands of Biafra agitators, President Buhari should remember the conversation he had with the Igbo legend, Dim Odumegwu Ojukwu and consider southeast Presidency. “We are looking forward to the President standing firm and saving the unity of the country is of paramount importance, we are optimistic that considering the Southeast will save Nigeria from chaos as there are ongoing silent wars in the Southeast. “We cannot guarantee peace, especially if we play into the hands of the proponents of Biafra agitation, only a wise decision will save the country’s unity. “APC should opt for a consensus rather than a fierce contest to avert implosion and strengthen internal Democracy in the ruling party” Ndigbo urges the President to use the strategy for the emergency of APC National Chairman Senator Adamu to resolve the tensions and anxiety associated with APC primaries and do the needful. “What is needed now is the consideration of security implications if southeast Presidency is not achieved in APC, the conspiracy against the Southeast with a wrong choice will spell doom for Nigeria.”
