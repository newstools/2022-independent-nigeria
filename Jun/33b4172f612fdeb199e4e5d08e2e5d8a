LAGOS – A total number of two thousand, two hundred and three (2,203) accredited delegates are set to vote at the ongoing Presidential primaries of the ruling party, All Progressives Congress, APC. This is coming on the heels of President Muhammadu Buhari’s presidential remarks, shortly after twenty two out of the twenty three aspirants had given their manifestoes. Hopefully, it is expected that the party would hold a free, fair and peaceful presidential primary.
