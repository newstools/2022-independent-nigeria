ABUJA – The President, Helpline Foundation for the Needy, Dr. Jumai Ahmadu, has called on the Federal Government to ensure the rights of widows are enshrined in international law. While calling on relevant authorities to take the plight of widows seriously as they are passing through hardship of different kinds. Ahmadu said Federal Government should ensure compliance with the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women and the Convention on the Rights of the Child. She made the submissions in her message to 370 widows who were undergoing numerous skills acquisition programme to commemorate the International Widows’ Day on Thursday in Abuja. She said part of her contribution to the lives of the widows is to empower 370 to enhance their livelihoods and improve their confidence to face the future with their children. Ahmadu who was represented by the Programme Coordinator, Mr. Onoja Arome, urged widows to remain calm and law-abiding and not to contribute negatively to the status already subsisting. She said careful approach should be maintained when clamouring for their rights with late husband’s properties as laws are available to women in such circumstances. She said, “Widows are among other groups in the society that are most marginalised, denied access to common patrimonies of their husbands, social and sexual abuse in some instances and most experience violence.” -Advertisement- POLL “We therefore call the attention of all relevant authorities to take the plight of this group of people seriously as they may be passing through hardship of different kinds. We must raise platforms for “Sustainable solutions for widows’ financial independence” as this year’s theme implies.”
