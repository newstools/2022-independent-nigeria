P/HARCOURT  – The Rivers state government has been urged to create a marketing board for the management of various markets across the state for proper documentation and control. Frontline activist Dr. Sokari Soberekon who called for the establishment of a State Market Management Board (RSMMB) for the management of the various markets in the state said the creation of the board will enhance effective management and development of markets in all 23 local government areas in the state. The ‘Senior Advocate of the Niger Delta (SAND)’ who made the call while speaking to journalists in Port Harcourt, also wants the establishment of the board backed by relevant laws. Sokari, known for his roles in the establishment of the Oil Derivation Formula in the regime of late Shehu Shagari in 1981, said, “Creating the RSMMB and appointing capable hands to oversee it will result in effective and efficient administration and management of the markets that will bring more development to the state and creation of jobs to the ever increasing population of the state”. Sokari appealed to the Rivers State governor to allocate the new Mile 1 Market to the various local governments in the state through the proposed RSMMB while the old one should be allocated to Port Harcourt City Local Government. He also pleaded with the governor to reactivate the old River State Main Market in Aggrey/Harbour Road around the Police Children School, and hand it over to the board when established, for proper management. “The Police Children School should be relocated to a larger space”, he suggested, adding that rebuilding the Rivers State Old Market would reduce hawking and street trading in the area.”
