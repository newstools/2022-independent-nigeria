LAGOS – A Chieftain of All Progressives Congress (APC), Hon. Adesina Egbetokun has pleaded for Nigerians to cast their votes  for the APC Presidential candidate, Senator Bola Ahmed Tinubu to save the nation from total collapse come the 2023 general elections. Egbetokun who was an aspirant for Alimosho Federal House of Representatives in the recent APC primary elections but later stepped down for the party choice, Hon. Barr. Ganiyu Adele Ayuba said there is no better person among the presidential candidates than Asiwsju Tinubu who God has ordained to save Nigeria from its ruin. The frontline politician said Nigeria need a brilliant, humanitarian and generous politician like Asiwaju Bola Tinubu to save the nation from its economic decay. The business guru cum politician further added that over the years he has been looking for a credible and competent presidential candidate, who could make a difference at the national level. He noted that most of the people who had been elected to govern the country had failed and their performances were below expectations. He said he’s convinced that going by what Tinubu was able to achieve in Lagos State as a governor, if he’s given the opportunity and elected as the next president of Nigeria, he would surely perform even better than what he did in Lagos State. Egbetokun admonished Nigerians not to miss this great opportunity of having Tinubu as their next president.
