Rafael Nadal defeated Casper Ruud 6-3, 6-3, 6-0 in the men’s 2022 French Open singles final Sunday, extending his record to 22 Grand Slam titles. Nadal remains undefeated in 14 championship matches at Roland Garros, becoming the oldest men’s winner ever at the tournament. The Norwegian Ruud, 23, had never made it past the fourth round of a Grand Slam before his run in Paris this year. Nadal won the last 11 straight games of the final to cruise to the win. The King of Clay has only lost three matches ever at the French Open — he’s now 112-3 — two of them to Novak Djokovic, who he defeated in a marathon quarterfinal matchup this year. Nadal advanced to the final after Alexander Zverev retired from their tightly-contested semifinal in the second set with an injury. -Advertisement- Nadal, who turned 36 on Friday, indicated last Sunday that this French Open could be his last. “Every match that I play here, I don’t know if it’s going to be my last match here in Roland Garros in my tennis career, no? That’s my situation now,” he said. His record 21st Grand Slam title came earlier this year at the Australian Open. The back-to-back wins mark the first time in Nadal’s career that he’s won the first two Grand Slams of the year. After winning his first Australian Open in 2009, he lost to Robin Soderling in the fourth round in Paris.
