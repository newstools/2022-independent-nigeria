Disturbed by the obvious absence and consequences of the Coastal and Water­ways Development Com­mission of Nigeria, the president of the Associa­tion of Coastal and Water­ways Communities of Ni­geria (ACWCN), Comrade Bawo Ighomi has called on the Presidency to cre­ate now the Ministry of Coastal and Waterways Development Commission of Nigeria (NCWDCN), in­sisting that this is the only solution to the challenges the Association of Coastal and Waterways Communi­ties of Nigeria (ACWCN) is facing and battling cur­rently. “Today, we are battling under development in geo­graphical terrain in Nige­ria. I want to inform the Presidency that most of the inhabitants of Costal and Waterways areas in Niger Delta region, don’t have access of bridge link­ing the city centers, mean­ing that they have been pitiably cut off from the development of all sorts. To worsen this matter, no common drinkable water, these communities are also suffering absence of health care facilities, poor housing conditions, lack of electricity is obviously lacking in their environ­ment. The worst of these matters, is the physically challenging massive ero­sion cases, flooding and environmental pollution, total distraction of their ecology and many other unnamed challenges too many to mention for now, have turned lives and liv­ing to a nightmare for the unfortunate inhabitants of the concerned areas”, he submitted. Ighomi, who feels se­riously concerned over these challenges, strongly believed that if the Minis­try of Coastal and Water­ways Development Com­mission is created now as suggested, “it will give the concerned Coastal and Waterways Development Commission the golden opportunities to develop side by side with the city centers and by so doing, put a check on the level of migration of Coastal and Waterways Commu­nities to the cities, the es­tablishment of the cottage industries would no doubt generate employment as a result”.
