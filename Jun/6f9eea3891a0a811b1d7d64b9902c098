Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer’s name appeared on a hit list kept by a man who allegedly fatally shot a retired Wisconsin judge on Friday, the governor’s office said on Saturday. “Yesterday our office was notified by law enforcement officials that Governor Whitmer’s name appeared on the Wisconsin gunman’s list,” a spokesman for Whitmer told Reuters. “While the news reports are deeply troubling, we will not comment further on an ongoing criminal investigation,” he added. -Advertisement- The Wisconsin Department of Justice said the retired judge, John Roemer, 68, was found dead on Friday in his home after the local sheriff’s office received a call about “an armed person and two shots fired in a Township of New Lisbon residence.” The department called it a “targeted” attack. It said that Douglas Uhde, 56, was found in the basement of Roemer’s home with an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound. A firearm was recovered at the scene. The department said Uhde remains in critical condition at a medical facility. “This … does appear to be a targeted act and the individual who is a suspect appears to have had other targets as well. It appears to be related to the judicial system,” Wisconsin Attorney General Josh Kaul said at a Friday news conference. In April, a federal jury acquitted two men of conspiring to kidnap Whitmer in 2020 and deadlocked on the same charges for two other men.
