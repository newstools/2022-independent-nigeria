LAGOS – As the 2023 general elections draw closer, a youth group, Nigerian Youth Collective Action (NYCA), has called on youths in the country to get their permanent voter’s card in order to partake in the process that would usher in new sets of leaders that would direct their affairs from May 29, 2023. Speaking at a press conference in Lagos on Thursday, Oluseyi Ogunrinde, Southwest Coordinator of NYCA, called on Nigerian youths to brace up and be ready to vote against all political parties that would be presenting older candidates as their presidential flag bearers. While noting that Nigeria is a country with more than 70 percent of its population below the age of 50 years, Ogunrinde disclosed that the group has concluded plans to mobilize the youths to vote for any political party that would present a presidential candidate below the age of 50. -Advertisement- He explained that the youth populace fuels a huge energy capable of delivering sustainable prosperity to the over 200 million Nigerians if well harnessed and rightly targeted. He explained further that the whole essence of the Not-Too –Young -To -Run agitation and the successful passage of the bill into law was to have a generational leadership change “and we applaud the commitment of the President Muhammadu Buhari’s administration in this regard. “The prohibitive costs of nomination forms and the current practice of making very old people presidential candidates of political parties is a direct assault on the Not-Too-Young-To-Run Act and blocks the opportunities for young people. “We condemn, in strong terms, the failure of some political parties to follow the demands of Nigerian youth for a generational shift in leadership and their subsequent selection of old candidates, some close to 80 years old, for the next presidential election. “Nigerian youths will ignore, avoid and not vote for political parties that field candidates above 55 years of age as their Presidential candidates,” he said.
