After losing out on Sven Botman, Milan are not keen to miss out on Renato Sanches as well, even if they’re facing tough competition from Paris Saint-Germain. The Rossoneri have been interested in signing 24-year-old Portuguese midfielder for a while now and they’ve already agreed personal terms, but the Botman case is a painful reminder that bigger offers from other clubs can still disrupt their plans, agreement or not. As highlighted by Calciomercato.com, there are doubts that PSG’s reported offer for Sanches has actually been formalised and submitted and Milan still seem to have a chance to pull off a transfer, although that could change should the French giants actually make a concrete move. The Rossoneri are still confident that they can sign the Portuguese midfielder without increasing their offer, meaning that they’re hoping to close things out on the basis of €18m, with the 24-year-old being given a contract worth €4m net per season.
