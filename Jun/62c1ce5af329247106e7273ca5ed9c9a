The Imo State Gov­ernment has dismissed as un­founded, wicked and mindless fabrication, a recorded voice message making the rounds in the social media, claiming that Governor Hope Uzodimma is down with a stroke and has been rushed to India. Reacting to the voice mes­sage in Owerri Wednesday, the Imo State Commissioner for Information and Strategy, Declan Emelumba, in a state­ment assured the people that Uzodimma is not only hale and hearty but has been energetical­ly attending to all his scheduled activities in the nation’s capital, Abuja. According to him, Uzod­imma is not afflicted with any challenge that would have led to a stroke. -Advertisement- “His Excellency attended a meeting with the President alongside other APC governors Tuesday morning. As I speak, he has entered another party meeting with other stakehold­ers ahead of APC’s convention. So I don’t really know what those concocting this rumour want to achieve,” Emelumba said. The Commissioner warned the purveyors of the rumours to desist forthwith. According to him, it was clear that those who do not wish the governor well have been fantasizing about a phan­tom illness saying, however, that they will continue to be disappointed as Uzodimma is enjoying robust health and at­tending to state duties. Emelumba urged the people of the state and indeed Nigerians todisregard”thisfabricationfrom mentallyderangedelementsseek­ingattentionovernothing.” The statement which was made available to Daily Inde­pendent by Oguwike Nwa­chuku, Chief Press Secretary/ Media Adviser to the Governor, also assured that the matter has been handed over to the rele­vant security agencies to un­ravel those behind the satanic audio recording.
