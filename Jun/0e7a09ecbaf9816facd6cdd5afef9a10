The Ogun State govern­ment has declared that the current administra­tion under the leadership of Governor Dapo Abio­dun did not receive N37b from the Federal Govern­ment, as reimbursement of expenses on road proj­ects carried out by the immediate past admin­istration in the State. It maintained that the said money was pro­cessed and received by the immediate past ad­ministration as payment for the State government expenses on FG roads. Some online news me­dia had erroneously re­ported that the money was paid to Governor Abiodun-led adminis­tration. But reacting to the re­port, the State Commis­sioner for Finance and Chief Economic Adviser, Mr. Dapo Okubadejo, in a statement, explained that the last payment on the Federal Government road refund programme was made before the current administration came on board as all ef­forts to recover further road refunds from the FG have not materialised. “A total of N37bn was paid to the immediate past administration for FG road refund to the State, in two tranches of FG Treasury Note in­struments of N15bn and N22bn respectively. ” The first Treasury Note of N15bn issued in December 2018 was dis­counted in January 2019 for N10bn, while the sec­ond Treasury Note of N22bn was discounted for N17bn during the first quarter of 2019, thereby resulting in to­tal financial charges of about N10bn incurred by the State,” Okubadejo disclosed. While noting that the explanation was neces­sary to put the records straight, he advised jour­nalists to always verify their facts before rush­ing to publish. Okubadejo further maintained that the in­cumbent administration is open and transparent, saying “this explains why it has always pub­lished its Annual Audit­ed Financial Statements, promptly as required.
