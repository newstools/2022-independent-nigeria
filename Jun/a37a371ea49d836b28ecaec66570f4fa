The management of the Lagos State Traffic Management Authority (LASTMA) said its attention has been drawn to a video trending online since yesterday, Thursday, 23 June 2022 alleging the complicity of LASTMA officials in the burning of a bus at Obanikoro area on Ikorodu Road by an uninformed Blogger on Facebook. LASTMA Management after due diligence on the video, sympathise with the vehicle owner but totally denied the complicity of any of its officers in the incident portrayed on the video. Stating rather, that one of the LASTMA patrol officers offering a helping hand to douse the burning vehicle was severely injured by uncalled-for mob action which seems to be occurring nowadays at the slightest alarm. The video report lacked pictorial evidence of LASTMA officers’ complicity; those interviewed were neither eyewitnesses nor people directly involved in the incident, rather, they were people living within the inside street, close to the scene of the incident on Ikorodu Road. Their pieces of evidence were hearsays and gotten before the arrival of officials of security agencies to maintain law and order, attacks on one of the LASTMA officials and also the Fire Fighters who were there to render assistance in putting out the fire in the vehicle. LASTMA officials do not operate within side street and over time, the State Government has announced zero tolerance to attacking its officials while performing their duties as enshrined in the laws or as directed. We wish to reiterate that LASTMA personnel must not be attacked/assaulted while performing their duties or rendering service to the public. The LASTMA management also use this opportunity to advise reporters/bloggers to endeavour to conduct a proper investigation and present facts rather than sentiments in their reportage for a peaceful and orderly society.
