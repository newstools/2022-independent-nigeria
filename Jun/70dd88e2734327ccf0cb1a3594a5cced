Reno Omokri, a former aide to ex-president Goodluck Jonathan has called on the Peoples Democratic Party candidate, Atiku Abubakar to start preparing his inauguration speech ahead of the 2023 presidential election. Omokri stated this while reacting to the emergence of the former Lagos State Governor, Bola Tinubu as the flag bearer of the All Progressives Congress, APC. Acording to Omokri, Atiku would beat Tinubu in the presidential election. In a post on his Facebook page, Reno wrote, “far as I am concerned, HE Atiku should start writing his inauguration speech. As long as God spares his life, I do not see anything stopping him from winning the 2023 election. “I spent time and money to campaign for Tinubu because we knew Osinbajo would be harder to defeat! “Because of Kwankwaso’s entry into the Presidential race, Northern votes would be split between HE Atiku and Kwankwaso. It is Southern votes that will determine the 2023 election. “Those of you who thought I was campaigning for Tinubu did not know the strategy. I am not a fool. I could kiss the APC delegates for joy”!
