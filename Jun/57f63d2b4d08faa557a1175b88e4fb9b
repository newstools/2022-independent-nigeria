Barcelona have decided to rule out the possibility of signing Valencia midfielder Carlos Soler, writes Ruben Uria in his column for GOAL. The current economic situation of Valencia is not very different from Barcelona. While the distinction between the two is massive, Valencia, too, need to sanction a few sales in order to generate as much as €60 million before June 31. And this is exactly why the team would like to cash in on Soler. The reasons are pretty simple. His ongoing contract expires in 2023, and contrary to the usual belief, the Spanish side is yet to enter formal talks with the midfielder. They know there will not be any extension in the future, meaning that the possibility of Soler leaving for free next season is pretty much high. In fact, the situation has gone down to an extent that no one from the club has approached the player or even his manager in that regard. And so, the team has now given the green light to his sale in order to avoid incurring losses this season. GOAL points out that Soler is one of the several high profile names who could be a part of the needed exodus. This includes the likes of Goncalo Guedes, Jose Gaya and Jasper Cillissen. The moment of such panic has been asked to be extinguished by a certain Jorge Mendes so that the team avoids the financial collapse. In all fairness, this was the only reason why Valencia’s former president, Anil Murthy, travelled to Barcelona to offer Soler and Gaya to Barcelona. POLL For once, it all seemed like a regular football gossip back then, but there was no way for Barcelona to spend money on the mentioned players. As of today, Barça have decided to pull out of the deal altogether because they just cannot pay the transfer fee. And all this gives Atletico Madrid a clear edge in the speculation. If reports are to be believed, Diego Simeone’s team are willing to play the waiting game, and this has made them the top contenders to land the 25-year-old.
