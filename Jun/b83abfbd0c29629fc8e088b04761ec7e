LAGOS – The leadership of the Forum of Political Parties (FPP) in Lagos State has congratulated Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu, the All Progressives Congress (APC) presidential candidate for emerging victorious in his party’s presidential primaries. Mr. Kola Ajayi, FPP Chairman, in a statement at the weekend, said that Tinubu’s victory was well deserved as he had worked very hard for it, adding that the former Lagos State governor had been recognised as the leader of the Progressives in the Nigerian politics. Ajayi stated that Tinubu had been consistent like the Northern Star in his quest for a better Nigeria on the Progressive turf, adding that his consistency, doggedness and foresight paid off handsomely with the result he garnered at the presidential primary convention. The FPP chairman stressed: “Now that the primaries are over, we urge you to be magnanimous in victory and start building bridges. Let us work as a team towards winning the general elections in 2023. “Asiwaju Tinubu has started very well with his visit to President Muhammadu Buhari, and his fellow contestants, Vice President, Prof. Yemi Osinbajo and others. “As the Asiwaju said in his acceptance speech at the convention that he bore no grudges against anyone, we urge him to please work the talk and extend open arms to all and bring everybody on board to achieve victory in 2023. “We shall continue to work for him and support his ambition till we achieve victory in 2023. We will also continue to support the hard-working Lagos State governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu, to also win his re-election with a landslide in 2023. “We shall roll out our programme of actions in the coming weeks. We look forward to free, fair and credible general elections in 2023 in Lagos State and Nigeria as a whole 2023.”
