MINNA – A university Don, Professor Dickson Achimugu Musa has made a strong case for all eligible voters to get their PVCs and be ready to vote in 2023 general elections, arguing that Nigeria cannot attain desired socio-economic and political greatness comparable to contemporaries world over if government and governance continue to rest on the shoulders of people who has no interest of citizens at heart. Nigeria since her independence in 1960 has remained under the control of people from a particular region and religion, these and many more he said may have largely accounted for stunted growth and development of the various sectors of the Nigerian economy. Professor Musa made the observation at the maiden edition of a political awareness programme tagged, ‘Political Round Table Discussion’ with the theme: Nigeria and the issues of Now: 2023 elections in View, organised by the House on the Rock Church, Minna in Niger state over the weekend. Nigeria has all that is needed to become one of the super powers among third world countries, but why the country has remained stagnated since independence has been a source of concerns to him and other elite Nigerians across the different segments of the society. Musa, who is Professor of Pharmacological Biochemistry and Biotechnology and the Director Trans-Saharan Disease Research Centre, Ibrahim Badamasi Babangida University (IBBU), Lapai in Niger state lamented that, Nigeria has whatever it takes to be great but years of bad leadership has stunted the political and socio-economic growth and development of the most populous black nation in the world. With the 2023 elections beckoning, Musa is calling on the elites and other eligible voters not to allow another opportunity to elect credible leaders to waste by ensuring that they come out en-masse and get their PVCs or revalidate existing ones and also be ready to vote for credible candidates with proven integrity to succeed President Muhammadu Buhari next year. The President Nigeria needs in 2023 is someone who has the knowledge of Nigeria’s numerous socio-economic and political challenges and is willingly ready to fix it within shortest possible time for the country to come back alive. Professor Musa who particularly faulted the attitudes of Christians who erroneously believe that politics and political contests were ‘dirty’ encouraged faithful to join politics and be part of efforts at bringing sanity to the entire system come 2023 general election. Also speaking, Pastor PeteRock Sadiq said the political round table is aimed at raising the consciousness women and youths in Niger state, Christians in particular on the need to be part of political processes that will usher in a new government come 2023. Pastor Sadiq expressed plans to ensure that the political Roundtable comes up monthly until eligible voters in Niger state are sufficiently enlightened on the importance of joining hands to build Nigeria of our collective dreams by voting for candidates to meet the needs and aspirations of Nigerians next year. The Pastor who expressed optimisms that ‘Nigeria will be great again’, told guests at the Political Roundtable which took place at the church auditorium, Minna to take home what they have learnt and encourage their wards and relatives to actively participate in politics in order to vote out people who has nothing good to offer than actualising their own personal gains.
