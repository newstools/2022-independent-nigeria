Operatives of the Econom­ic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) on Tuesday stormed the Ea­gle Square venue of the All Progressives Congress (APC) special convention in Abuja. The officials went round the convention venue be­fore finally they took stra­tegic positions. However, the officials de­clined comment when ap­proached at the convention. EFCC officials had made similar appearance at the PDP special convention in Abuja on May 28, without making any arrest. The visit might not be unconnected with recent social media reports indi­cating that delegates were paid hugely by presidential aspirants for votes at the convention.
