After at least eight months of concerted efforts to attain a truce in Kebbi State on the platform of the All Progressives Congress (APC) which hadn’t yielded positive results, Senator Adamu Alieru has defected to the opposition People’s Democratic Party (PDP). In a viral voice message seen by a Daily Independent correspondent and corroborated by his media aid, Abdullahi Zuru has confirmed his defection to PDP for good. According to Zuru via telephone interview on Thursday said that Senator Alieru a bridge builder has made himself available for a truce eight months ago just for peace and unity of the APC and for easy campaigns but Bagudu and the National leadership of the party didnt pay any heed and did not as well call the governor to order to stop the maltreatment he has been meting out to Alieru. He added that aside from that Northwest governors have also held meetings on the issue of truce between Alieru and the sitting governor of Kebbi state Bagudu but he didn’t nt honour the invitation extended to him but details of the meeting were sent to him yet no response from him “this and many more compounded and aggravated the situation hence his reason to dump APC and joined PDP to continue with his political journey of bringing positive developments. Zuru wondered why an invaluable political asset like Alieru will be treated as a commoner when he has been unifying three states Sokoto, Zamfara and Kebbi and led them to political victories ” we are now all out and this the beginning of a huge political war in Kebbi to peacefully through the ballot box wrestle power from the APC and rescue Kebbi. Recall that from the beginning before his defection Senator Adamu had opened a factional APC secretariat which may have triggered what transpired between the Kebbi.
