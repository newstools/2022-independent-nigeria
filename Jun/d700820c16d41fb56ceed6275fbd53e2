Anambra State Police operatives collaborating with security agents at about 4 pm on 24/6/2022 have rescued from mob action and arrested one Sunday Nwadiagba ‘M’ aged 30years from Eyiba, Ebonyi State for allegedly raping a 75yrs old woman living in Nkwelle Awkuzu Oyi local government area of Anambra state. The press statement released to journalists in Awka yesterday by the Police Public Relations Officer DSP Ikenga Tochukwu Anthony has it that preliminary information revealed that the suspect was caught in the act at the farm on the victim, before the old woman screaming, got the attention of the passer-by and neighbours. Before his arrest, an angry mob had already beaten him to a stupor. Meanwhile, the victim and the suspect have been taken to the hospital for medical attention. The Commissioner of Police, CP Echeng Echeng has reiterated the campaign against mob action by some members of the public who resort to jungle justice whenever they arrest suspects in respect of any crime. The CP in the statement made it clear that they should endeavour to take such suspects to the nearest Police station whenever they are apprehended. That it would afford the Police the opportunity to conduct an appropriate investigation into the nefarious activities of the suspects and bring them to justice in accordance with extant laws.
