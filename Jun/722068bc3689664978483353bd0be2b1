Emmanuel Deutsch, the Sun­shine Stars of Akure manager, has promised a comeback for the Owena Whales after they suffered a 2-0 loss to Enyimba International of Aba in a match decided at the Aba Township Stadium. In the match-day 31 game, Elephants took control when Emeka Obioma scored from Sadiq Abubakar’s cross at the stroke of the half hour mark. The renewed efforts of Sun­shine Stars to restore parity be­fore the break yielded no result. -Advertisement- With clear-cut chances few and far between in the second period, Sunshine’s fate was sealed 11 minutes from time when Samuel Stone scored the hosts second against the run of play. Despite a late rally, Owena Whales could not get a route back into the contest as Eny­imba held firmly for the win. With the result Sunshine Stars dropped a place to ninth on the log, nonetheless Coach Deutcsh is pleased with his boys efforts. “Our boys gave a positive approach to the clash, posing early threats to the People’s Elephants through Chigozie Chilekwu and Azeez Ajagbe’s attempts inside the opening quarter of an hour. “It’s a good game! I am satis­fied with what my boys played; they played well. Congratula­tions to Enyimba! losing to Eny­imba is not the end of the world, the league is still on and we have two home matches coming up, we will bounce back. POLL “Nothing went wrong, that’s football; something you have to learn how to accept defeat, draw or winning. You have to accept everything.” Meanwhile, Sunshine Stars will regroup at home for the visit of Nasarawa United on Sunday. This is one match the Owe­na Whales will do well to win in order to remain at the mid­dle of the table as there are still potential chances of hitting the res zone for any of the mid table teams.
