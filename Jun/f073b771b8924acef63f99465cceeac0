The 24-year-old joined the Dutch side from Toulouse in 2020 and is believed to have a release clause of around £30million. The Ivorian, who has three years left on his contract, has also been linked with a move to Newcastle United and Liverpool who are looking to bolster their midfields. According to Sky Sports, Sangare wants a transfer to the Premier League and is ‘convinced’ he will be playing in England’s top-flight next season. Sangare was a mainstay in PSV’s team last term, making 49 appearances as they won the Dutch cup and finished runners-up to Ajax in the Eredivisie. United are keen on signing a midfielder due to the departures of Nemanja Matic and Paul Pogba, and may see Sangare as a viable alternative to the likes of West Ham’s Declan Rice and Barcelona’s Frenkie de Jong. Meanwhile, as a defensive midfielder, Sangare could provide cover at Chelsea for N’Golo Kante who missed large parts of last season with injury. The Frenchman’s absences were often highlighted as a reason for the Blues’ shortcomings as they failed to launch a title challenge and defend their Champions League crown. In May, Chelsea manager Thomas Tuchel described Kante as a ‘key player’ and likened him to some of Europe’s top stars. POLL He said: ‘I think he is our key, key, key player; but key, key, key players need to be on the pitch. ‘He plays only 40 per cent of the games. So it’s maybe a miracle that we arrived in third place. ‘Because he is our Mo Salah, he is our (Virgil) Van Dijk, he is our (Kevin) De Bruyne, he is simply that player. ‘He is our Neymar, he is our Kylian Mbappe; he is the guy who makes the difference.’
