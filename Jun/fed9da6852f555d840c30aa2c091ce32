In a major update, as reported by Relevo, Barcelona and Angel Di Maria are in talks over a potential transfer in the summer transfer window. The 34-year-old Argentine international will become a free agent next month, with his contract at Paris Saint-Germain set to expire on June 30.A player with a proven pedigree in La Liga and Ligue 1, Angel Di Maria has tasted success everywhere he has been, barring his one-year stint with Manchester United. The versatile winger is coming on the back of a decent season with PSG where he was directly involved in 14 goals from 31 matches in all competitions. -Advertisement- Juventus have been trying to sign Di Maria on a free transfer and have been working on a deal for two months as per the report. The Bianconeri are willing to offer him a lucrative two-year contract as well. However, Di Maria is favouring a return to Spain and is hoping to secure a transfer to Barcelona. And it seems like the interest has been reciprocated by the Catalan giants, who are also seeing the winger as a viable target for the summer. The Blaugrana need a new wide player as they prepare to bid goodbye to Ousmane Dembele. Raphinha of Leeds United has been the priority target, but his transfer fee makes the deal complicated. Di Maria, due to his availability as a free agent, is seen as a viable target, while his experience in La Liga adds further value. Both parties have held talks over a possible move and the discussions have been largely positive. If they do decide to go ahead with the move, Di Maria would likely be offered a one-year contract as he wishes to return to Argentine side Rosario Central in 2023. However, for a move to happen, Barcelona must make some sales and free up space on their wage bill.
