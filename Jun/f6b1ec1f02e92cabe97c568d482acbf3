Serbia midfield talisman Nemanja Matic will leave Manchester United for free in the summer, and a move to Roma is in the picture, reuniting him with former boss Jose Mourinho for the second time in his career. The duo worked together first at Chelsea, winning the 2014/15 Premier League title, before the Special One signed him for the Red Devils in 2017. He will sign with the Giallorossi on a one-year contract worth €3.5M net per season, with an option to extend it for a further year into 2023/24. Mourinho has always been a fan of the defensive midfielder, and likewise, Matic has never hid his love for the ex-Chelsea and Inter gaffer, because of which it is understood that he rejected several offers from across Europe to move to Roma. The 33-year-old Serb will become the second-oldest player in a relatively young Giallorossi side with an average age of 25. Such addition into the Italian capital’s side will be their third one from the Premier League since welcoming Rui Patricio and Tammy Abraham from Wolves and Chelsea respectively last season. Our Take on Matic Joining RomaBoth Matic and Mourinho will work for the third time together in their career, and Roma are set to benefit from the veteran’s presence as he adds experience, reliability and authority to a midfield that can do with a little more bolstering.
