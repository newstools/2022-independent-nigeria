With a contract expiring in 2023, Marco Asensio either needs to be sold by Real Madrid or renew with the La Liga side. While the Spanish club are prepared to give him a new contract, they aren’t doing so with the wages he wants, which means an exit is more likely. Among the many names linked have been Manchester United, where Erik ten Hag is trying to put a mini-revolution in place, getting rid of the Old Trafford deadwood to kickstart a new era. Last we heard, Corriere dello Sport were claiming the Red Devils could meet the asking price, touted to be around €30-35m, ‘with their eyes closed’. Well, Sport have an update on the situation, revealing on Monday that he is the player ‘who can leave the most money in the Real Madrid coffers’ this summer. His market value is currently at €40m, and ‘three clubs are pushing for the signing’, with those being Manchester United, Milan and Chelsea. The player is reportedly ‘up for auction’, and he will choose his next team based on two specific guidelines: ‘that they meet his wage demands of between €7-8m per season post tax and the guarantee of being a starter’. That’s probably something Manchester United can do for both demands, all depending on what Erik ten Hag plans on doing elsewhere in his team. -Advertisement- POLL We all know the main target is Frenkie de Jong, and it seems Manchester United will need around €40m, rather than €30-35m, to get the Spaniard if they want him.
