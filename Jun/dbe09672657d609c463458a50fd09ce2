 P/HARCOURT  – The Port Harcourt Zonal Command of the Econom­ic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) said its operatives were pre­vented from arresting the Rivers State governorship candidate of the Peoples’ Democratic Party (PDP) in the 2023 election in the state, Siminialayi Fubara, a suspect under the watch-list of the commission. The anti-graft agency alleged that thugs who breached the security of the Port Harcourt Airport Inter­national Airport, Omagwa, Rivers State on Tuesday night blocked the operatives from carrying out their law­ful duty of arresting Fuba­ra, who has been declared wanted for graft by the com­mission. A statement by the Head, Media and Publicity of the commission, Wilson Uwu­jaren, said, “the armed thugs assaulted operatives of the commission who demonstrat­ed commendable restraint under extreme provocation. The commission condemns the blatant attempt to ob­struct justice, warning that its civility should not be taken for granted”. The drama took place at the Port Harcourt Interna­tional Airport as the plane carrying Fubara and other PDP chieftains, who had accompanied him to Abuja to receive the Certificate of Return as the PDP governor­ship candidate touched down at the airport. Sources said that as the operatives moved to arrest him, some youths believed to be his supporters, allegedly resisted the officials and at­tacked them. Details of the attack were still scanty as of the time of filing this report, but witness­es at the airport said some of the EFCC operatives sus­tained some degree of inju­ries.
