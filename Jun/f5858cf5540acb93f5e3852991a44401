Chelsea have been handed a major transfer boost after Paris Saint-Germain have informed Neymar he is not part of the club’s plans ahead of next season. The Brazilian signed for the French giants in a world-record £200million transfer in 2017. Thomas Tuchel’s Chelsea have been monitoring Neymar’s situation, as they ambition a swoop for the Brazilian this summer. Following a disappointing season for the French side, owner Nasser Al-Khelaifi has reviewed the different aspects of the club. Mauricio Pochettino is set to get the sack despite guiding the club to the Ligue 1 title in his first year in charge. Though, a poor campaign in the Champions League and Neymar’s commitment has led Al-Khelaifi to want to cut ties with the player. According to Spanish outlet Mundo Deportivo, the Parisian side has been “fed up” with the forward, after Kylian Mbappe has reportedly highlighted the “systematic indiscipline” from the Brazilian’s training and post-party recoveries. “Neymar does not like to train; he has played with three or four extra kilos for years. But in the competition he has been the most honest attacker of the team, the one who has run the most to help [the team] and defend himself,” a close source said One’s loss is another’s gain however, as Chelsea have now been given the chance to sign the 30-year-old. The report states that world transfer signing was left angered by the owner’s comments about him.
