President Joe Biden told Americans that the latest jobs numbers show that the United States is in a good position to fight inflation concerns about rising prices persist. Mr Biden’s words come as the latest Bureau of Labor Statistics report showed that the US economy added 390,000 non-farm payroll jobs in May while the unemployment rate remained static at 3.6 per cent. “I know that even with today’s good news, a lot of Americans remain anxious, and I understand the feeling”, Mr Biden said in an address on Friday. Specifically, he said that high prices around gasoline and food at the grocery are a source of anxiety for many American consumers. -Advertisement- “But there’s every reason for the American people to feel confident that we’ll meet these challenges”, he said. “Because of the enormous progress that we’ve made on the economy, Americans can tackle inflation from a position of strength.” Mr Biden blamed higher gasoline and food prices on Russian President Vladimir Putin’s war on Ukraine.
