Alhaji (Dr) Mohammed Abubakar Bambado ll, the Sarkin Fulani of Lagos State and Chairman Council of Fulani Chiefs, south-west Nigeria, on behalf of his council members and Kinsmen has condemned the killings of some worshippers at St. Francis Catholic church Owo, Ondo State on Sunday during Church service by gunmen. The monarch’s condemnation of the dastardly act was contained in a statement he signed and made available to newsmen in Lagos. According to him, “this evil attack on peace-loving people of Owo Kingdom, who have enjoyed relative peace over the years, was condemnable in the real sense of the word.” The monarch therefore commiserates with families of those who lost their loved ones in the ugly and unfortunate attack, just as he also extends his condolences to the Olowo of Owo, Oba Gbadegesin Ogunoye, the Catholic Church, and as well His Excellency the Executive Governor of Ondo State, Chief Rotimi Akeredolu (SAN), while wishing the injured a quick recovery. The Royal Father urged security operatives to commit all available resources at their disposal to hunt down assailants and make them face the law, appealing to the public to allow the relevant security agents to do their work before jumping into any erroneous conclusion that can jeopardise their operations towards fishing out the perpetrators to face the music. “At this period of political activities towards the election years of 2023, all hands should be on deck collectively to work on issues that would unite us the more and stay clear of any act that can cause undue tension or aggravate imaginary crisis,” Bambado cautioned.
