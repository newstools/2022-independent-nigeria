This is integral to us as a global brand because it helps us to create an enabling environment that supports the process of continuous learning. We are, therefore, confident that this initiative will encourage growth and development across the community which will invariably help in championing educational activities around financial literacy amongst Nigerian youth through our diverse youth-led initiatives,” he said. This social-driven initiative further reiterates the core principles of the organisation which is focused on giving back to local communities with the aim of providing young people with a brighter perspective on life.
