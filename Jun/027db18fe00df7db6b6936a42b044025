Suspected terrorists carried out the deadly attack on Sunday with many worshippers killed and several others injured following the incident at the church. In a statement issued in Abuja and made available to journalists on Sunday evening, the three-term Senator said: “I deplore the heinous attack on St. Francis Catholic Church, Owo – the hometown of Governor Rotimi Akeredolu, which left scores of worshippers dead and several others injured. Clearly, the perpetrators of the cowardly act have no regard for the sanctity of human life. -Advertisement- “I extend my deepest condolences to the bereaved families; and my solidarity and support to Governor Rotimi Akeredolu-led Ondo State Government, the people of Owo Kingdom and by extension, people of the Sunshine State. May God grant the affected families the fortitude to bear the huge loss. “Terrorism has no place in Yorubaland. In fact, there is no justification for the heinous attack. To this end, I urge all the law enforcement agencies to collaboratively launch a manhunt to bring the assailants to book, in accordance with the laws of the land. “Meanwhile, I enjoin Nigerians to remain vigilant and report any suspicious movements to security operatives. Terrorists are not spirits. They live in our midst. We must have zero tolerance for them. The damages they are doing to our country are unimaginable. “Also, I charge our religious centres to rejig their security architectures with a view to forestalling attacks by men of the underworld.”
