German players will receive a record performance-related bonus €60,000 if they win the Women’s Euro 2022 following an agreement between the German FA (DFB) and the team’s representatives. The players were represented by Alexandra Popp, Almuth Schult, Sara Däbritz, Lina Magull and Lena Oberdorf for the negotiations. The €60,000 they will receive each for winning the Euros is double the €30,000 for reaching the final. They will receive €20,000 each for reaching the semi-final, or €10,000 if they only progress to the quarter-finals. In 2017, the bonus for winning the tournament stood at €37,500. Germany were eliminated by Denmark in the second round. -Advertisement- “It is a good result that the team council agreed with the DFB and overall a positive development,” said Germany coach Martina Voss-Tecklenburg.  “It shows the character of the team that it was important to the players to negotiate the bonuses with a strong focus on success and performance.” UEFA has established the prize money for the 2022 Women’s Euro at €16 million. At last year’s men’s tournament, the prize money totalled €331 million. On July 6, hosts England and Austria will kick off this summer’s continental championship, the first time the finals will be staged in a 24-team format.
