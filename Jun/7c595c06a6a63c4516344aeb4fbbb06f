Philanthropists and well-meaning personalities have been called upon to rescue the underprivileged from the current prevailing socio-economic depression in the country. Dr. Funmilola Wil­liams-Daudu, coordinator, Milteda Wellness Initiative, made the call in Akure, the Ondo State capital, while commenting on the mortal­ity rate, particularly among those living below minimum living standard. She observed that the cur­rent socio-economic challeng­es in the country contributed immensely to the high mor­tality rate. -Advertisement- Dr. Williams-Daudu, who received the Professional Role Model in Medical Prac­tice Award presented by Sun­shine Standard on Sunday in Akure, emphasised that it’s only philanthropists and well-meaning individuals that could help ameliorate the challenges being faced by the underprivileged through empowerment programmes. She explained that some of the people needed training in some vocations with tools and little capital to start off a business, thereby calling on philanthropists to engage in human capacity building schemes for the underprivi­leged in the nearest commu­nities.
