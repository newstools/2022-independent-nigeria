LAGOS – Renowned smartphone brand TECNO has announced Tiwa Savage as its new brand ambassador. The announcement, which was made across the TECNO’s social media accounts, included the release of photos and videos of the singer acknowledging her new status as a member of the TECNO family. This makes Tiwa Savage the first female brand ambassador signed by the brand. Savage, pleased with the partnership, said: “TECNO is a very special smartphone brand. Wherever you turn in many parts of the world, you feel the presence of the brand. I have always admired how far the brand has come and what it stands for, so I didn’t have to think about it before deciding to join the TECNO family. Their ‘Stop at Nothing’ brand slogan and pursuit for excellence very much aligns with what I believe in and is testament to how far I have come in my career despite facing many challenges. Beyond the sleek design and awesome camera that TECNO smartphones come with, the brand also has a renewed focus on supporting the African youth and this also inspires me to want to be part of the story. “I am super excited about the partnership and our fans can be assured of an amazing Journey and experience with us.” The singer, in her prolific style, had fun posing with a TECNO smartphone in the video and photos released. Addressing the media in Lagos recently, TECNO’s PR Communications and Media Manager, Vincent Uzoegbu, said: “Tiwa Savage is a huge inspiration to millions of young people. “Her pursuit for excellence and her journey to becoming one of Africa’s biggest artistes is nothing short of a story of tenacity and an unrelenting spirit, something we at TECNO very much relate with, understand, and support.”
