Tottenham Hotspur have announced their list of released players for the coming Premier League season. The club have to submit their list to the Premier League of first team and academy players who will be retained for the coming season and Spurs have now confirmed those who will not be on that list and available for Antonio Conte for the 2022/23 campaign. Pierluigi Gollini has returned to Atalanta following the conclusion of his loan spell, having made 10 appearances for the club. The goalkeeper was a popular member of the squad and his deal could have become permanent had either he made 20 appearances for Spurs or they had paid a £12.9m option within his loan deal. Southampton goalkeeper Fraser Forster is expected to join Tottenham on a free transfer this month to step into Gollini’s shoes as Hugo Lloris’ understudy. -Advertisement- Spurs have also announced the departures of development squad players J’Neil Bennett, Kacper Kurylowicz, Dermi Lusala, Thimothee Lo-Tutala, Josh Oluwayemi, Tobi Omole and Isak Solberg following the conclusion of their contracts.
