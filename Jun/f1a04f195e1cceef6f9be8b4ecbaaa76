Lionel Messi and Angel di Maria shone as Argentina beat Italy at Wembley in the Finalissima – a renewal of the contest between the champions of Europe and South America. Messi’s run and cross set up the opener for Lautaro Martinez, who then turned provider for Di Maria to chip a second. Substitute Paulo Dybala rounded off a handsome win in injury time. -Advertisement- Italian defender Giorgio Chiellini played the first half of what was his 118th and final international match. The contest is the first between the two continental champions in 29 years. It is a revival of the Artemio Franchi Cup, which competed twice before – in 1985, when France beat Uruguay and in 1993, when Argentina beat Denmark on penalties. (SOURCE: BBC)
