Reports suggest a sudden hiccup in the deal to bring Luka Jovic to Fiorentina, because Real Madrid coach Carlo Ancelotti isn’t happy with it. Sportitalia and Sky Sport Italia were confident the agreement had been reached between the two clubs and he was expected next week for a medical. The striker was all set to arrive on loan for one season, with Real Madrid shouldering half his €6m per season salary. However, Radio Bruno in Florence claim this evening that there has been a sudden stall in the move, because coach Ancelotti was not asked to give his verdict. The tactician is eager to keep Jovic in his squad after winning LaLiga and the Champions League. Purchased for €63m from Eintracht Frankfurt, the 24-year-old made just 19 competitive appearances for Real Madrid this season, contributing one goal and three assists. It may well be just a slight delay more than something that could break the negotiations.
