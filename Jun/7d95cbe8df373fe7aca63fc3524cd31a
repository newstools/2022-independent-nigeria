ABUJA – Senator Abdullahi Adamu, Chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC) has charged delegates to the party’s special Convention to choose wisely as they seek President Mohammadu Buhari’s successor and flagbearer of the party in the 2023 general election. Addressing a mammoth crowd of party faithful and supporters at the Eagles Square Tuesday night, in Abuja, Senator Adamu said the party cannot afford to choose its next leader on the basis of sentiments or other primordial considerations. The successor to President Buhari, he said must share his vision and ideals, even as he maintained that the APC need not fragment because of the ambition of its members. He said that choosing a presidential standard-bearer for any party is not only a difficult task but a burden that the party must undertake with forethought so as not to regret. He, therefore, cautioned that since only one person would eventually emerge from the array of qualified applicants, some of the applicants may be called to make compromises in the interest of the unity of the party and in accord with democratic ideals. Adamu stressed that the APC must go into 2023 strong and united, noting that the positive responses of party men and women since the coming into office of the president National Working Committee (NWC) gives confidence that the APC the healing process in the party is in progress. Earlier, while addressing the delegates, Co-Chairman of the Election Planning subcommittee and Imo State Governor Hope Uzodinma assured the party of a Transparent, free and fair Election.
