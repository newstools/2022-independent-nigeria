LAGOS – Following the ultimatum of 14 days given by the Lagos State Government to the traders at Alaba Rago market located at Ojo, Lagos State, the Sarkin Fulani of Lagos State, His Royal Highness, Alhaji (Dr) Mohammed Abubakar Bambado II has waded in and appealed to the government to reconsider the suit order with a view to give the traders more time to tidy up things. Dr. Bambado, who also doubles as the Chairman Council of Fulani Chiefs South West of Nigeria intervened in the agitating issue by meeting the State Governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu on behalf of the traders on the earlier quit notice. In a statement signed by the monarch and made available to newsmen, he said, “considering the plea, His Excellency Mr. Governor on behalf of the Lagos State government hereby reversed its earlier pronouncement and allowed the traders in Alaba Rago to continue with their legitimate business in the market pending a formal agreement and development plan considering the current traders.” -Advertisement- He, therefore, called on the traders and business entrepreneurs in the market to remain calm and maintain a law-abiding environment free from delinquent activities, pending the arrangement from the government and the parties concerned. Dr. Bambado, therefore, appreciated the Governor for being a listening governor realising that, the step earlier taken by his administration was not meant to be punitive but truly to pave way for development to continue. It would be recalled that a few days ago, Lagos State gave the traders at the market under discussion a two-week ultimatum to quit the vicinity with a view to giving the government the space for more development to take place.
