England football fans in Munich have been arrested for making Nazi salutes despite pleas from Three Lions manager Gareth Southgate to behave. Eight people were arrested on Monday ahead of the Nations League tie with Germany on Tuesday evening, largely in the downtown area of Munich. The arrests come amid calls to repair England fans’ damaged reputation, particularly in light of the unsavoury scenes at Wembley during the Euro 2020 final. Three of them were arrested for making Nazi salutes, while police said another fan caused an estimated 2,000 euro (£1,700) damage after he let off a flare inside his hotel room. Four others were arrested for incidents including insulting police officers and urinating in the street. Many of the troublemakers were ordered to pay a security deposit of around 200 euro (£170) – the local equivalent of an on-the-spot fine – while two who were unable to pay the money were brought before a district judge. Pub and bar closures Some bars in the city closed early on Monday after becoming overwhelmed by the number of customers as large groups of fans wearing England replica shirts and carrying flags sang in the warm sunshine. POLL Other pubs did not open at all on Tuesday after reports of incidents getting out of hand among some supporters. Police were called to one “brawl” on Monday, reported to have involved 30 to 50 England fans, but said it had dispersed by the time armed officers arrived on the scene.
