Bayern Munich have asked Napoli for information about Victor Osimhen as they consider possible replacements for Robert Lewandowski. The 23-year-old Nigerian forward had a strong season under Luciano Spalletti, scoring 14 goals in 27 Serie A appearances, but he could be sold this summer as the Partenopei look to reduce their wage bill and revitalise their squad, although he would not come cheap. As reported by Corriere dello Sport, Bayern contacted Napoli to ask for information about Osimhen and the feasibility of a possible deal. The German giants are looking to replace Lewandowski and are considering a number of top options. -Advertisement- Osimhen is a much wanted figure, however, with Manchester United, Arsenal and Newcastle United all interested in making a summer move for him. Things have cooled off on this front a little, though. Napoli have been clear regarding their €100m price tag, so a top offer will be needed to secure the Nigerian’s signature in the coming months.
