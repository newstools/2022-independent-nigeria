Abuja – The National Judicial Council on Tuesday asked Justice Osatohanmwen Obaseki-Osagie of the National Industrial Court Abuja to grant the reliefs sought in a suit seeking upward review of salaries of judicial officers in the country. NJC is the 4th defendant in the suit, which was filed by the claimant, Chief Sebastine Hon SAN. Other defendants in the suit are the National Assembly (1st defendant), the Revenue Mobilization, Allocation and Fiscal Commission (2nd defendant), and the Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice (3rd defendant). NJC’s counsel in the matter, Kunle Adegoke, while adopting his written address and other processes, urged the court to uphold the suit. Adegoke expressed reservation that salaries of judicial officers have been stagnant for over 14 years without review. Contrary to the objections of the NASS and AGF that the claimant lacked the locus standi to institute the suit, the NJC counsel reminded the court that the issue of locus standi has been liberalized all over the world especially when an issue borders on public interest. Adegoke insisted that the NASS and the AGF have failed in their duty to better the remuneration of judicial office holders. By the suit, Sebastine Hon, is praying the court to compel the defendants to increase the salaries and allowances of judges in the country. An affidavit filed by Hon, in support of the originating summons, averred that as a legal practitioner, “who has practiced in all the levels of courts in Nigeria, I know that poor pay for judicial officers is seriously affecting the quality of judgments and rulings those officers are delivering and the discharge of other functions associated with their offices.” He posited among other depositions that the current economic reality in the country requires that the salaries and allowances of the nation’s judges be urgently improved
