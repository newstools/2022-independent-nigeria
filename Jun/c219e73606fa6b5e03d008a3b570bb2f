Jigawa State governor, Abubakar Badaru, has withdrawn from the presidential primary of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC). His withdrawal from the race came moments after northern governors on the platform of the party declared their support for power shift to the Southern part of the country. President Muhammadu Buhari is currently meeting with the presidential aspirants cleared to participate in the primary slated to June 7 in Abuja.
