Borussia Monchengladbach have appointed Daniel Farke as their new head coach. Farke, 45, has been out of work since he left Russian club Krasnodar following the nation’s invasion of neighbouring Ukraine. He did not take charge of a single Krasnodar match. -Advertisement- Farke previously spent five years in charge of the English side Norwich City, leading the club to two Championship titles. But he was replaced by Dean Smith midway through the current campaign, with Norwich rooted to the bottom of the Premier League table. Monchengladbach sporting director Roland Virkus told the club website on Saturday: “In Daniel Farke, we have been able to sign a coach that fits perfectly to the path that we want to go down as a club. “We are looking forward to tackling the challenges that lie ahead of us, together with him.” Monchengladbach parted ways with former head coach Adi Hutter last month, following a disappointing 10th-placed Bundesliga finish in his first season in charge at Borussia-Park.
