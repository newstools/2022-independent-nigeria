LAGOS – Senator Ebenezer Ikeyina, national leader of the Social Democratic Party (SDP), has urged the Federal Government to rise to its responsibility and tackle the rising insecurity in the country. Ikeyina, in a press statement on Tuesday said that insecurity in the country was becoming alarming, pointing out that the ambiguity of the Federal Government and the failure of the security agencies to deal with the situation may have given rise to the call by Zamfara State Governor, who suggested that indigenes should be given arms to protect themselves. “If the citizens should resort to carrying arms to protect themselves, that will amount to the abdication of the government’s primary and constitutional responsibility of protecting the lives and properties of its citizens,” Ikeyina said. “The government must find a solution to this cankerworm before it consumes us. We have heard stories of people paying ransom to be allowed to stay in their communities and many of them have abandoned their farms and that is another source of worry because the state of insecurity in the country is worsening by the day, with devastating impacts on the welfare and livelihood of the ordinary Nigerians.
