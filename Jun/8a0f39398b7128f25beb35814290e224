This is obviously a good time and reason to celebrate the working and performing governor of Ogun State, Prince Dapo Abiodun. Every May 29, since 2019, the oil and gas mogul-cum-politician has always been in a dual coterie of celebration. Apart from being born on that day, significantly sworn in on the same day as the executive governor of the gateway state. This year’s celebrations are coming on the heels of his remarkable and impressive score card in infrastructure and laudable achievements in his third year in office; just as he modestly marked his 62nd birthday in life. To boot and as an addendum to his resourcefulness in office, the man with a strong political mien and agility also got an endorsement for a second term in office. -Advertisement- Governor Abiodun has done wonderful things in the health sector. He has built new hospitals and refurbished existing ones, making the state teaching hospitals world-class with the massive provision of facilities and the recruitment of specialists. Abiodun made Ogun an industrial hub with industries and estates springing up everywhere with good road networks, enabling environment peace and stability, and development is inevitable. For his impressive achievements, Abiodun emerged the Vanguard Governor of the Year. Recall that Daily Independent gave him the ICT Governor of the Year award. The New Telegraph previously honoured him. His life is one of achievements.
