The Federal Government in collaboration with the private sector and development partners at the just concluded 15th session of the Conference of Parties of the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD) has begun to strategise suitable financing mechanisms to revitalise degraded land in the country. The Federal Ministry of Environment in partnership with Fundactón Agreste and with the support of Prométhée and the “Kollektiv” consortium held a side event at CoP 15 with the theme “Scaling up degraded lands revitalisation through large-scale Land Degradation Neutrality (LDN) bankable investments and tracking progress on the ground from space” The meeting had in attendance officials from the Federal Ministry of Environment UNCCD, FAD, private sector players, Center for International Forestry Research (CIFOR) and Civil Society Organisations, among others. -Advertisement- The Minister of State for Environment, Sharon Ikeazor, noted that Nigeria is among the Great Green Wall countries (GGW) working towards building a wall of trees to stop the advancement of the Sahara desert Southward, adding that to achieve this, the country pledged to restore four million hectares of the landscape before 2030, and several regeneration projects are ongoing both at the national and sub-national levels. She stressed that to achieve the objectives of the GGW, investment by the government and the private sector in large scale bankable project is critical, adding that this informed the government’s decision to partner the private sector, non governmental organisations to facilitate the restoration efforts in the country. Ikeazor said: “To achieve LDM and meet Nigeria’s commitment to GGW objectives investment in large scale bankable projects by government and the private sector is critical, which is why the government is involving the private sector and NGOs to facilitate the restoration efforts. The funds required for the restoration is huge, hence, we need to explore different funding sources, government cannot do it alone.” She however acknowledged Green Sahara Farms and other private companies for their participation in ensuring government mobilise funds for the large scale restoration activities and efforts to raise awareness of available digital tools for monitoring of progress on the restoration programme on the ground from space. POLL The Managing Director of GSF, Suleiman Dikwa, during the first-panel discussion on “MEANS to achieve the GGW Acceleration” stressed the need for more awareness of the GGW in the Sahel region and the need to bring in business models that are suitable for the rural dwellers. The second-panel discussion on tools to achieve the GGW Acceleration” moderated by the GSF Managing Director emphasised on the deployment of satellites to monitor the progress made in achieving the GGW objectives. While disclosing plans by the Kolektiv to deploy the highway Satellite between 2024-2025, which would help scare people away from degrading forest that is being resuscitated because they will know the areas are being monitored from somewhere, the panellists also emphasised the need to use the satellite map and track activities on the ground. While explaining how trees can be used as collaterals to access loans by rural dwellers, one of the panelists, Mr Pokerson, explained that satellites are produced data and the data can be turned into actionable information and the asset of a smallholder farmer can be monitored from space and the images can be turned into maps. He further explained that humans as visual animals will make the maps to be easily understood and even the illiterates can easily understand the map of the satellite data and one can easily locate the trees, animals,” “If all this is put on an information system, the identity of the blockchain can be linked to a person and this will create a transparency and linkage with the asset on the ground and the person while making it difficult to manipulate this, will give the trust and confidence to the investors while at the same time giving the security to the person that the assets are protected.” On how the satellite can help monitor the four million hectares for land regeneration, that is not located together in the country and with neighbouring countries, one of the panelists, said: “We have the technology at our disposal and we can bring to the project what we want to do in the context of the GGW.” They stressed the need to have as many satellites as possible so as to get information, as the technology will help manage what is on the ground and to manage the destruction of the forest area.
