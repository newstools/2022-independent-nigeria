 AWKA – The Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer of the Anambra State Health Insurance Agency (ASHIA), Dr. Simeon Be­luonwu Onyemaechi says govern­ment will in the next four weeks establish ASHIA Drug Stores where ASHIA enrollees can ac­cess subsidised medications. Onyemaechi, who stated this during an exclusive interview with our correspondent in his office at Awka, maintained that the governor, Prof. Charles Chuk­wuma Soludo seeks to achieve Universal Health Coverage for Ndi-Anambra through health insurance schemes. He said that the drug stores would be managed by ASHIA pharmacists at designated pub­lic facilities to ensure that when a hospital cannot cope because of the rising cost of drugs, ASHIA enrollees will be referred to ASH­IA drug stores where they can get full value for the money they paid as premiums. He also said that government had tried the composite mech­anism of allowing hospitals to render services and provide drugs but since inflation rate in the country is taking a serious toll on the healthcare providers, ASHIA has taken the responsi­bility of providing the drugs at whatever cost for the benefit of her enrollees. The ASHIA boss further dis­closed that from July 4th this year, ASHIA would use the platforms of broadcast stations to obtain feedback as well as market the state health insurance scheme, adding that the aim was to en­sure quality assurance, serve as a redress mechanism and also spread the gospel of the state health insurance scheme as the target remained that within the next four years, ASHIA would have fully entrenched itself. Onyemaechi equally point­ed out that at the national level, there is National Health Insur­ance Act which he said makes it mandatory for every Nigerian to be enrolled in the scheme, stress­ing that it is now an offence not to have health insurance.
