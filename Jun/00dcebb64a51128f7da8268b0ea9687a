Deputy Speaker of the House of Representatives, Rt Hon Ahmed Idris Wase has congratulated Senator Bola Ahmed Tinubu on his emergence as the presidential candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC). In a statement issued by his Chief Press Secretary, Umar Muhammad Puma and made available to Daily Independent, Wase described the process that led to the emergence of Bola Tinubu as one of the most transparent in the country. “Your emergence in a transparent process is a testament to the fact that the APC is now more united and stronger and has sent a strong message about our resolve to bring about the desired national transformation needed to turn around the fortunes of our beloved country Nigeria. “By this convention and all the primary elections, we have demonstrated an uncommon desire to be different from the inefficiency and maladministration of the opposition PDP that has stunted our country’s march towards greatness. “I am confident that the APC that will emerge from the outcome of the primaries will be one that will inspire hope, harness our potential and lead us to prosperity,” the Deputy Speaker added. While calling for all hands to be on deck to ensure the success of the APC in the 2023 general elections, Wase commended all the aspirants who contested against Tinubu for their maturity and sportsmanship.
