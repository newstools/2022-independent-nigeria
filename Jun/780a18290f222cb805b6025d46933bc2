Chelsea are due to hold further talks with Raphinha’s agent Deco on Thursday as they look to see off any threat of a late move from Barcelona for the Brazilian. Chelsea have agreed a £55million fee with Leeds for Raphinha and hope to agree personal terms with a five-year contract worth around £120,000 a week. Deco, the former Portugal and Chelsea midfielder who represents Raphinha, was spotted at Barcelona’s offices on Wednesday and was reportedly making a final check to see if the Catalan club could match the offer on the table from Chelsea. Barcelona have reportedly raised £175m by selling a percentage of their media rights, which will allow them to spend on player transfers this summer. Barca’s late talks with Deco have raised the prospect of them hijacking the deal for Raphinha, who earlier this summer was thought to prefer a move to the Spanish giants. But Chelsea remain hopeful of sealing a deal for the 25-year-old. They want Raphinha to form a new-look attack with Raheem Sterling at Stamford Bridge next season. A move to Chelsea would see Raphinha triple his wages, which have not increased since he joined Leeds in 2020. Chelsea have also opened talks over Sterling as they bid to rebuild their attack after Romelu Lukaku completed his loan move to Inter Milan. -Advertisement- POLL New Chelsea owners Todd Boehly and Clearlake Capital have promised Thomas Tuchel at least six new signings this summer.
