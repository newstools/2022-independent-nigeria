ABUJA – The National Hajj Commission of Nigeria (NAHCON) has announced the fare for the 2022 Hajj exercise, pegging it at N2.4 million per head, a statement by the commission has said. The release issued by an Assistant Direc­tor, Public Affairs in the commission, Fatima Sanda Usara, noted that NAHCON boss, Zikril­lah Kunle Hassan, made the announcement indicating slight variations in fares payable by states. According to the statement, “Nigerian pil­grims for 2022 Hajj from Southern Nigeria are to pay N2,496,815.29 while their counterparts from Northern part of the country will pay N2, 449, 607.89. -Advertisement- “For Adamawa and Borno states, they are to pay N2, 408, 197.89 due to proximity to Saudi Arabia.” “The air ticket cost is the major difference in the Hajj fare,” the commission’s Chairman said on Saturday at an extraordinary meeting with Chief Executives of Muslim Pilgrims’ Welfare Boards in the NAHCON Hajj House headquarters in Abuja. The statement noted that the announce­ment drew a standing ovation from State Pil­grims’ Welfare Boards’ Executive Officers and other participants who commended the com­mission for “a job well done in holding down the Hajj fare below N2.5 million deposit despite the obvious challenges”. The statement further quoted Alhaji Kunle Hassan as reminding the gathering that “all stakeholders do not have the luxury of time and from experience, we know that Saudi Ara­bia will not add an hour extra once the dead­line for landing is due”. He disclosed that the “Commission has requested for more Hajj seats, but NAHCON is still waiting for response. Therefore, in the meantime, all states are to work with and ex­haust the allocations they have been granted instead of waiting for more”.
