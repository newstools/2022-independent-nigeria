A Senior Advocate of Nigeria, Ebun-Olu Adegboruwa,(SAN), has lauded the decision of the Northern governors elected on the platform of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) recommending zoning of the party’s presidential ticket to the South. In a statement on Saturday night titled ‘APC ON THE PATH OF HISTORY and made available to Daily Independent, Adegboruwa said the decision of the northern governors has rekindled the quest for unity in the country. He however said the opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) is enmeshed in a game of death by flouting its Constitution on zoning and settling for a Northern candidate. -Advertisement- He said “I receive with joy and enthusiasm the decision of Northern Governors of the All Progressive Congress recommending zoning of the presidency to the Southern part of Nigeria in 2023, after eight years of the administration of President Muhammadu Buhari. This is the way to go”. “The Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria in section 14(3) stipulates equal distribution of power amongst all the sections of the country”. “Being the party in power, the decision of APC Governors has rekindled the quest for unity amongst the contending forces in Nigeria”. “It is disappointing that the Peoples Democratic Party is currently enmeshed in a dance of death by going against its own Constitution on power rotation”. “I urge APC to conduct a transparent primary election in choosing its presidential flag bearer in furtherance of the decision of the Governors and to match this resolution with their votes in the general elections so that it is not just a political statement. God bless Nigeria”.
