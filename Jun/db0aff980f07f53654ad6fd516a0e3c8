This festival celebrates children’s day in a fun and loving environment which includes learning and building bridges with varieties of activities such as symposium, skills orientation, cultural parades and many other exciting programs.We also used this opportunity to address some issues of the society to the children for example child abuse, rape, examination malpractices and crimes in general. We brought in dignitaries to lecture them, such as The Chief Justice of Lagos, NDLEA Lagos Chairman, NAFDAC Lagos Director, NSCDC Lagos Commandant and Commanding Legion Officer Division 11. They all did justice to each topic said to the children,” he stated.Lectures given to the children were ‘Roles of Citizens in Security’ by Major E.A Sam, The Commanding Officer, Nigerian Legion 11th Division, ‘Food Safety’ by NAFDAC Official Omiyi Gregory, ‘Success Tips For Schools’ by PRO NSCDC, ASCI Abolurin Oluwaseun and lastly ‘Being Yourself’ by Justice Sherifat Sholebo representing Chief Justice Of Lagos.Highlights of the event were cultural dance choreography, dance competitions, musical talent displays and award presentations.
