The lawmaker representing Nasarawa North, Godiya Akwashiki, has dumped the All Progressives Congress. It was learned that Akwashiki resigned from the ruling party during the inauguration of the construction of Nasarawa Eggon/ Galle road, in Nassarawa Eggon Local Government Area of the state, on Monday. Akwashiki, while stating the reason behind his decision to dump APC, cited the alleged doctoring of the delegates’ list. The lawmaker said, “You are all aware of what transpired during the APC primary election in Akwanga. I withdrew from the race because delegates’ lists were doctored by the party. I have been under pressure from you to leave the party, and today, I have answered your call to leave APC and actualize my re-election ambition. “In the next 72 hours, you will see a platform that I will join, and we will all move together.” The ruling party has seen some of its lawmakers dump the party over their failure to clinch the party’s ticket ahead of the 2023 general elections.APC, in the past few days, has taken steps to stop the decamping of lawmakers. Still, the move seems unproductive, with Akwashiki set to join another party to actualize his re-election ambition.
