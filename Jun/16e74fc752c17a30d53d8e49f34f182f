***Labels Him “Treacherous Judas“ LAGOS – Nigerian lawyer, author and human rights activist, Reno Omokri has taken a bold swipe at the Vice President, Prof. Yemi Osinbajo, labeling him a treacherous Judas. According to Omokri in a tweet on his official twitter handle, @renoomokri, he has no sympathy for Yemi Osinbajo because he betrayed the former governor of Lagos state and APC chieftain, Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu, who is also a presidential aspirant. While describing Osinbajo a betrayal, he noted that the vice president has never won any election on his own without the support of Tinubu. He wrote, “I have no sympathy for Osinbajo. A treacherous Judas of a pastor! Someone nominated you to stand in for him, you went there to stand in for yourself? You? What election have you won on your own in your life without the help of Tinubu? I may dislike Tinubu. But I respect loyalty!” See tweet below;
