LAGOS – Ogun State government, through its Ministry of Envi­ronmen, is set to join the rest of the world to celebrate the 2022 World Environment Day. This year’s celebration, the 50th edition, is marked world­wide on June 5 every year to draw attention to issues affect­ing the environment. The theme for this year’s celebration, ‘Only One Earth’ is said to be a call for collec­tive transformation action on a global scale to celebrate, protect and restore the planet and common home. -Advertisement- The celebration is a call to a practical guide to living sustainably in harmony with nature. Ola Oresanya, Special Ad­viser to the Governor on En­vironment, while speaking on the line-up of activities to mark the day in Ogun State, described the theme as so unique to the state as the in­dustrial hub of the nation and the West Africa sub-region. He said the consciousness for protection of the fragile ecosystem formed the bed­rock of the state’s conviction and commitment to promo­tion of environmental best practices while living sustain­ably in harmony with nature. He said the Ogun State government would host this year’s celebration on Tuesday June 7, while the events lined up for the celebration would include awards in different categories to industries for promotion of global best practices in responsible production and the manage­ment of environment. He noted that the awards would also reward deserv­ing industries for carbon emission reduction, pro­motion of circular economy, pollution control, response to regulatory feedbacks and readiness to mitigate identi­fied gaps. POLL The event, according to him, would hold at the Banquet Hall of the June 12 Cultural Centre, Kuto, Abeokuta, with a lecture titled, ‘Living Sustainably in Harmony with Nature, Curbing the Menace of Cli­mate Change Biodiversity Loss and Plastic Waste’.
