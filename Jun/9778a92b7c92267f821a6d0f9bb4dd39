An Abuja resident Amira Safiyanu, who raised a false alarm of her abduction in Abuja is to be arraigned in court today. According to the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) Police Command on Tuesday Safiyanu, also known by her Twitter handle: @Ameerah_Sufyan will be arraigned in the Wuse Magistrate Court. The FCT Police spokesperson, DSP Josephine Adeh noted that the 300-level student of Ahmadu Bello University, ABU, Zaria will be conveyed away from the command to court. “Amera Safiyanu will be arraigned in Wuse Magistrate court tomorrow. She will be leaving the Command by 9:00 am,” the police said on Tuesday. Recall that Amira came on Twitter on June 14 to raise a false alarm that she and 16 other persons including three pregnant women were kidnapped. Her tweets came as a shock to many as she claimed her abductors wore police uniforms and that they came to the homes of their victims to abduct them. She was later found and then she apologized for misleading the public. She claimed she went into the bush and decided to dehydrate and starve herself.
