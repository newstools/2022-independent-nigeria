ABUJA – Corps Marshal of the Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC), Dr. Boboye Oyeyemi, has described Performance Management System (PMS) as a pace-setting system that distinguishes se­rious and forward looking or­ganisations aspiring to reach the pinnacle in a 21st century competitive world. Oyeyemi stated this in Abuja during a Public Service Lecture with the theme, “Performance Management System: Impact on Productivity,” he delivered in commemoration of the 2022 Civil Service Day. According to him, PMS clearly articulates the vision, goals and objectives of an or­ganisation and stipulates ways of achieving them via strategic focus, without undermining human resource capacity as a key variable to their realisation. He said PMS seeks to achieve a well-defined job description and specification for each in­dividual to do his/ her own bit for the overall realisation of an organisation’s strategic quest. Boboye reiterated the major role civil service plays in gover­nance, as civil servants are sad­dled with the implementation of government’s policies, pro­grammes and activities that are instrumental to the well-being of the citizenry. He maintained that, to ef­fectively carry out such tasks, government structures need to adopt strategic approaches to service delivery, insisting that the continuous improve­ment Nigerians yearn for, can be attained through appraisal of the current situation by or­ganisations, which will guide in charting a new course for development.
