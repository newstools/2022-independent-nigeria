LAGOS – Member representing Iseyin/Itesiwaju/Kajola/Iwajowa at the House of Representatives, Hon. Shina Peller has revealed why he refused to contest for a second term at the lower house. According to Peller who made the revelation in a series of tweets on his official twitter handle @ShinaPeller, his decision to bow out after a tenure at the lower house is to allow other local governments produce a candidate for the slot. He wrote, “Many people wonder why I chose not to return to the House of Representatives for the second term. For the sake of integrity, my decision is based on my consideration of other local governments within my constituency- Kajola and Iwajowa who haven’t presented a representative for almost 16 years now. Returning to the House for the second term will mean denying them the opportunity to present a representative for twenty years.” -Advertisement- “By 2023 when I will be completing my first term as a member of the House of Representatives, it will make it sixteen (16) uninterrupted years that Iseyin/Itesiwaju have been producing representatives for the constituency leaving out the people from Kajola/Iwajowa.” “My people from Kajola/Iwajowa feel the people from Iseyin haven’t been fair enough to them in this regard, and I share their pain.” “This was why I made up my mind to throw my weight behind choosing a qualified person from Kajola/Iwajowa to represent our federal constituency in 2023, while I am yielding the call of my people from Oke Ogun to opt for the Oyo North Senatorial District seat.” “And I cannot be seen leading the liberation of Okeogun people and not fair to the local govts within my Constituency.” “So, to those that feel I should return to the House of Reps, it’s not all about me alone; it’s about putting into consideration my integrity and overall interest of all.” POLL See tweets below; https://twitter.com/ShinaPeller/status/1532380095104569344?s=20&t=ZLFPxEu97WN2tvHLoExZ9w
