Crystal Palace have announced the signing of highly-rated Derby County winger Malcolm Ebiowei on a five-year deal. The Athletic reported on Friday that Palace had completed a deal for the 18-year-old, who will join on July 1 upon the expiry of his Derby contract. He will become Palace’s second signing of the window, after goalkeeper Sam Johnstone also signed for the club as a free agent, agreeing a four-year deal. It is also understood that Palace are increasingly confident that they can secure a deal with Lens for midfielder Cheick Doucoure, with personal terms not expected to be an issue. In 2021-22, Ebiowei made 16 Championship appearances for Wayne Rooney’s team, scoring once and assisting twice for a team that was fighting relegation due to their 21-point deduction last season. On signing for Palace, Ebiowei said: “I’d like to thank everyone at Derby County for their incredible support over the last year or so, and for giving me the opportunity to show what I can do on the field, and I’d also like to thank the fans for their encouragement especially given the circumstances of last season. “As everyone is aware the situation is very uncertain at Derby, so it was important for me to secure my long-term future. “I’m incredibly excited about the prospect of joining Palace, as they have an incredible squad and huge potential. I very much hope to contribute positively to the team this season.” -Advertisement- POLL Steve Parish, Palace chairman, added: “I’m delighted that Malcolm has chosen Crystal Palace as the best place to continue his development, following his impressive breakthrough into senior football in recent months. “He is a highly coveted young player, and we very much expect to provide a platform for him to flourish at the highest level.” Palace are preparing to return for pre-season training on June 27.
