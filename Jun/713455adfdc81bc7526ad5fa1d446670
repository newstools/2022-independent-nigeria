With 24 hours to the crucial 2023 Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) qualifying match between the Super Eagles and the Leone Stars of Sier­ra Leone, ex-international Taiwo Oloyede has urged the Super Eagles to avoid the mistake of past encoun­ter against the Leone Stars. Recall that the last time both teams met was in 2021 Africa Cup of Nations (AF­CON) qualifying matches with both legs ending in draws. The Leone Stars came from the dead to level a 4-0 deficit in the first leg in Benin City before they played out a barren draw on November 17, 2020 in Free Town. Oloyede said: “By now, players and officials of the Super Eagles should know that there are no longer min­nows in football. They should avoid the mistakes of the 2021 AFCON qualifiers. “It has always been said that in football, it is not over until it is over. They must play to the whistle of the ref­eree irrespective of the situ­ation in the match. “They should see the match as if they are playing France, Brazil, Argentina or Italy. They must also try to win the match in order to re­deem their image at the last AFCON in Cameroon and their failure to qualify for the forthcoming Qatar 2022 FIFA World Cup. “And also the defeats suf­fered in the hands of Mexico and Ecuador in their last in­ternational friendly match­es. Moreso, victory over the Leone Stars would send jit­ters down the spine of ‘The Falcons and True Parrots’of São Tomé and Príncipe at the 45,000-capacity Grand Stade de Agadir in southern Mo­rocco,” said Oloyede.
