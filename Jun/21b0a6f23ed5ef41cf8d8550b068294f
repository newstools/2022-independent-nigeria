Due to the appearance of their leader, Mazi Nnamdi Kanu in court on Tuesday, the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) has declared Tuesday another sit-at-home in the Southeast. In a statement on Monday by its spokesman, Emma Powerful, IPOB said, “We normally announce last time that any day our leader will appear in court everybody will solidarize with our leader Mazi Nnamdi KANU. “Therefore, tomorrow (today -Tuesday) will be sit-ay-home in Igbo land and other areas where Ndigbo resides.” Meanwhile, the normal Monday sit-at-home in the zone still kept residents indoors as banks, markets, shops, and other commercial activities closed in Anambra and other States.
