The Lagos State Government has urged Unions in the transport sector to co-operate with the Government as it is mutually beneficial in achieving set goals. Dr. Frederic Oladeinde, Commissioner for Transportation, gave this charge when the leadership of the Nigeria Association of Road Transport Owners (NARTO) and Maritime Workers Union of Nigeria (MWUM) which are bodies that collaborate on the sea and dry port terminal trucking activities across the country paid him a courtesy visit. Oladeinde who noted that the State Government is not unaware of the challenges faced in the sector added that the Sanwo-Olu administration is going the whole haul in ensuring ease of doing business in the sector. While commending the Lagos State Government on the roles played at reducing the spate of extortion drastically at the ports, Mr. Aloga Ogbogbo, the Executive Secretary of the Nigeria Association of Road Transport Owners, expressed the displeasure of the Unions on the activities of miscreants at the ports, noting that they hinder the smooth operations of the truckers. Allaying the worries, the Transport Commissioner disclosed that the State Government has been working with the Truck Transit Park (TTP) and the Nigerian Port Authorities (NPA) to ease all encumbrances affecting the smooth run of the ports. He added that relentless efforts are being made towards an improved E-Call Up System.
