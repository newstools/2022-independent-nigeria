Foremost prosecutors of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) Wahab Shittu and Rotimi Oyedepo were among the 129 lawyers shortlisted by the Legal Practitioners’ Privileges Committee (LPPC) for the conferment of the rank of Senior Advocate of Nigeria (SAN) in 2022. The list which was published pursuant to paragraph 12 subsection 2 and 20 of the legal practitioners’ privileges committee guidelines of 2018 has 73 practising lawyers and 56 academic applicants. Other names on the list are, the son of the First Republic Senate President, Orji Nwafor-Orizu; son of former Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Ikani Kanu Agabi among others. A statement accompanying the list made by the chief registrar of the Supreme Court, who doubles as the Secretary of the LPPC, Hajo Sarki-Bello said the shortlist comprised candidates who passed through the advocate filtration stages and academic pre-qualification exercise. The statement further says “the general public is at liberty to comment on the integrity, reputation, and competence of the above applicants”. “However, any complaint(s) presented to the legal practitioners’ privileges committee must be accompanied with a verifying affidavit deposed to before a court of record in Nigeria.” Sarki-Bello asked members of the public who have any such comments on any of the candidates to make the same before 4 pm on July 18 with 20 copies of such complaints in line with the guidelines.
