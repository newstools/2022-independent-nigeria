The Guild further observed that the hierarchy of the Nigerian Army is determined to enhance the welfare of the soldiers, “which is very important to the COAS’s blueprint in the promotion of rank and file, the posting and those at the war-front is also a major concern to the leadership, compensating the families left behind by soldiers who lost their lives in battlefront to safeguard and protect the nation. ” The vision of the COAS in preaching peace, professionalism and submission to democratic ethos, the Guild noted, “is now the agenda on every soldier’s heart and that’s why the Nigerian Army is doing all it can to ‘weed out’ disloyal and political officers who are determined to derail the plans of the military hierarchy. ” GOCMEJ whole-heartedly supports the COAS in ‘flushing out’ soldiers that have divided loyalty, whose main sources of income are questionable and who are not loyal to the military established rules and guidelines.
