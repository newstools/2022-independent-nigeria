 LAGOS – The Deputy Governor of Edo State, Rt. Hon. Philipa Shaibu, has expressed his felicitations with the Man­aging Director of Nilayo Sports Marketing Limited, Chief Adebukola Olopade, and his wife on their instal­lation as the Osi Asoju Oba and Erelu Osi Asoju Oba of Egbaland respectively. In his letter of felicita­tion dated June 23, 2022, the deputy governor said the auspicious occasion had brought Chief Adebukola Olopade into the class of some of the highly respect­ed chiefs in the palace of the Alake, the paramount ruler of Egbaland, Ogun State. “No doubt, His Royal Majesty, Oba Adedotun Gbadebo must have singled both of you out for these honours because of your modest, but uncommon contribution to the devel­opment and growth of the ancient city of Abeokuta and indeed, Ogun State. “Aside being a two-term Commissioner for Youth and Sports in your native land of Ogun State, your ex­ploits in the areas of sports administration cum sports marketing in Nigeria are quite commendable,” said the deputy governor. He further said that Ol­opade remained a shining example to this generation in this regard and he be­lieved the honour as the Osi Asoju Oba of Egbaland would further people him to do more for Ogun State, Ni­geria and indeed humanity.
