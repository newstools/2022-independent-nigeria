Fertilizer prices in Nigeria rose by almost 100% Y-o-Y according to surveys by Daily Trust, Vetiva has reported. Vetiva said that urea fertilizer from companies like Dangote and Indorama currently sells between N19, 000 and N22, 000. “With the wet season planting posing a problem of water control on farms, an inadequate supply of fertilizer would cause significantly low productions of farm produce. The survey showed that the price of fertilizer has increased across the major producers in Nigeria it added.” It noted that prices of Commodities should not see a wholesale turn in movement as oil is not expected to trend higher after Indonesia stopped the ban placed on oil palm exports and that “Cocoa bean prices could be set for an increase as major producers and exporters push to form a coalition on price determination to force the price up to $400 per ton”.
