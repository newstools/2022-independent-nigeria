LAGOS  – One of Africa’s leading financial, human capital management and e-commerce technology giant, SystemSpecs, has said that small and medium-sized businesses need to adopt electronic payments in order to scale up. According to Demola Igbalajobi, Managing Director of SystemSpecs Technology, a SystemSpecs subsidiary, the role played by electronic payments in the growth and success of SMEs in Africa cannot be overemphasized. Igalajobi was speaking during a panel session tagged ‘Navigating the Challenges of Payment Gateways: What’s the way out for SMEs ,’ at the 2022 Lagos Leather Fair, held recently in Lagos. The Lagos Leather Fair is an initiative that seeks to showcase West Africa’s leading leather brands. Prominent guests at the event include the honourable Minister for Industry, Trade and Investment, Otunba Adeniyi Adebayo; Managing Partner and Co-Founder of Alitheia Capital, Tokunboh Ishameal; Senior Manager, Intra-African Trade Initiative, AFREXIM Bank, Temwa Gondwe; and Executive Director, FATE Foundation, Adenike Adeyemi, amongst several others. The conversation in the panel session was designed to unravel, discuss and highlight the causes of the pressing issues that SMEs face with effectively conducting cross-border business transactions; as well as to educate audiences on the dynamics of the ever-evolving digital payments space. “For the African market, one thing that has happened over the last few years is the recognition that we have to solve the problems the African way for Africans. For businesses the first thing is to go online and get payment gateways that allow you transact internationally.”
