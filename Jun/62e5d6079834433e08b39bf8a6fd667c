EKITI  – Hundreds of members of the pan-Yoruba organisation, Oo­dua People’s Congress, stormed Ado-Ekiti, the Ekiti State capi­tal, to honour one of their lead­ers and Coordinator, Prince Adeniyi Adedipe who was con­ferred with the Asiwaju Oodua of Ekiti State by the National Secretariat of the group. In his remarks, the National President, Prince Ogboni Asi­bote condemned the gruesome killings of innocent worship­pers in Owo, Ondo State. Asibote disclosed that the leadership of the body had in­terfaced with the governors of the region to partner the body to be able to work with other security personnel to maintain security of lives and property. He said, “The OPC is for Yoruba and it was formed to protect the interest of Yoruba. But politicians are causing a lot of problems for us. Those in government knew what was happening. They wanted to destabilise the organisation for their own selfish interest by dividing us. “But we can’t allow our peo­ple to be killed; we are going to help. The government must engage us, but they should let us know their agenda. Nobody has the interest of Yoruba more than us. “We have seen the governors of Ekiti and Ondo states and we have recommended what they needed to do to curb these senseless attacks. It is now left to them to take appropriate steps. Our government must be on their feet.” Speaking with journalists shortly after the conferment, Adedipe who thanked OPC members for honouring him with their presence also ex­pressed deep appreciation to the candidate of the All Pro­gressives Congress in the June 18, 2022 poll, Biodun Abayomi Oyebanji (BAO). Adedipe said the ruling par­ty had been according the party recognition and that accounted for why the national body of OPC, led by its National Pres­ident, Prince Ogboni Asibote , mobilised to Ekiti to support APC.
