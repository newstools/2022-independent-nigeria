The Sports Writers Association of Nigeria (SWAN), Lagos State Chapter has demanded an unreserved apology from the management of Shooting Stars Sports Club (3SC) following a brutal attack on her members at the Lekan Salami Stadium, Ibadan on Wednesday. Findings revealed that three journalists, Mr Tobi Samuel Adepoju, Mr Ayo Animasaun and Miss Atinuke Esan were assaulted after the 3SC and Remo Stars’ NPFL game. However, Lagos SWAN Chairman, Debo Oshundun, in a statement wants the Ibadan-based club to write an apology letter and also replace the damaged items of the victims in the next 48-hours. -Advertisement- Oshundun frowned at the act of subjecting journalists to such traumatizing situations while carrying out their professional duties. “We are partners in progress with sports development bodies in Nigeria but we have zero tolerance towards our members being brutalized. “The management of 3SC as matter of fact should apologize to victims in writing within the next 48 hours and also ensure their damaged equipment is replaced,” Lagos SWAN said. Oshundun also called on the club management to ensure that the perpetrators are fished out and brought to book. He, however, urges the LMC to sanction 3SC for unsportsmanlike conduct to serve as a deterrent to others.
