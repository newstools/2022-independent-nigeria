Contrary to the position of most Northern Governors on the power shift to the South, the National Chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Senator Abdullahi Adamu on Monday announced Senate President Ahmad Lawan as the party’s consensus candidate. Adamu who is the former Governor of Nasarawa State made the announcement at the meeting of the National Working Committee (NWC) on Monday ahead of the presidential primary election. However, a member of the NWC who pleaded anonymity said that such was not adopted by the NWC as the committee kicked against the choice of Lawan and insisted on a level playing ground for other presidential aspirants. -Advertisement- The source said, “Yes, it’s true the chairman announced it but it was not discussed or adopted by the NWC. “He just announced it as his personal opinion. Such can not stand.” Adamu’s decision to adopt Lawan as a consensus candidate came barely 48 hours after 11 APC northern governors endorsed that power must return to the South after President Muhammadu Buhari’s tenure. “After careful deliberation, we wish to state our firm conviction that after eight years in the office of President Muhammadu Buhari, the presidential candidate of the APC for the 2023 elections should be one of our teeming members from the southern states of Nigeria,” the governors had said.
