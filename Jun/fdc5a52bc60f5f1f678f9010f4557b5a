Kwara State Gov­ernor AbdulRah­man AbdulRazaq has congratulated Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinu­bu on his emergence as the presidential candidate of the governing All Progres­sives Congress (APC) in the next year’s ballot. The Governor described the emergence of Asiwaju as truly deserving, saying the ballot represents a resounding vote of confi­dence by the largest major­ity of party faithfuls and leaders in his capacity to lead the party to another victory. “It was a moment to speak to the direction the party must take to consoli­date on its own wins, build on the many successes of President Muhammadu Bu­hari, and raise a dynamic successor team that is able to take up the challenges of nation-building and devel­opment in a peculiar age of changing metrics of gover­nance and collective securi­ty. In antecedence, capacity, and reach, there is no doubt that Asiwaju ticks all the right boxes. With his emer­gence, our party is clearly destined for a big win in the next general elections,” the Governor said. “I therefore congratulate and commend His Excellen­cy President Muhammadu Buhari for showing a good example in bequeathing to the party and the country a flag bearer and successor in a befittingly democratic way. This is a new height in party politics and inter­nal democracy in Nigeria and Africa. “I equally commend my brothers-Progressive Gov­ernors, especially from the North, for standing up and being counted when it mattered most in the life of our party. History will not forget that singular stand that shows our love for our country and its co­hesion.” The Governor also com­mended the party lead­ership as well as all the aspirants for their great efforts and statesmanship as the curtain is drawn on the APC presidential pri­maries.
