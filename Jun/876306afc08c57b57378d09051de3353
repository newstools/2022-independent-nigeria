ABUJA – Former President Goodluck Jonathan has pleaded with Nigerians not to play Politics with the 2014 National Constitutional Conference report if the country is to come out of its present malaise. He particularly urged the two chambers of the Nigerian parliament to dispassionately look at the recommendation of the confab with a view to implementing them instead of allowing it gather dust like other well-meaning efforts at governance and development of the country. Represented by Senator Anyim Pius Anyim, former Secretary of the Government of the Federation at the presentation of ” The National Question”, a book authored by two veteran journalists James Akpanudedehe and Sam Akpe, with focus on the 2014 confab, Jonathan said that it was in the interest of the country and generations unborn to implement the constitutional Conference report. He decried situation where every important issue in the country, including its security, economy, even issues that are in the National interest of the country are subjected to unnecessary politics. He blamed this for the failure of the APC administration to peruse the confab report with a view to implementing it. Explaining why his administration could not initiate action towards the implementation of the Report, the former president said that he had little or no time to implement the report which he said would require the tinkering of the constitution. Worse still he said the then speaker of the House of Representatives, Aminu Tambowal had atCross carpeted to the All Progressives Congress (APC), making it difficult to approach the national assembly with anything that would tinker the constitution, especially that the intention of his government had come under serious suspicious and scrutiny. Jonathan commended the book authors, Sam Akpe and James Akpadem, who served as Media Officer of the conference, for documenting the experience of the 2014 confab for posterity.
