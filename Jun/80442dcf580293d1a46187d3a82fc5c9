 DAMATURU. – Small and Medium Enter­prise Development Agency (SMEDAN) today organized a one day National Agri-Prenu­ership Training at the Federal Secretariat Conference hall, Damaturu. The participants were drawn from the 16 coop­erative society empowered with N300,000 last year by the agency. Speaking to newsmen short­ly after the training, the Yobe State Manager SMEDAN Bu­lama Yusuf said that they gath­ered those that last year bene­fited the sum of N300,000 each from the Agency to make farm­ing business to get feedback on how far they have gone with the grant. “We want to hear update and progress made so far and their challenges”. According to him “we draw their attention of the 16 coop­erative society in Yobe State whom we empowered with a grant where each beneficiary received N300,000 it does not stop here because is a nation­wide programme”. He further disclosed that the project does not stop here as other programs are upcom­ing but more of Agricultural empowerment “there are so many programs targeting poor and vulnerable commu­nities, we would continue to train them on the proper use of the grant, the agency is thinking of giving them out materials and tools in the next phase instead of the grant, this includes fertilizer, chemical, equipment and others farm implements”.
