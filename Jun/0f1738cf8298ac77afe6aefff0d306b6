LAGOS – Eze Okechukwu Anorue, the Babaloja Tejuosho Ultra-modern Market Phase 2, has debunked the allegation doing the round on the social media in which Chief Folashade Tnubu-Ojo, Iyaloja-General of Nigeria, made a disparaging comment about Igbo people. Speaking in an interview with Daily Independent on Sunday, he said he spoke with Tinubu-Ojo on the matter and she “categorically denied making the alleged comment, describing it as a lie from the pit of hell.” Anorue, who is the Eze-Igbo 1 of Igbogbo/Baiyeku Kingdom in Lagos State, stated that the Iyaloja General of Nigeria said that the write was the work of people who want to ruin her name and cause friction between the Igbo people and their hosts in the state. Anorue, who served as a two-term president emeritus of the lmo State Town Development Association in Lagos State, posited that Tinubu-Ojo claimed that the authors of the article want to use it to damage the political aspirations of her father. The Babaloja of Tejuosho Ultra-modern Market Phase 2 said the Iyaloja General of Nigeria added that those who know would testify that she is not the type of person who will make such a comment. He added that market people in Nigeria stated that she believes that everyone has the right to vote according to their conscience, adding that she urged people to register so that they can vote in the elections. However, Anorue urged Igbo people across the country to obtain their voter cards quietly like others and do so without drama, adding that they should respect their hosts and guide their utterances.
