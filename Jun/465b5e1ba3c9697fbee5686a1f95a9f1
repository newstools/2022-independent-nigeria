Both sides expressed concerns about the evolving situation in Europe, particularly the spillover effect of the Ukraine crisis, and agreed that countries in East Asia should boost strategic communication, strengthen unity and coordination, and join hands in safeguarding the hard-won peace and development. China and Malaysia believed that regional countries should safeguard the mature cooperation framework with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean) at the center, and try to prevent the Cold War mentality from taking root in this region to create a new camp confrontation. They hope that other major countries could play a constructive role in maintaining peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific region. Wang visited the Solomon Islands, Kiribati, Samoa, Fiji, Tonga, Vanuatu and Papua New Guinea as well as Timor-Leste.
