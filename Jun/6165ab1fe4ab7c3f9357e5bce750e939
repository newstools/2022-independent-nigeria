The Maritime Workers’ Union of Nigeria (MWUN), has expressed its worries over continued denial of Nigeria’s Certificate of Competency (CoC) by some flags. Comrade Adewale Adeyanju, President General of MWUN, who expressed this, called on the relevant Maritime agencies to gear up efforts at making the Nigeria’s flag a global acceptance. The MWUN boss also called on the Federal Government to put machinery in place to strengthen the nation’s training institutions to make them at par with global standard demands. His words: “We find it expedient at this time to announce our worry at the continued denial of our certificate of competency by certain flag states which limits the application of our seafaring competency in other clime. We therefore posit that government and its responsible agency pull up to gear up our acceptance in the global space. “We also seize this opportunity to call on government to put machinery on ground to strengthen our maritime training institution to bring them to par with global standards.” Earlier, the maritime union boss felicitated with global seafarers even as he lauded the professionals for their global impact on world economy. “I, on behalf of the leadership of the maritime workers union of Nigeria do hereby felicitate with seafarers in Nigeria and globally. “We do this with a deep understanding of the extraordinary services seafarers provide to keep the world economy running smoothly.”
