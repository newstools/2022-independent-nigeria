LAGOS – The scheduled trial of An­drew Ominnikoron, the driver, of Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) who allegedly raped and murdered a 22-year old fashion designer, Oluwabam­ise Ayanwole, was on Wednes­day stalled due to the ban of commercial motorcycles pop­ularly known as Okada. Recall that the Lagos State Governor, Babajide San­wo-Olu, had on May 18, 2022, announced a total ban on the operations of commercial motorcycles, also known as okada, in six local govern­ment areas in the state with effect from June 1, 2022. Following the development and the planned protest by the Okada riders, the Controller of Prisons Adebisi Adewale, directed a temporary suspen­sion of conveying inmates to various courts in the state due to intelligence and security re­ports of possible breakdown of law and order during the protest. -Advertisement- At the resumed hearing of the case before Justice Sheri­fat Sonaike, of the Lagos High Court, sitting at Tafawa Bale­wa Square, the defendant was not produced. The Director of Public Prosecutions, Dr. Babajide Martins, after announcing his appearance, informed the court that the prisons service did not bring the inmates to court due to security reasons over the Okada ban. Martins said, “I don’t think the defendant’s coun­sel, Abayomi Omotubora, is here and the Correctional Service did not bring inmates to court because of the Oka­da ban and security reasons, but we have three witnesses in court. “The second prosecution witness (PW2), who needs to finish giving his evidence, and two other witneses are in court. I humbly request that today’s date be vacated and adjourned to other dates that has already been fixed.”
