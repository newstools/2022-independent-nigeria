No fewer than 77 out of 2,156 persons tested HIV positive during mass test conducted by Taraba State Agency for Control of AIDS. The mass testing and treatment project in the state was to ensure a HIV free society in Taraba State by 2030. The director-general of the agency, Dr Garba Danjuma made the disclosure during the weekly review of the performance of the implementation partners working across HIV, tuberculosis, orphans and vulnerable children (OVC) in the state.

During our mass testing and treatment project over the weekend, only 77 persons were confirmed positive for the virus out of 2,156 tested across 16 local governments areas of the state. We tested 359 children of between 0-14 years old. The 76 out of the 77 victims have already been linked for treatment with various health facilities across the state,” the DG said.
