Just when you thought it was safe to mention Alfredo Morelos again, new speculation has emerged linking Villarreal with an interest in the Rangers icon. The 2021 Europa League winners, the yellow submarines, have a prominence and an appeal which would likely resonate with the Colombian – on the back of their seventh place finish in La Liga, last season. Following on from the much heralded links to Sevilla, now Marca has stated that a familiar opponent has come into contention: “Alfredo Morelos, between Sevilla and Villarreal? The Colombian is the target of two of the important teams in La Liga, although Premier League clubs are also bidding hard to get his services” “But very close in the forecasts appear two teams from the noble zone of Spanish football. Monchi (Sevilla DoF) has set his sights on the Colombian striker, who could follow in the footsteps of Luis Muriel or Carlos Bacca. Unai Emery’s Yellow Submarine also has Morelos in its portfolio. It is the third on the list.” Credibility As that last line relates to, this speculation comes in terms of betting odds in Spain so that has to be taken into consideration as much as the interest can’t immediately be ruled out. In terms of making headlines and mentions in the Spanish press, why would there be such a focus on a player based in Scotland without substance. The apparent interest from Sevilla, whilst it hasn’t yet resulted in a bid at Ibrox, continues to grow. -Advertisement- POLL Recent talk of €8 million for Alfredo Morelos won’t be entertained by Rangers chiefs, especially if dealing with prominent Spanish clubs. The truth will emerge soon enough.
