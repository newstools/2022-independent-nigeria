Ukraine has granted citizenship to Alexander Nevzorov, a prominent Russian journalist and a Kremlin critic who fled Moscow with his wife after denouncing the Russian invasion of Ukraine. A Moscow court ordered the arrest in absentia of Nevzorov, accusing him of spreading false information about what Moscow portrays as its “special military operation” in Ukraine. He and his wife fled Russia in March. Anton Gerashchenko, an adviser to the Ukrainian interior minister, said authorities in the capital Kyiv had granted citizenship to Nevzorov and his wife, Lydia. -Advertisement- Nevzorov confirmed he received Ukrainian citizenship in a statement on Telegram messenger, in which he said Russia’s war was a crime and Ukraine its victim. “I take the side of the victim. And I am damn grateful to those tormented, desperate, bloodied people of Ukraine who allowed me to take my place among them,” he said. Russia launched an investigation against Nevzorov, whose YouTube channel has more than 1.8 million subscribers, over statements he made that criticised the Russian armed forces for deliberately shelling a maternity hospital in the Ukrainian city of Mariupol. “I can’t be silent any more. What’s happening in Mariupol is terrorism,” he wrote on his Telegram channel, referring to two weeks of bombardment and shelling of the Sea of Azov port city. Kremlin-controlled media have said Russian troops are “liberating” Ukraine from ultra-nationalists and “neo-Nazis”. POLL They have also claimed the Azov battalion, whose members include ultranationalists and neo-Nazis, are holding civilians in Mariupol “hostage”.
