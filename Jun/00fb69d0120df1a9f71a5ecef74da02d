YOLA – The Adamawa State Governor Ahmadu Umaru Fintiri has requested the people of the State to understand with him as salaries for June 2022 would be delayed. The Governor explained that the delay in the payment of June salaries to civil servants was because of shortfalls. Governor Fintiri, therefore, asked for understanding from citizens as payment of June salary is delayed. The Governor said that in keeping with its tradition of salary payment on the 23rd or 24th day of the month, the State Government will not renege, but explained that because of the upcoming Sallah celebration expected on July 10th, salary will be paid at the end of the Month just in time for Sallah. “This is to ensure the people celebrate conveniently as Sallah is around the corner, I assure all that salaries would be paid by the end of this month,” Fintiri stated. While appreciating civil servants for their patience and understanding, Governor Fintiri said the delay is to enable them to celebrate Sallah without any challenge. Some civil servants have expressed diverse opinions on the development but said they will understand with the Governor if leave and grants are paid at the same time.
