The flag bearer of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, has said he was taking revenge as he kept President Muhammadu Buhari waiting at the Eagles Square in Abuja moments after the conclusion of the presidential primary. Tinubu stated this during his acceptance speech after he was declared the winner of the party’s presidential primary. The former Lagos Governor polled a total of 1,271 votes from the 2,322 delegates at the Special Convention, to beat his major opponents, Rotimi Amaechi and vice president Yemi Osinbajo secured 316 and 235 votes respectively. Tinubu thanked his wife, supporters and some of his friends who backed his ambition in a lengthy speech. He then added to Buhari: “Mr President, I am sorry for keeping you waiting too long since yesterday. “But this is the time to take revenge. You have taken too long sometimes. “I only sympathize with the mother of the nation. Whatever punishment the president takes this afternoon, we asked for it together when we said a vote for APC,” Tinubu said.
