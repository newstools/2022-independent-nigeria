Digital creator and comedian, Godson Chukwuebuka Eze, professionally known as Agent of laughter has narrated why he ventured into comedy and decided to take it as a full time job. The comedy merchant made this known in an exclusive chat with Daily Sun recently, while sharing his journey into comedy skit making in Nigeria, he said “The first  opportunity I had to feature in a big comedy skit was with the Xploit comedy team then followed with Brodashaggi. Then afterwards, the little exposure I had after this experience really made me take the job seriously because I really wanted exposure and the fame lifestyle”, he said. The promising comedian who has over 1.8 million fan base on Facebook and huge following across other social media platforms also noted the challenges he faced while starting his career, he said  “At the point when I started making comedy videos, I was using a low  budget android device to shoot and create these videos, but then I was getting worried about the quality I could get out of it, I was really trying my best to get something standard and neat to be able to create similar contents I see on television and on the Internet, so I had to do a lot of deep research on video quality and aspect ratios while gradually learning how to edit at the same time. I concluded on getting a camera and from then henceforth I kept on upgrading my cameras till I got to the current nice one I have right now. Another challenge was like getting people to shoot with you on set because people are really busy but then I’m thankful that I had friends around me who were willing to sacrifice just to be on set”, said Agent of Laughter. Speaking about his choice of moniker ‘Agent of Laughter’, he said “When I was trying to come up with the name, I did some deep thinking and then I felt like okay how do I tell people that laughter is my priority….So ‘Agent of laughter’ simply means laughter has sent me”, he said. The funny man further revealed that initially when he started comedy, his parents were skeptical about his choice of career but later accorded him full support to chase his dreams. Agent of Laughter sharing his 2022 goals further disclosed that he hopes to attain more fame in 2022, in his words “I need a lot of people to see my craft, there are 7 billion people on this planet”, said Agent of Laughter.
