Oriental Energy Resources has donated 1,000 bags of sanitary pads to girls in two secondary schools in Akwa Ibom State. The benefiting schools, Ibesikpo Secondary Commercial School, Ibesikpo Asutan and Amayam Community Secondary Schools, Ikot Ekpene council areas received 650 and 350 bags respectively. The gesture which was part of the oil company’s corporate social responsibility aimed at providing sensitisation on menstrual hygiene and fighting the high rate of school dropouts due to period poverty among girls in junior secondary two and three in the country. It is also to discourage the use of rags and other harmful materials by girls during their menstrual period due to their inability to afford proper sanitary pads. Speaking at the presentation of the items, managing director of Oriental Energy Resources Ltd, Mr. Mustapha Indimi, said the initiative was in support of the Menstrual Hygiene Day which takes place May 28 every year.
