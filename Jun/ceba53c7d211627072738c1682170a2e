 ABUJA – The newly elected presi­dential candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC), and former gover­nor of Lagos State, Bola Tinubu, has been urged to carry party members along. He was also asked to “im­mediately embark on rec­onciliation with fellow aspi­rants and aggrieved leaders of the APC.” A party chieftain and so­cial commentator, Garus Go­lolo, told Daily Independent in Abuja, that only “by car­rying every member along will the APC outwit the can­didates of the PDP and NNPP respectively.” Gololo, who expressed fear of a mass exodus of ag­grieved party members to other parties, said that, “it is not enough to win the prima­ries. APC at this point must be very careful, otherwise, those who lost the primaries will work against it at the gen­eral elections.” He noted the popularity enjoyed by Kwankwaso and Atiku in the North, noting that, “APC can only enjoy something close to this if they carefully pick a credible run­ning mate for its flag bearer.” He also warned the newly elected flag bearer against considering the Senate Pres­ident, Ahmad Lawan, as his running mate; adding that the results of the primaries shows that the Senate Presi­dent is not acceptable in the North. “If Tinubu by any mistake picks Lawan as a running mate, he will lose the 2023 election because Lawan is not a credible running mate at all,” he insisted.
