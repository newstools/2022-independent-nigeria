FC Barcelona are yet to sanction any notable exit since announcing Philippe Coutinho’s €20 million move to Aston Villa. With player sales playing a crucial role in helping Barcelona generate the transfer revenue this summer, the club must find a way to offload more of their unwanted players. Barça have been issued a positive update surrounding the futures of Samuel Umtiti and Riqui Puig, with both the players reportedly keen on sealing their exit before training begins during the first week of July. According to Ruben Uria, another Barcelona star is in contention to leave the club in the near future. The player in question is Clement Lenglet. The Frenchman has fallen out of favour under Xavi, and his role in the team could dwindle further after the arrival of Andreas Christensen and, potentially, another centre-back. Uria indicates Lenglet has become a subject of interest of Tottenham Hotspur and AS Roma. Both the player are interested in striking a loan deal with Barça over the services of their French centre-back. Roma have proposed a permanent transfer, whereas Spurs want to sign Lenglet on loan, but with an option to purchase him. Barcelona are likely to opt for the latter, given that they are keen on sealing the exit of the defender on a permanent basis. The Catalans, though, would ideally prefer a direct sale in the summer, in order to generate a sizable transfer revenue. -Advertisement- POLL However, given Lenglet’s struggles over the past year and a half, it will be difficult for him to convince Tottenham to make a huge splurge for the French international. The player himself could play a critical role in this saga. With the FIFA World Cup 2022 just around the corner, the former Sevilla centre-back may prefer joining a club where he can get regular game-time next season.
