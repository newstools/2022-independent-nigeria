No fewer than 3000 people in Zamfara State have benefited from the free medical fiesta sponsored by the National Women leader of All Progressives Congress (APC), Dr Betta Edu. The free medical fiesta, which is part of the grassroots empowerment programme of Dr Edu, provided a free test for blood pressure, and sugar levels, and free surgeries among others. In her address, after Governor Bello Matawalle had declared open the free medical fiesta, Dr Betta said, “It is imperative to support the effort of our people’s governor, Governor Bello Matawalle in his quest to lead Zamfara State towards the path of sustainable development. ” It is a known fact that one of the core factors that engender personal and public development is quality of life provided by the healthcare system. “Quality health is a priority. His Excellency Governor Bello Matawalle has done very well, and we will support him to reach out to more citizens of Zamfara State, as well as Internally displaced persons.” While declaring open the free medical care programme, Governor Matawalle emphasised that the development of the state was incomplete without the basic development of the people. He said the people must be empowered along with basic means of life as the government, adding that his administration was unrelenting in building enabling environment for individuals to thrive. Meanwhile, over 1000 women from New Nigeria Peoples Party, NNPP, and other political parties seized the occasion to defect to APC in solidarity with Dr Betta Edu. -Advertisement- POLL The wife of the state Governor, Hajia Aisha Bello Matawalle, who was also present at the free medical fiesta to support the mobilization of women in Zamfara to the programme, urged all beneficiaries of the free healthcare programme to vote for APC in the forthcoming general elections.
