ABUJA – The Action Peoples Party (APP) will on Monday drag the presidential candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu, to court to challenge his academic qualification to stand for the 2023 election. The decision, according to APP, followed alleged irregularities in the academic qualification and documents submitted by Tinubu to the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC). The Chairman of the party, Uche Nnadi, who disclosed this on Friday, added that the party has enough facts to nail Tinubu Recall that INEC had on Friday published the list of candidates to contest the 2023 election. According to the APP Chairman, APC candidate Tinubu is not eligible to contest as his forms contain alleged false information. Tinubu denied attending Primary and Secondary but claims a university degree in the new INEC forms published on Friday. The APP Chairman said that Tinubu commits perjury as he abandons his earlier claim of attending primary school, sworn in an affidavit to run for governor but now claims not to have attended primary school. Tinubu’s new forms, he said contradicted his 2007 affidavit that he has primary school and secondary. “Tinubu’s new declaration in new INEC forms of not attending primary and secondary school is false information, in view of earlier nomination forms of 2007 on oath containing alleged controversial primary and secondary schools he claimed to have,” he said.
