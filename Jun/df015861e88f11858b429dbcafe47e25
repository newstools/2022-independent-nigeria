One of the frontline presidential aspirants on the platform of the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) and Sokoto State Governor, Aminu Tambuwal has revealed why he stepped down for former Vice President Atiku Abubakar at the presidential primary of the party held in Abuja. Daily Independent had last Saturday reported that Governor Tambuwal withdrew from the presidential race and asked his supporters to vote for Atiku, the standard flag bearer of the party. Speaking on why he stepped down his presidential ambition to support a fellow aspirant, Atiku, Tambuwal said it was a sacrifice for Nigerians and Nigeria as a country. -Advertisement- While addressing a crowd of supporters shortly after his arrival from Abuja on Friday, the Governor said the sacrifice he made is aimed at strengthening the party, Nigerian democracy, and giving a soft landing to the polity. He said, “Thank you very much our leaders and distinguished supporters from all over the country for your support and cooperation. I must thank the leaders of our party here at the Sokoto State level and every level. “What we have done is for the good of our party and the country. I appreciate every one of you that prayed for me and our party. “The sacrifice that I have made on your behalf is aimed at strengthening our party, our democracy, and, by the grace of God, soft landing our polity. “This is in consonance with the teachings of our leaders and the [emulation] of the examples they have given to us in the past: that we must continue to make sacrifices for the good of all of us and our country. POLL “I thank the people of Sokoto State and all my supporters across the country for their support. Rest assured, we shall work assiduously for the victory of our party come 2023 general election.”
