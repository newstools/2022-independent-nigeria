Nollywood actress, Tonto Dikeh has slammed Reno Omokri after being compared to a presidential aspirant and National leader of the All Progressive Congress (APC), Asiwaju Bola Tinubu. Omokri, while reacting to the viral video of Tinubu saying Buhari would not have emerged as president in 2015 without him, likened the former Lagos Governor to Tonto Dikeh and another Nollywood actress, Nkechi Blessing. He wrote on Twitter on Friday, “Tinubu is just behaving like Tonto Dikeh and Nkechi Blessing. Like a woman who was promised marriage and jilted and is now exploding and exposing the jilter. Buhari don buy market.” -Advertisement- Reacting, Tonto Dikeh in a post on Instagram dragged Omokri and dared him to come to Nigeria, adding that he is always on the wrong side of history and fighting young women with bigger dreams. Tonto Dikeh wrote, “Renooo Atiku’s Houseboy, Twitter fingering from exile. If your mummy born you well come to Nigeria, always on the wrong side of history… Look at the difference your mate Peter Obi is creating. Rather, you are here fighting young girls with bigger dreams than being a bingo to an oga!!! I will come back to give you a reply when Peter Obi wins, as for now, I’ll let you run your errands.”
