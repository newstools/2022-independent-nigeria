World Cup organisers have sold 1.8 million tickets for the 2022 World Cup in Qatar, FIFA said on Wednesday ahead of the next round of ticket sales. Fans in the host nation have bought the largest number of tickets — with sales boosted by a special discount only available to Qatar residents. “Aside from the host nation, the top ten countries for ticket sales based on country of residence in the latest sales period include emerging and established football hotbeds such as Canada, England, France, Germany, India, Saudi Arabia, Spain, the UAE and the USA,” FIFA added. Football’s world governing body hopes to offer a total of 3 million match tickets during the tournament, with the next round of sales scheduled to start on July 5. Qualification for the World Cup in Qatar, whose hosting of the tournament has proven controversial for the reasons explored in this article, has now concluded. The tournament begins on November 21 and finishes 28 days later in Lusail on December 18.
