LAGOS – Ahead of the forthcoming 2023 general elections in Nigeria, former governor of Anambra State and presidential candidate of the Labour Party, Mr Peter Obi, has urged the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC to speed up registration of Nigerians for their PVC, to enable them vote for candidates of their choice in the forthcoming elections. He made the call to INEC in a tweet on his official twitter handle, @PeterObi, stating that from information reaching him, registration in the South-East is characterised by bureaucracy. He wrote; “Information reaching me indicate that voter registration across Nigeria, more so in the South East, is dogged by inertia & bureaucratic bottlenecks. I respectfully call on @inecnigeria to facilitate speedy registration of Nigerians to enable them exercise their voting rights.” see tweet below;
