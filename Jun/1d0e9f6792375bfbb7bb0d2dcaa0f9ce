 AWKA – Why would the police replace the corpse of a 30-year old man that died in its custody with that of a 70- year old man Fami­ly? This is the puzzle facing the family members of Chinonso Omeh who is crying for justice over the alleged killing of Chi­nonso while under police cus­tody at the defunct notorious Awkuzu SARS, now renamed State CID Annex. Mr. Onyebuchi Omeh, el­der brother to Chinonso, who raised the alarm while ad­dressing journalists in Onit­sha on Wednesday said his younger brother, Chinonso, 30, who operated a car wash centre at old Ogbunike Toll gate, was arrested on Febru­ary 4, 2022 at the instance of one Austin Izunnwanne on trumped up charges of threat to life. He said Chinonso was de­tained at Ogidi Police Station before his transfer to Awkuzu but police at Awkuzu denied them access to see him in the cell and even initially denied ever having him in their cus­tody. He said that after repeated attempts to see him at Awkuzu state CID Annex failed, they wrote a petition to the AIG in charge of Zone 13, Ukpo, Anambra State through a law­yer and the Investigating Po­lice Officer (IPO) at Ogidi was summoned who gave a graph­ic account of how when and whom he handed Chinonso over to at Awkuzu SCID Anex. According to him, when the team from Awkuzu was also summoned to Zone 13 Ukpo, they confessed that Chinon­so was in their custody but is dead now having slumped in their cell and later pronounced dead by a medical doctor. Onyebuchi disclosed that when they requested to see his corpse, they were taken to a private mortuary and shown the corpse of a 70-year old man in place of their brother, Chi­nonso. He accused the police at Awkuzu State CID Annex of killing his brother and us­ing him for ritual purposes since they cannot produce his corpse.
