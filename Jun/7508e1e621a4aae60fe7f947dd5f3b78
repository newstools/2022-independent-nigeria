The Bank of Industry (BoI) has invested N3.5 billion in Ketron investment Limited, a Nigerian company owned by property firm Persianas Investment Limited. The deal followed last year’s acquisition of ShopRite, Africa’s largest food retailer, from Shoprite International Limited, which sold its 100 per cent shareholding in Retail Supermarkets Nigeria Limited (RSNL) to Ketron. Tayo Amusan , Nigerian businessman owns Persianas Investment Limited, and he is the Chairman of Ketron Investment Limited. The terms of the deal, it was learnt, included a franchise agreement which secures the right of RSNL to continue to use the Shoprite brand. The deal also included an administration and services agreement which provide RSNL with administration and technical support from the Shoprite Group for an initial five-year period. Prior to the sale of the retail brand, which launched its operations in Lagos in December 2005, Shoprite had expanded to 25 outlets across 11 Nigerian states and the Federal Capital Territory (FCT).
