Coach Aliyu Zubairu has charged the fans to continually sup­port and motivate players of Gombe United. This happened after the week 31 games where the Savanah Scor­pions defeated Heartland of Ow­erri 3-2 in a very tensed match in Gombe. In that match, Gombe United saw their three goals lead near­ly cancelled by Heartland in that m fixture that got their fans worked up after the visitors made a late push to score two goals in the last 30 minutes. -Advertisement- The restlessness in the stands did not escape Gombe United Coach, Zubairu, who would later express displea­sure at the hostile reaction of the fans during the match. The home fans began boo­ing their players even when they were still leading towards the end of the game and this, Zubairu believes was not the right attitude. “Gombe fans need to change their character, they are no longer motivating these boys, even when they are leading they were still not okay. it’s not motivating at all. “They need the support of the fans and they themselves should be T our side no matter the result of our matches. “A situation where the fans will turn to be part of the op­ponent won’t be good for the psyche of the players and I beg them to always be by our side even if the result is not going as expected,” lamented Zubairu. POLL In the game, Gombe United leading goal scorer Abdulazeez Yusuf tapped home from close range to open the scoring for the host in the last moment of the tough first half. The forward has now level on goals with Riv­ers United duo of Ishaq Rafiu and Chijioke Akuneto on 14 goals at the top of the league’s goal-scoring chat.
