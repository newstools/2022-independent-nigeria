ILORIN – Alh. Waziri Yakub Gobir, on Saturday emerged as the governorship candi­date of the Young Progres­sives Party (YPP) by affir­mation and has vowed to occupy the Kwara State Hovernment House by 2023 as governor, just like its current occupant, Gov­ernor Abdul Rahaman Ab­dulRazak, did in 2018 at the same venue in Ilorin. Gobir made the decla­ration at the Gobir House, GRA, which also serves as the YPP state secretar­iat where it transformed into after being the for­mer All Progressives Con­gress (APC) state chapter branch, and from where the current governor made a similar pledge in 2018. “I consider today a mile­stone knowing how we all started in 2018. We donated this same premises to APC from where the party won the governorship. That shows that we were in­strumental to their being in power today. -Advertisement- “From here, the gover­nor promised to be in gov­ernment house in 2018. I am also pledging to be in government house by God’s grace in 2023,” Gobir said. Gobir, a former finan­cier of the ruling APC both at the state and national level, had since parted ways with the party over differences. He also said that YPP had a formidable structure across all 193 wards in the state with which to win the governorship election next year. “We have over 50, 000 registered members which translates to guaranteed same amount of votes even before full campaign begins.” Commenting on the choice of Gobir as the party’s standard bearer, Chief Dele Ogunbayo, state chairman of YPP, said the party was lucky to have a man like him to run on the party platform. POLL Addressing the dele­gates from across the state, Mohammed Tusariki, YPP Zonal National Chairman, North Central, commend­ed the state branch for the primaries, stating that the delegates made a good choice in Gobir.
