LAGOS – Foremost Yoruba Diaspora organization, Yoruba One Voice (YOV), has said that the only solution to the myriads of problems bedeviling Nigeria is to embrace regionalism as the best option to accommodate the yearnings of other ethnic nationalities or review the country’s existence through renegotiation. Rising from its annual con­ference held virtually on Tues­day, YOV in a communiqué issued after the meeting main­tained that the present situation in the country depends on the will of the people to put their destiny in their hands. The apex Yoruba Diaspo­ra group, while insisting that it will not fall for the bumpy traps of detractors in its deter­mination to seek liberation of the Yoruba race, condoled with the government of Ondo State and the people of the state on the Sunday’s gruesome killing of scores of worshippers of St. Francis Catholic Church, Owo. YOV also blamed the Fed­eral Government for failing to secure the country, saying the attack on the Catholic Church where about 75 people were killed; the killing of Deborah Samuel in Sokoto, and that of a Catholic Church priest in Abu­ja, was nothing but signs of imminent war in Yorubaland. It, however, urged all Yoru­ba sons and daughters, both home and in the Diaspora to get themselves prepared for imminent war. Meanwhile, in his address at the meeting, the Aare On­akakanfo of Yorubaland, Iba Gani Adams, who is also the global Convener of the group, stated that the multifaceted problems affecting Nigeria can only be solved through regionalism. Adams, while explaining the rationale behind YOV’s quest for regionalism as a solution to the problem of the country, reaffirmed the group’s commitment to the emancipa­tion of the Yoruba race, saying the Yoruba Diaspora group will continue to use all possible means to seek the blessing of the international community.
