A Rhode Island zoo has announced the birth of a critically endangered red wolf pup. The zoo popularly known as Roger Williams Park Zoo in Providence announced the birth of the firstborn at the facility in 2005. “The zoo’s zookeepers and veterinary team continue to monitor mom and baby through the use of an infrared camera located inside the wolves’ newly built birthing den. While the pup has been observed nursing and appears to steadily gain weight, the next month is a critical time for the pup’s development,” the zoo announced on social media. -Advertisement- Red wolves are considered to be the world’s most endangered canid species, with 15-20 remaining in the wild.
