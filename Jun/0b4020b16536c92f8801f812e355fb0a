The Director General, Nigerian Geological Survey Agency (NGSA), Dr Abdulrazaq Abubakar has said that the only way to diversify our economy and move away from reliance on oil is for the government to sustain funding for the solid mineral sector. He added that the sector is doing better than it used to because of the high-quality data his agency generates, which attracts an influx of foreign investors looking to invest in the country or obtain information. Garba told this to journalists on Monday in Abuja during a press conference on the achievements of the Nigerian Geological Survey Agency since he took over as Director General, while, praising President Muhammadu Buhari and the Minister of Mines and Steel Development for prioritizing NGSA financing. -Advertisement- He said: “In terms of funding, NGSA has never had it so well, but, like Oliver Twist, we’re begging for more because we need to keep doing what we’re doing. “Prior to the discovery of oil, work was done nonstop for three decades; we never had that in the solid-state. If we are able to sustain the funding we had in the mineral sector in the last 8 years or so, we should be able to diversify the economy. “Nigeria is not yet a fully mining nation, that the country is still at an upstream level whereby data generation is very important as well as the quality of such data”, he said. He further stated that “The influx of investors into Nigeria and of course the influx of investors requiring information is much more than what the country had before and that’s because the quality of data generated is attractive to a lot of investors and the process has to be sustained. “Data generation is not something you do and stop, you have to be continuously generating geoscience data to attract the right type of investment, since we came on board, that’s about 3 years ago, the focus of the current management of NGSA are three roles; geoscience data generation for national development, infrastructural development, when you have the best brain and there are no tools to work, then you cannot achieve anything and thirdly is capacity development, to have the best brain because NGSA is the bridge between the industry and the academics and that’s why our work is partly research and partly the industry”. “If you equally have the best brain and you don’t develop them continuously, then they will become dead wood”. POLL He maintained that since the agency came on board, the level of data being generated has over the years attracted the right type of investment and the investment of the government in generating the data senses has yielded a good result, he said NIMET is one of the success stories among numerous achievements achieved by the agency. “On the NIMET project which has been on for some time, I believe many of you journalists were there when some of the companies meet with the representatives of the Ministry of Mines and Steel Development marking the end of the submission and closure of the project” “the data has been duly received and we as the NGSA and practitioner of the profession have reviewed some of the data, though all along we part of the processes that led to the generation of the data, the interpretation because we have what we called Embed Staff, and the essence of having embed Staff is to train our staff so that we build our capacity and capacity of our staff to be able to do such project in the future” “The result has been received and exploration is about looking for which mean you find in some cases and you may not find in some cases but one good thing is that our finding are quite exciting because on one part, some of the areas the tracks of the mineralization that we found have generated quite significant interest” He maintained that the NIMET project itself is a means to an end and not an end on it own.
