AKURE – Police has been given ultimatum to produce killers of High Chief Tunde Ilori Elerewe who was assassinated in Owo, Ondo State, by some unidentified persons on December 15, 2021. The family of the deceased has threatened to evacuate the remains of the deceased from the FMC morgue and dump them at the palace of Olowo of Owo. Hon. Olasupo Olakunori, a younger brother of the deceased, handed down the threat because Police has failed to apprehend the killers of the traditional High Chief in spite of several evidence supplied to the police. The family alleged the Police failed to prosecute some suspects and their ringleader(names withheld) who were arrested in connection with the incident. According to the aggrieved family, High Chief Elewere was allegedly assassinated by the suspects while returning from a disputed land with the Land Dispute Committee constituted by His Majesty the Olówó of Owo. The Committee had gone to resolve land dispute between him and some persons(names withheld)at Amurin Oganyín, a village in Owo. The family also alleged that the Police had carried out “an autopsy examination on the late Chief Tunde Ilori Elerewe at the Federal Medical Centre, Owo, without the consent and presence of any member of the family. “The question now is, who was responsible for the payment of the autopsy? Is it the Nigerian Police, or the authority of Federal Medical Centre or the principal suspect?” -Advertisement- POLL The deceased’s family alleged that the suspects were released on grounds that there was no concrete evidence linking them to the killing of the traditional High Chief. However, the family of the deceased has appealed to Nigerians for legal assistance in pursuit of justice for the deceased. The family, therefore, urged His Majesty Olowo of Owo, Oba Gbadegesin Ogunoye III, to use his good office to ensure the killers of Chief Elewere are fished out and prosecuted while waiting for the decision of Police highest authority.
