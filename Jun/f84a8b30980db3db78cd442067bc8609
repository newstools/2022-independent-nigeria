KATSINA – Governor Aminu Bello Masari of Katsina State on Wednesday has flagged off the over N4.3 billion flyover intersection project in the metropolis. Speaking shortly before the flag-off of the project at Sarki Abdulrahman/ GRA roundabout in Katsina, Masari said the project is the of a committee established to promote urban renewal in the state capital and other major towns. “By this effort, Katsina state has joined the league of states that have various flyovers and underpasses in the state capital and other big towns within the country”. -Advertisement- He said before May 29, 2023, we will be able to complete the improvement of traffic flow and decongest the volume of vehicular movement within and outside the state capital. “Our plans after improving the inflow and outflows of traffic in the major entrances, the government have decided to have similar arrangements at Kofar Guga to also improve the traffic flow for efficiency”, he added. The Governor maintained that the urban renewal programme was meant to create a new Katsina city, but due to paucity of funds, insecurity and other challenges, the government is not able to move fast as expected. He, however, hoped that the projects would be completed as scheduled to enable the people to reap their benefits. Tasiu Dandagoro, the state Commissioner for Works, Housing and Transport, earlier said the ongoing construction of the underpass bridge has reached eighty per cent completion, while that of Kofar Kwaya has reached forty per cent completion.
