Chelsea owner, Todd Boehly, has assured the club’s manager Thomas Tuchel that he will be able to count as many as six new signings to bolster his squad before the summer transfer window closes, according to the Telegraph. Talks between Tuchel and Boehly, who is standing in as acting sporting director following the departure of Marina Granovskaia, took place this week. A plan is now in place to boost the Chelsea squad, which failed to keep pace with Liverpool and Manchester City last season. Tuchel will have a £200 million budget that could be boosted further by the sale of several players who could be deemed surplus to requirements. Chelsea will look to add their forward line once Romelu Lukaku’s return to Inter Milan on loan is finalised in the coming days. Meanwhile, the likes of Manchester City’s Raheem Sterling, Sevilla’s Jules Kounde, Juventus’ Matthijs de Ligt and the trio of Brazil internationals, Gabriel Jesus, Raphinha and Richarlison, have been linked with a move to Chelsea in the past few days.
