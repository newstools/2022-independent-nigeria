LAGOS – Prince Babatunde Edward, the Lagos State Coordinator of the Bola Tinubu Support Organisation BTSO, has said despite contrary permutations by political ignoramus, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu is going to win the 2023 presidential elections. Prince Edward made the statement on Saturday during a media parley at the association’s Secretariat at Abule Egba, stressing that, according to the slogan of BTSO, ‘Bola Tinubu is in it to win it’, because the odds are against the person of Atiku, the presidential candidate for the PDP, while the odds are in Tinubu’s favours. He said, “Nigerians are aware of how Atiku corruptly enriched himself as the Vice President under the Obasanjo administration, leading to an open confrontation with his principal. The same Nigerians have also seen how Asiwaju Tinubu transformed Lagos from a decaying City to a smart one. He should be allowed to transform Nigeria to a smart country too.” Prince Edward, explained that the organisation is . also organising series of meetings to affirm their commitment to Alhaji Abdulahi Kuso, the National Coordinator of BTSO, with the aim to letting him and the national officers know their preparations and mobilisation excercises for voters to get their PVCs and subsequently vote Asiwaju Tinubu at the presidential election come 2023. “We also use this medium to celebrate his victory at the primaries, but to congratulate him for the deserved victory, wishing him greater wins ahead, especially at the presidential election. “Our organisation was created to replicate the goodwill of Asiwaju Bola Tinubu to indigent members of the society, by executing alleviation programmes in the areas of education, health, feeding social amenities and mobilising voters to vote for him in 2023.
