P/HARCOURT – After a hectic political moment in Nigeria, Rivers State Governor, Nyesom Wike has left the state for a holiday in Turkey. Governor Wike who shared the pictures of his vacation on his official twitter handle posed with his Abia state counterpart, Okezie Ikpeazu, former Commissioner for sports in Rivers State, Boma Iyaye and Marcus Nlee, left the shores of Rivers State on Tuesday morning. Wike twitted “finally in Turkey for a much needed vacation with my brother governor Okezie Ikpaezu”. The governor has been involved in series of closed door meetings with some top politicians across party line shortly after the 2022 presidential primary of the People’s Democratic Party, PDP, including members of the opposition political  parties. Only last week, Wike met with Peter Obi, presidential candidate of the Labor Party, Governor David Umahi of the All Progressives Congress, APC, Senator Rabiu Kwankwaso of the New Nigerian People’s Party, NNPP and the Bauchi state Governor and former presidential aspirant, Senator Bala Mohammed of the PDP in his private residence in Port Harcourt, the state capital. The visits were sequel to a strong rumor of Wike’s alleged plan to dump the opposition party after failing to make the cut in becoming a running mate to the flag bearer of the party for the 2023 election, Atiku Abubakar. Recall that Governor Wike emerged second in the May 28/29 presidential primary which was won by the former Vice President, Atiku Abubakkar who garnered over a thousand votes to beat other contenders. Atiku in turn shocked everyone when he dumped Wike and rooted for the Governor of Delta state, Dr Ifeanyi Okies as his running mate, a choice that has sparked general condemnation by party faithful. -Advertisement- POLL It is not clear when Governor Wike will return from his holidays. But sources said the Governor may shock everyone by taking a decision that may be a huge surprise when he returns to the state.
