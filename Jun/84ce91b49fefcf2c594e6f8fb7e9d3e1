ABUJA – Some aggrieved Senators on the platform of the All Progressives Congress (APC), numbering about 22 on Tuesday met with President Muhammadu Buhari. The lawmakers, who were led by Sen. Orji Uzor Kalu, had vowed to defect from the party over the outcome of primaries in their state ahead of the 2023 general elections. Senator Kalu said the lawmakers felt disenfranchised by the process. Appealing to the Senators during the meeting, President Buhari urged them to exercise restraint in their decision to defect from the party. The President noted that such move will be a threat to the APC’s majority in the National Assembly. After the meeting, Kalu said the aggrieved Senators would no longer pursue defection from the APC. In his social media page, Kalu said, “earlier this afternoon, I led the 22 aggrieved Senators and members of the All Progressive Congress to President Muhammad Buhari,GCFR. “Our meeting with Mr President was successful and the issue of decamping from our party has been laid to rest.”
