UEFA have confirmed the specific dates for the 2022/23 Champions League rounds, with the Qatar World Cup set to have an impact on planning for next season. The tournament is the first in history to take place midway through a European campaign as FIFA made the decision for it to be played across November and December. Domestic and continental competitions are, of course, set to be halted during the winter spectacle. UEFA had to bear this in mind as they finalised the dates for the 2022/23 edition of the Champions League, with just a slight tweak to proceedings. As per European football’s governing body, the first group-stage fixtures will be played on September 6 or 7 – a week earlier than usual – with the second round of matches scheduled for a fortnight after. Group fixtures will run up until November 1 and 2 – almost a month earlier than a regular season. The final matches of the group stage did not take place until early December during last season. As has become customary, the Champions League will then take a mid-season break – this time taking into account the World Cup – before knockout fixtures will be begin. The round of 16 will be played across the week commencing the 14 and 21 February, with the return legs scheduled for the week commencing the 7 and 14 March. Quarter-final ties will be played on 11/12 April and 18/19 April, with the last-four fixtures taking place under a month later across 9/10 May and 16/17 May. The final is scheduled slightly later this time round on 10 June 2023 and will take place at the Ataturk Olympic Stadium in Istanbul. Real Madrid will be hoping to defend the crown that they secured for the 14th time against Liverpoolin Paris in late May. In the meantime, the Premier League has four representatives ahead of the new campaign.
