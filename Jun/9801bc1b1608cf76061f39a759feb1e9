The Association of Senior Staff of Banks, Insurance and other Financial Institutions (ASSBIFI), has said that as long as the government is not enforcing and encouraging insurance practices, its contribution to the nation’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) will continue to be abysmally low. Oyinkan Olasanoye, President of ASSBIFI, who said this recently at a media forum, said when proper policies are not well implemented, it will continue to affect its contribution to the GDP. She called for strict enforcement of the policies and a change of attitude by Nigerians towards the issue of insurance. -Advertisement- “Most Nigerians are ignorantly or arrogantly shying away from insurance, unlike most countries where insurance is taken as part of everyday life. “For instance, there is a policy that there should be insurance coverage for all buildings, construction, motor vehicles and professionals, but i wonder how many Nigerians believe in it,” she said.
