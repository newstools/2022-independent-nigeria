Dr. Ogbonnaya Onu, imme­diate past Minister of Sci­ence and Technology and a presidential aspirant on the platform of the All Progres­sives Congress (APC), on Wednesday, declared in Benin City, Edo State capital, that he would deploy his vast knowl­edge of technology to unlock the prosperity of the country if elected in the 2023 election. Dr. Onu, former governor of Old Abia State, made the declaration while wooing the Edo State delegates of the APC for the party’s convention com­ing up on June 6 and 7, 2022. The former minister, who was represented by his Edo State Coordinator, Saliu Mo­moh, said no nation has ever become truly great whether in ancient or modern times, without the efficient and ef­fective deployment of science, technology and innovation to nation-building, adding that he is convinced that he has the knowledge, experience, credibility and integrity to rule the country and deploy his wealth of technological experiences into building the nation if given the chance. -Advertisement- According to Onu, Nigeri­ans can no longer continue to depend on other nations of the world to solve their problems as they are better equipped to solve them, them­selves.
