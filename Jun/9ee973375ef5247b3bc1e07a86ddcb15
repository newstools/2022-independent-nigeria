The Northern Governors Forum has expressed shock over the attack on worshippers at the St. Francis Catholic Church Owo, Ondo State which left many dead and others injured. Chairman of the Forum and Governor of Plateau State Simon Bako Lalong said the Forum totally condemns the unprovoked attack on the Church and its worshippers, saying this act is a clear attempt by criminals to instigate religious hatred and inflame passions among Nigerians. Lalong in a statement made available to Daily Independent commiserated with the survivors, families of victims, the Catholic Church and the Christian body in Nigeria. -Advertisement- According to Lalong , the Northern Governors want security agencies to do all that is possible to apprehend those behind the sacrilege, their sponsors and collaborators. This he said will not only ensure that justice is served but ensure a clear message is also sent to criminals who are bent on causing chaos in the country. He also said the Northern Governors are in solidarity with their colleague Governor Rotimi Akeredolu and the Government of Ondo State, assuring of their prayers and support at this very sober moment.
