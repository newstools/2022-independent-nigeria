Five –time world champions Nigeria will set out on course for another title on Wednesday (today) when they depart for the Ghanaian city of Cape Coast, where they will participate in the Seven-Nation WAFU B U17 Championship which begins on Saturday. The two finalists from the tournament in Cape Coast will represent the WAFU B zone at the Africa U17 Cup of Nations billed for Algeria early next year, from where all four semifi­nalists will qualify for the FIFA U17 World Cup finals in Peru. Nigeria, with five world ti­tles in the kitty, and three-time world champions and hosts Ghana will set the tournament rolling on Saturday with a po­tentially-explosive encounter at the Stade Cape Coast starting from 4pm Ghana time (5pm Nigeria time). Coach Nduka Ugbade, who has kept his eyes on the ball and his hands on the plough for several weeks screening and training the lads at the FIFA Goal Project, Abuja, said his objective is to earn a ticket to the AFCON finals in Algeria. “I am happy with the squad that we have been able to come up with, and I can say confident­ly that we are going to Ghana to do the nation proud. “Our primary objective is to earn a ticket to the Africa Cup of Nations, and then we go full throttle for the trophy. Nigeria have a pedigree in U17 football and we cannot afford to disap­point,” he said. The Golden Eaglets are in Group A of the competition, with a second match against Togo’s U17 boys on Tuesday next week, also at the Stade Cape Coast.
