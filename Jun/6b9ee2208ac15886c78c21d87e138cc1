Mubarak Ayanniyi, the Chief Executive officer of Betalife, a health care company that provides fast health response, promotes healthy lifestyles and helps people to meet their health needs, in this interview with IKECHI NZEAKO, disclosed how the company is connecting blood donors, patients and hospitals in bid to promote quality of life and save lives. Excerpts: Tell us about your company? We provide health services that range from blood donation, ambulance services and telemedicine and keeping heath records. -Advertisement- One of our products is in the area of blood donation. On 14 June every year, the world celebrates Blood Donation Day; every two seconds, someone out there needs blood and this is not readily available. People do not know the importance of blood donation in Africa; for instance, Nigeria needs 1.5 million pints of blood every year but only 500,000 pints are donated annually. So, there is need to sensitize people on the need to donate blood and make them regular donors. What we do basically is connect blood donors to patients across various hospitals; if a patients needs blood in a particular hospital, you can place your request on our app and we will send notifications to donors around that particular hospital. When the donor gets the request, he will go to that hospital and donate. How do blood banks come into the picture? POLL We also connect blood banks to hospitals; the current method of blood collection is manual and time consuming. With our system, the hospital can send notification to the blood bank and it will get blood in no time. We bridge the gap among the hospital, blood bank and the patient. We want to connect everyone in the system. We want to provide a better life for everyone with BetaLife. With BetaLife, everyone can have access to a better life. What other services are providing? We are also providing a faster emergency response service that anybody anywhere can access healthcare service in the country.
