The Senate will on Wednesday screen seven ministerial nominees recently forwarded to it for approval by President Muhammadu Buhari. Announcing the move during plenary on Tuesday, the Senate President, Ahmad Lawan, urged lawmakers to prepare for the exercise as successful nominees would be confirmed and immediately sent to the executive. Recall that President Buhari, in a letter dated 15th June, 2022, requested the Senate to confirm the nomination of seven ministerial nominees. The nominees for confirmation include: Henry Ikechukwu Ikoh – Abia State; Umana Okon Umana – Akwa Ibom State; Ekumankama Joseph Nkama- Ebonyi State; and Goodluck Nanah Opiah – Imo State. Others are Umar Ibrahim El-Yakub – Kano State; Ademola Adewole Adegoroye – Ondo State; and Odum Udi – Rivers State.
