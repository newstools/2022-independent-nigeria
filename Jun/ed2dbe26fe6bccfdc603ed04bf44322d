Barcelona have rejected claims they are planning for Frenkie de Jong’s departure to Manchester United this summer. The Manchester Evening News revealed last month that United are weighing up a potential £75million move for De Jong and that Erik ten Hag had identified the player as a priority target. De Jong enjoyed a successful period under Ten Hag at Ajax between 2017 and 2019. The pair have a strong relationship and it’s understood Ten Hag would like to bring the midfielder to Old Trafford. Barcelona’s financial problems are well documented and it appears the Catalan giants would be open to a sale, to raise some much-needed capital. -Advertisement- However, Barcelona’s vice-president Eduard Romeu denied reports that the club are planning to sell De Jong on Friday. “We have not budgeted for the sale of players,” Romeu said. “Frenkie de Jong? If he leaves, it’s a technical decision, not an economic one. But I repeat, we have planned no departure.” Barcelona unveiled Spotify as the club’s new sponsor this week and De Jong was used in promotional images. The player has also indicated that it’s his preference to stay at the Nou Camp and that Barcelona are his ‘dream’ club.
