LAGOS – The Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) has reiterated that Thurs­day’s 2023 Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) qualify­ing match between the Super Eagles and the Leone Stars of Sierra Leone at the M.K.O Abi­ola National Stadium, Abuja will be played without fans in the stands. No thanks to the one-match ban placed on the country by world football-governing body, FIFA over the fracas that followed the end of 2022 FIFA World Cup playoff round against the Black Stars of Gha­na in March. NFF General Secretary, Dr. Mohammed Sanusi smade this clear in Abuja on Tuesday ahead of the crucial qualifier. “We want to appeal to our very passionate football fans to take heart for this one game. It is only a one-match ban, after which they can again start trooping out to support the Super Eagles. “The match against Sierra Leone will be without fans as a consequence of what hap­pened after the match against the Ghanaians. “Nonetheless, we want to urge all our football fans, and indeed all Nigerians, to sup­port the team whichever way they can and pray for success against the Sierra Leoneans on Thursday,” said Sanusi. Thursday match is a Day 1 game of the 2023 AFCON starting from 5pm. Four days later, they tackle ‘The Falcons and True Parrots’of São Tomé and Príncipe at the 45,000-ca­pacity Grand Stade de Agadir in southern Morocco. While CAF has appointed Ivorian officials to take charge of the encounter in Abuja, Li­berian officials led by referee Hassen Corneh will oversee the match in Agadir on Mon­day.
