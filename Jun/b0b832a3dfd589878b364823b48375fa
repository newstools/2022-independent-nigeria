Following the declaration of the presidential candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Asiwaju Bola Tinubu that he is still in the race of finding his vice presidential candidate terunning, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Femi Gbajabiamila on Monday promised to help him find a good running mate ahead of the 2023 presidential election. It could be recalled that Tinubu had earlier submitted Ibrahim Kabir Masari as a running mate to meet the Independent National Electoral Commission’s (INEC) deadline. But while speaking at an event held to mark the 60th birthday celebration of Gbajambiamila in Abuja on Sunday, Tinubu disclosed that he is still searching for his running mate ahead of the 2023 presidential election. The statement read in part, “Thank you for both of you; you have not rocked the boat and we need to learn from both of you how you made the pair work because I’m still searching for my running mate”. Reacting to his declaration, Gbajabiamila promised to help the former Governor of Lagos State in search of his running mate. He said, “You said in your address that many years ago you consulted with a younger brother on the issue of WAEC and that consultation bore fruits. “I give you my parting shot. It is that time again to consult with your younger brother. I will give you a running mate that you will enjoy working with.”
