Pastor Tunde Bakare, the General Overseer of Citadel Global Community Church, has spoken for the first time, since he recorded no single vote during the just-concluded presidential primary of the ruling All Progressives Congress, APC. Bakare was one of the aspirants who paid N100million to purchase the presidential form and has praised himself for his conduct during the election. According to the cleric, he is glad he was able to defeat the character test of bribery and corruption at the just concluded APC presidential primary. ”I am happy that I have passed the test of character by not paying any delegate. I passed the test of courage, by speaking the truth in the midst of wolves and the test of conviction by standing true to my beliefs. “Those who will make a difference must be different,“ Bakare was quoted by The Nation.
