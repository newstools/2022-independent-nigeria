The traditional ruler of Oakland, the Asin of Oakland, Oba (Sir) Pius Omiyejola Akande, on Monday, on behalf of the Chiefs-in-Council and the good people of Oka, condemned in strong terms the killing of worshippers on Sunday at St. Francis Catholic Church, Owo, Ondo State. He described the attack by the terrorists as atrocious, barbaric, monstrous and wolfish. In a statement personally signed by the monarch and made available to newsmen in Akure, the state capital, by his Chief Media Adviser, Tolorunlogo Jerome, he decried the manner in which the “senseless assailants massacred men and women, including poor children, whose only sin is being a Nigerian.” -Advertisement- Oba Akande commiserated with the Olowo of Owo Kingdom, Oba Ajibade Gbadegesin Ogunoye; the entire people of the Owo Kingdom and the bereaved families of the deceased. He stressed that the umbilical cord between Owo and Oka is amply entrenched in the history of both towns. The traditional ruler also “condoled with the Catholic Church all over the country, specifically His Lordship Most Rev. Dr. Jude Ayodeji Arogundade, the Bishop of Ondo Diocese who is from Oka and the entire Diocese for the unimaginable and irreparable loss.” Commiserating with Governor Oluwarotimi Akeredolu on the alien incident, Oba Akande first commended the Governor for his principled and irrepressible stand on the security of lives and properties of Ondo State people and the entire Yoruba land. He urged the Governor not to relent on his oars in securing the South-West, noting that “the attack is to weaken his resolve.” POLL Oba Akande, therefore, urged the governor to order all security agencies in the state to launch a full-scale investigation into the horrendous act.
