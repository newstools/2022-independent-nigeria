On Saturday, at the M.K.O Abiola National Stadium, Abu­ja, the Flamingos drew goalless with their Ethiopian counter­parts to pick the ticket to India on a 1-0 aggregate. Sanusi said: “The qualifi­cation of the Flamingos to the FIFA U-17 Women’s World Cup, which follows the qualification of the U-20 girls, the Falconets for their own FIFA World Cup taking place in Costa Rica, un­derscores our attention and in­vestment in the women’s game. -Advertisement- “The good outings of the girls are also positive messages to the girl-child in Nigeria that they can always succeed in what they do once they work hard, fo­cus hard and approach things with diligence. “I want to use this opportuni­ty to assure Nigerians that the NFF will ensure the two teams are adequately prepared for the global challenges in India and Costa Rica respectively. “I have no doubt that the Super Falcons, who are cam­paigningintheWomenAFCON next month where they are also seeking FIFA World Cup ticket, will earn their own World Cup qualification as well as retain the AFCON title,” said Sanusi.
