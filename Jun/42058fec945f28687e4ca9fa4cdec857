Romelu Lukaku is trying to “force” a move away from Chelsea this summer, according to reports. It comes after a season of struggle for the Belgian striker on his return to Stamford Bridge. Lukaku made the switch back to the Blues last year from Inter Milan for over £100million, however he only managed to find the net eight times in the Premier League. Manager Thomas Tuchel oftentimes found it tough to get the best out of the 29-year-old, with the side so often missing crucial chances in the final third to tie up matches. The German coach has backed the striker to find his goal-scoring boots though: “Romelu has scored goals all his life. It’s in his body and I tell him all the time to trust his body, trust his brain and to trust his instincts because he knows how to do it [finishing]. He will never lose the ability to score goals, he just needs to rediscover that spark and hopefully, after these two goals he can continue in this way.” -Advertisement- However, Lukaku’s turbulent season has been met with plenty of questions over his future. Following a Sky Italia interview earlier in the season, the forward hinted at a return to Inter Milan someday, with further rumours linking him there once again. That has only been exemplified, as the Telegraph reports that the striker is pushing for a move away from Stamford Bridge this year, willing to take a pay cut to do so. It claims that the Blues would likely begin the transaction as a loan deal, worth roughly £20million, with an option to buy covering the rest of the transfer fee they paid to bring him in. While it may represent a blow to the Blues that the move may not have worked out, especially with their need for a goal scorer, it may come as some security if they are able to recoup most of the transfer fee. It could allow Tuchel to make some much-needed improvements to his front line in the upcoming window.
