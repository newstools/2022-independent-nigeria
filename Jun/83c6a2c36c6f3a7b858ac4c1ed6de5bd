ABUJA – The Centre for Reforms and Public Advocacy (CRPA) has warned the In­dependent National Elec­toral Commission (INEC) against plans by political parties to replace running mates to presidential can­didates. CRPA on Saturday re­minded the electoral body that it was unconstitu­tional and against the new Electoral Act to recognise such term as “place hold­ers” making the rounds in the country’s electoral space. It urged political parties to familiarise themselves with the relevant aspects of the new electoral law and avoid actions capable of causing infractions. The centre said that the extant laws only recognise “associate candidate” and “running mate,” insisting that “Sections 28 and 84 of the amended Electoral Act 2022, relate to only the can­didate – presidential and gubernatorial – and not their running mates.” It noted that by the pro­visions of relevant laws, substitution of candi­dates by political parties becomes possible in cases of withdrawal or death of candidates and these are president, gubernatorial, Senate, House of Repre­sentatives and State As­semblies who were nomi­nated by political parties through valid primaries in accordance with Section 29 and 84. CRPA also explained that Section 33 of the Elec­toral Act says: “A political party shall not be allowed to change or substitute its candidate whose name has been submitted under Sec­tion 29 of this Act, except in the case of death or with­drawal by the candidate: “Provided that in the case of such withdrawal or death of a candidate, the political party affect­ed shall, within 14 days of the occurrence of the event, hold a fresh prima­ry election to produce and submit a fresh candidate to the commission for the election concerned”; and to conform with Section 33, Section 29 must be adhered to, to ascertain categories of candidates captured.” It noted that Section 29 in Sub-section (1) says “Ev­ery political party shall, not later than 180 days be­fore the date appointed for a general election under this Act, submit to the com­mission, in the prescribed Forms, the list of the can­didates the party proposes to sponsor at the elections, who must have emerged from valid primaries con­ducted by the political par­ty.”
