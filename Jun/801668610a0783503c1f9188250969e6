ABAKALIKI – A governorship aspirant on the platform of the All Pro­gressives Congress (APC) in Ebonyi State, Senator Julius Ucha, has called on all political parties fielding candidates for 2023 general election to release 50 percent of the fund each of them realized from sale of forms to the Federal Govern­ment to assist in resolving the ongoing industrial strike by the Academic Staff Union of Universities. Ucha, who made the call in Abakaliki in a chat with Journalists, said that political parties had collected so much money from aspirants and it was necessary that part of it be used in resolving the ASUU strike, which he said, was a major problem currently fac­ing Nigeria. He warned that the endless strike by ASUU was capable of worsening the current insecu­rity in the country. -Advertisement- “It’s very unfortunate that ASUU is still on strike. Govern­ment is the largest shareholder in education in the country. The incessant ASUU strike creates a social problem. “I’m using this opportunity to appeal to political parties that fielded candidates to release 50 percent of the money they col­lected from Aspirants to the Federal government to use it and cushion the effects of the ASUU crisis. Political parties have collected so much money from society. “Political parties are also members of the society. ASUU is also a member of the soci­ety. Children are members of society. So, the entire society is bleeding. Let all political parties help the government”, Ucha advocated. He further said, “When children are in school, it is a very big relief to parents and the entire society. But when they are not in school; their hands are no longer busy; their minds are no longer busy; their brains are now looking for what to do because an idle mind is a devil’s work­shop”. “I’m using this opportunity to call on ASUU and the Fed­eral Government to intensify efforts to resolve this strike. Government can intervene,” Ucha concluded.
