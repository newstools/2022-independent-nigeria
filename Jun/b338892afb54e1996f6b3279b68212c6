Africa is an exciting space where we see innovative, successful models emerging which are critical steps toward addressing the digital literacy challenge. According to Akinola Abdulakeem, CEO and Co-Founder of fast-rising startup, aptLearn.io, we live in an information era, where internet access is the foundational tool used to access key information and digital media necessary to navigate our daily lives.”“The opportunities that come with digital literacy can change the narratives for the youth in previously disadvantaged communities. Furthermore, the social media influencer said, “Through digital literacy, students can access academic materials, workers can access material to help improve their skills required to excel in the jobs they hold, and young entrepreneurs can identify and create products and services needed for a better society”. “In a broader spectrum, he maintained that, digital literacy helps all groups of people effectively source, share and store information. It also exposes people to innovation that is otherwise not possible.” However, those yet to be connected remain blocked off from the benefits of this new era and are falling more behind. Women, the elderly, those with disabilities, people from ethnic or linguistic minorities, indigenous peoples, and residents of poor or isolated locations are among those who have been left behind. The pace of connectivity is slowing, if not reversing, among some constituencies.” Àgbà Akin, as popularly referred to on Twitter, has urged stakeholders from the public and private sectors to work together to promote inclusive and equitable digital engagement for all, in order to participate profitably in the digital economy. “I am confident that, in the not-too-distant future, better coordinated efforts by all government agencies and industry actors in creating sufficient digital competence would turn Nigeria into a big exporter of qualified personnel in this field.”
