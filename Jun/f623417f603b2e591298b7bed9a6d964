The presidential candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu, has taken a swipe at the Senate President, Ahmad Lawan, telling him that he (Lawan) can now lick his wounds. Tinubu said this on Wednesday while delivering his acceptance speech at Eagle Square, Abuja after he was declared the winner of the APC presidential primary. The former governor of Lagos State said he was upset that Lawan competed with him for the party’s ticket, mocking the Senate President for losing the race. “To the legislature, Senate President Ahmad Lawan, I would have been a little upset because you compete with me. But it is over now because you can easily lick your wounds,” Tinubu said. He however thanked Lawan for his efforts as a parliamentarian in moving Nigeria forward. Tinubu polled 1,271 votes to defeat 13 other aspirants, including a former Transport Minister, Rotimi Ameachi and Vice President Yemi Osinbajo, who scored 316 and 235 votes respectively.
