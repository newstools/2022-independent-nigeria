Following the successful completion of its special convention and the emergence of its presidential candidate for the 2023 election, a group of concerned APC members in the Niger Delta region has again requested President Buhari and the APC leadership to hearken to authentic stakeholders in the Niger Delta states who have stridently expressed their dismay and frustration over the inexplicable delay to inaugurate the NDDC substantive Board. In a follow-up letter to President Buhari and the APC National leadership, the APC group, “Committed members of the APC from the Niger Delta Region,” whose letter was signed by the trio of Ebibomo Akpoebide, Menegbo Nwinuamene, and Itam Edem, stated that they are further encouraged to write again to the President and the leadership of APC because they are “reasonably informed that the APC presidential aspirants promised to take up the matter with you, President Buhari to ensure that the Board (NDDC) is inaugurated expeditiously. The APC group further stated that “given the various encounters our presidential aspirants had with party delegates from Akwa Ibom, Abia, Bayelsa, Cross River, Delta, Edo, Imo, Ondo, to Rivers states, our party should no longer be in doubt about the mood of the people of the region with regard to their genuine angst towards the Federal Government for the way we have been badly treated by certain elements in the Federal Government who feed fat on the resources of our region.” The APC group which also thanked President Buhari for “keeping to your words and ensuring that all presidential aspirants were given a fair chance to present themselves to the party’s delegates and be voted for,” also commended the leadership of APC for “ensuring a hitch-free and transparent exercise.” It however noted that it is against the unending calls by Niger Deltans for a halt to the “ongoing illegality in NDDC that we follow up on our letter last week to you, President Buhari and the leadership of our great party entitled “LETTER TO PRESIDENT BUHARI AND THE APC LEADERSHIP ON THE ONGOING ILLEGALITY IN THE NDDC AND THE IMPLICATIONS FOR THE APC IN THE 2023 ELECTIONS.” Akpoebide, Nwinuamene, and Edem reminded President Buhari of the alarm they raised in their earlier letter on the looming consequences of APC’s ill-treatment of the region, especially the ongoing illegality of administering NDDC with a Sole Administrator contraption in violation of the enabling law, the NDDC Act. According to the APC group, “we specifically cautioned that as it stands, the APC cannot win an election in the region except the missteps in NDDC are remedied and the NDDC substantive Board is inaugurated in accordance with the law setting up the Commission. The group further quoted Godspower Tamunosusi as speaking the minds of Niger Deltans in an article, “NDDC: Buhari’s Legacy of Illegality and Contempt,” published in many national newspapers, when he stated that “Niger Deltans are very upset with the disdainful manner the region has been treated.” POLL He also noted that there is increasing anger against the APC in the Niger Delta region “as a result of the very poor, biased, illegal and provocative actions of the Federal Government in the handling of matters concerning the NDDC and the Niger Delta region.” The group also reminded President Buhari and APC leadership that a notable group in the region, The Niger Delta Rescue Movement (NDRM) has already vowed not to back the All Progressives Congress (APC) in the 2023 elections following the delay to inaugurate a substantive board of the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC). The spokesman of NRDM, Jonathan Okwa, speaking in Yenagoa, Bayelsa state, stated that following the prolonged delay of President Buhari to give the Niger Delta people what is rightfully theirs, in accordance with the law, the NDDC Act, the group would ensure the mobilisation of the people of Niger Delta region to vote against the APC in the 2023 presidential and general elections if the board is not inaugurated because the actions of Chief Godswill Akpabio, former Minister of Niger Delta Affairs, have indeed imperilled our party in the Niger Delta States. Akpoebide, Nwinuamene, and Edem aligned with other Niger Deltans to remind President Buhari that Niger Delta leaders, governors, youths, women, traditional rulers, civil society organisations, and other stakeholders, have consistently demanded that he should comply with the law setting up NDDC, end the ongoing illegality in the Commission, and inaugurate the substantive board. The group, therefore, urged President Buhari to “now reboot and reclaim your affinity and APC’s connection with the Niger Delta people after three years of the former Minister’s disastrous manipulation of the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC), which has angered all stakeholders in the region, and thereby make amends for the damage done to the APC in the region.”
