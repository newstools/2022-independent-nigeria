 Alhaji Waziri Yakub Gobir, former financier, All Pro­gressives Congress, (APC), has declared that politics in the state and country has been reduced to a game for the highest bidder while also lamenting that the will­ful stymie of the third-tier of government by the cur­rent administration of Governor Abdulrahaman Abdulrazak of Kwara State has further compounded the woes of common people in the state. Gobir made the declara­tion on Wednesday during his formal defection from APC to the Young Progressives Par­ty (YPP) while also seeking nomination as the party’s standard-bearer for the state’s governorship election in 2023. -Advertisement- “For too long, our beloved state, – like most of Nigeria – has wallowed in abject pen­ury and insecurity, while a very few corner the common wealth and hold the rest hos­tage. “From 100-million-naira nomination forms to del­egates who pay allegiance to the fattest wads of hun­dred-dollar bundles, poli­tics has become a criminal enterprise, where only the most corrupt thrive,” he said on Wednesday in Ilorin at the YPP party headquarters in Ilorin. According to him, the ob­scene monetisation of the electoral process is all part of a grand design to scheme out the most upright, and most competent from participat­ing in the governance of the country.
