LAGOS – The Lagos State Government has disclosed that the unabated corruption of the original plan for Magodo Residential Sheme II could be traced to the activities of residents of the scheme and not just outsiders. The Commissioner for Physical Planning and Urban Development, Dr. Idris Salako made this known during a courtesy call on the ministry by Magodo Residents Association. He decried the motives of residents who are fond of indiscriminately changing the approved uses of their property as well as engaging in other planning infractions in the Government scheme, including unapproved change of height and density, and building in variance with the approved planning permit. Salako urged members of the estate to rise in unison against perpetrators of such untoward acts, who sacrifice the common good of the area for their parochial pecuniary interests and carry on in a way that is inimical to the wellbeing of residents and sustainability of the scheme. The Commissioner explained that measures put in place by the Government to control development in the estate and elsewhere in the State included the imposition of penal fees to discourage illegal and non-conforming developments, regular monitoring and enforcement as well as outright removal of the contravention where possible. “To arrive at a solution to the problems confronting the estate, it is important that the Magodo Residents Association looks inwards by encouraging its members to resolve to abate the growth of commercial uses in the estate. The Estate remains essentially residential despite recent reviews of the scheme”, he said. On the Onikosi land tussle, Salako assured that the solution was just an inch away as the committee set up to resolve the matter was making progress which might result in the creation of a new scheme to accommodate the Onikosi village excision and prevent the emergence of a slum around Magodo Scheme II.
