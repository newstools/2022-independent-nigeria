LAGOS – After a long run of delivering several hits in the music scene, CandyBleakz returns with a project aptly called the “FIRE EP”. Her statement is very clear – she is ready to finally let the world hear her out with the release of this project further projecting her. The 6-track project is a blend of distinct, vibrant sounds that show Candy’s versatility and her newly found street house sound. It is a clear display of her sonic growth since her first tape ‘Öwo Osu’. The FIRE EP is a unique blend of several genres and styles of music put together that compliments Candy’s sound and high tempo. A clever reconstitution of South African house and Nigerian Afropop.
