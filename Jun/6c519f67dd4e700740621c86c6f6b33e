Turkish security officials have captured a Greek national accused of espionage on behalf of the Greek National Intelligence Organization (EYP), state-run TRT Word reported on Saturday. Muhammed Amar Ampara, who was gathering information about the Turkish military and transferring it to the Greek intelligence, was nabbed following an operation by the Turkish National Intelligence Organization (MİT), it said. Ampara posed as a businessman during his travels to Turkey, according to TRT, where he was engaged in activities under the guise of trade. The suspect gathered information about the Turkish Armed Forces (TAF) on the border while also conducting research on Syrians living in Turkey, it said. Ampara is also accused of conducting research on business people linked to the Gülen movement, who have settled in Greece on behalf of the EYP, it said. The Turkish government accuses U.S-based cleric Fethullah Gülen and his followers, known as the Gülen movement, of orchestrating the July 2016 coup attempt. Ankara has designated a terrorist organisation, and embarked on a worldwide crackdown on the movement in the aftermath of the failed attempt. A former ally of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, Gülen denies involvement in the failed putsch. Fellow NATO members Greece and Turkey have long been embroiled in spats over territory, airspace and mineral exploration rights in the Mediterranean and Aegean seas. They are also at odds over migrants and the ethnically divided island of Cyprus.
