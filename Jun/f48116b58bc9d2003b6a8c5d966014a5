ABUJA – While the Eagle square venue for the All Progressive Congress national convention is agog, President Muhammadu Buhari is currently meeting with some APC governors, from the north at the Presidential Villa, Abuja. The meeting is believed to have been convened to wrap up discussion on the issue of consensus candidate prior to the general election in 2023. Although President Buhari has maintained his position on the consensus arrangement, there has not been any agreement among the 23 presidential aspirants. -Advertisement- The meeting with the APC governors from the north is the fourth parley in his effort to ensure that the party presents a consensus candidate so as to reduce acrimony that may arise at the end of the convention. The governors in attendance are Chairman of Progressive Governors Forum and governor of Kebbi state, Atiku Bagudu, chairman of Northern governors Forum and governor of Plateau State, Simeon Lalong, Abubakar Baduru (Jigawa) and Babagana Zulum (Borno). Others are Aminu Bello Masari (Katsina), Abdullahi Sule (Nasarawa), Bello Matawale (Zamfara), Mallam Nasir el-Rufai (Kaduna), Abdullahi Ganduje (Kano), Yahaya Inuwa (Gombe), Abubakar Bello (Niger), and the Yobe State governor, Mai Mala Buni. Beyond this, there has been subtle pressures on the President to endorse his Vice, Yemi Osinbajo to succeed him in 2023. While the convention has officially kicked off with delegates undergoing the registration exercise at the Eagle Square, Osinbajo and former Lagos State Governor, Bola Ahmed Tinubu are currently in Ondo state to commiserate with victims of the church attack on Sunday in Owo.
