The Managing Director/CEO of Mutual Benefit Assurance Limited, Mr. Femi Asenuga, has said that retail space was key to deepening insurance penetration and addressing the sector’s dismal contribution to the gross domestic product (GDP). In addition, Asenuga said because retail insurance was affordable millions of Nigerians could be reached via retail insurance window, adding that even low income earners could access insurance without stress. Mr. Asenuga who stated this during a capacity building interactive session with journalists in Lagos recently noted that retail insurance was a key strategy that his company had adopted to drive penetration into the market. The Mutual Benefits boss said his company had the largest retail marketing team in Nigeria, with specialised products addressing the needs of various segments in the market. He further said, “Our target is on the unserved and underserved in the market and we have been able to provide products that meet and satisfy their needs over the years.” He called on stakeholders of the insurance industry to intensify effort in deepening insurance penetration leveraging retail insurance. He added that Mutual Benefit had from its inception targeted the unserved and underserved populations of the Nigerian market. He said, “We were the first to come out with products selling at a unit price of N50, although it is rebranded now, we are the largest retail market team today.” Speaking on insurance penetration, he lamented that, “It is abnormal to have such a huge population and a shallow penetration of the insurance business.
