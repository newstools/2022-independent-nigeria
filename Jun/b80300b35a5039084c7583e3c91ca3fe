The Federal Capital Territory Muslim Pilgrims Welfare Board (FCT-MPWB) has said that it is set to commence camping for 2022 intending pilgrims to the permanent Hajj Transit Camp, located at Bassan Jiwa, near the Nnamdi Azikwe International Airport Abuja. A statement from the Director of the Board, Mallam Muhammad Nasiru Danmallam said the camping is to prepare the intending pilgrims for their airlift to Saudi Arabia. Danmallam noted that the first flight of FCT intending pilgrims is scheduled to be airlifted on Friday and requested those on the first flight to report on Thursday from 10:00 o’clock in the morning for the collection of their Travel documents and other preparations for their airlift. He explained that intending pilgrims would be subjected to a mandatory PCR test, in line with the guidelines for this year’s Hajj by Saudi Arabian authority and therefore, advised them to report for the exercise and abide by the laid down regulations. He further stated that the intending pilgrims should check for their flight schedules at the head office of the Board in the Central Area, or at the permanent Hajj camp to know their schedules. He hinted the Board has taken measures to ensure compliance with all guidelines for the exercise and it has started receiving visas for FCT 2022 intending pilgrims, while arrangements for the Basic Travel Allowance (BTA) have been concluded. About 2000 intending pilgrims from the FCT are expected to be airlifted from Nnamdi Azikwe International Airport for the exercise this year.
