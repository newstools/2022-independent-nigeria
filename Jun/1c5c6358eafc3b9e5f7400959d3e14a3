AWKA – Chief Okey Muo Aroh a prominent chieftain of  the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Anambra state and a member of the National Executive Committee of the PDP has commiserated with the leadership and lay apostolate of the Catholic church on the dastardly massacre of catholic faithfuls attending the Feast of Pentecost at Owo Ondo State Nigeria. Muo-Aroh  who spoke from his country home Abatete in Idemili-North local government area of Anambra state, condemned the wanton waste of human lives in the unfortunate incident and berated the government of the federation for such level of profanation and sacrilegious act unleashed on worshippers in the House of God. He therefore called on the All Progressives Congress APC  led Federal Government to tackle the deteriorating security situation in the country before the nation is sunk, adding that life has become brutish and short under the present administration in the country. -Advertisement- He however prayed for the repose of the souls of all those that died in the massacre and wished those who were  injured a very speedy recovery from the terror and mayhem. According to him, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) was on a rescue mission in Nigeria and should it clinch power in the next political dispensation, it would address such level of man’s inhumanity to man as evident in the brazen massacre of innocent lives in Owo Ondo State. He said PDP will restore the rule of law and dignity of the human person as well as create a nation where the likes of the Owo tragedy will be history and also recreate the unity in diversity mantra Nigeria was known for before the advent of the incumbent APC led federal government.
