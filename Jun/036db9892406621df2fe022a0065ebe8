SEYI TAIWO-OGUNTUASE AND TOYIN ADEBAYO ABUJA / LAGOS – Professor Mojisola Adeyeye, Director General, National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control (NAFDAC), has said that Ni­gerians do not need medicines if they eat right, stressing that eating right means making healthy food choices from safe, wholesome, and nutri­tious foods. She urged Nigerians to al­ways ensure that only safe, and wholesome food is consumed to boost immunity and im­prove the body’s natural de­fences in fighting diseases. She gave the admonition in Abuja on Tuesday at the NAFDAC celebration of the 4th World Food Safety Day 2022 with the theme ‘Safer Food, Better Health’, where she opined that where food is unsafe, people’s nutritional goals cannot be achieved. In a statement signed by Sayo Akintola, Resident Me­dia Consultant to NAFDAC, Adeyeye was quoted as saying that safe food is an essential component of sustainable de­velopment and contributes to­wards improvement of public health, poverty reduction, and increased food security. She noted that the theme for this year was very apt, as the world gradually returns to normal with the COVID-19 pandemic having lost its firm grip on the world. Adeyeye pointed out that the theme also aligns with the World Health Assembly 75 theme, which is Health for Peace and Peace for Health, adding that safer food indeed takes the front and centre posi­tion for better health and rela­tive personal and world peace. “You all know my popular saying about not needing med­icine if one eats right. Eating right means making healthy food choices from safe, whole­some, and nutritious foods,” she said. POLL She stressed that the oc­casion of World Food Safety Day is an added opportunity for us to create and generate awareness around food safety and situate it as a very signif­icant issue of public health concern, especially in the light of safe, wholesome food being important for boosting immunity and improving the body’s natural defenses in fighting diseases.
