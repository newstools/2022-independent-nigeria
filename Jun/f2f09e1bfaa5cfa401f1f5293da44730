IBADAN  The social media-generated euphoria surrounding the ambition of Mr. Peter Obi, the presidential candidate of Labour Party, has been described as a flash in the pan that would disappear in no time. Founder of Oyo State-based youth group, Ojo Ola Oyo, Mr. Kehinde Olaosebikan, made the declaration in Ibadan Thursday while speaking with journalists at the sideline of the extraordinary meeting of the group at Mount Pleasant Hotel, Podo. Olaosebikan said such flashes were not new to the political, social and economic environments of Nigeria, stating that they usually disappeared as they came, “because they were never based on anything concrete but on mere fantasy, illusion and grandstanding.” Olaosebikan, who was asked by journalists on how his now popular projection that Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu would be the next president of Nigeria considering the seeming popularity of Peter Obi, maintained that from his experience with the Nigerian youths, they would rather act now based on realities and proven records of achievements having suffered so much in the hands of politicians who had promised them heaven on earth but eventually made life more hellish for them. According to him, “This is not the first time we are witnessing such fleeting euphoria. We had seen pastor politicians who gained temporary traction because of declaration that God asked them to contest for president; in business, we had seen flashes in form of finance houses promising incredible interests; in real estate, we had seen flashes of mortgage firms making impossible offers during the time of ‘everybody come inside’; in medicine, we had witnessed passing euphoria too, where marketers promoted a drug for the cure of all ailments that eventually cured nothing; all hurtled because they were based on fantasies.
