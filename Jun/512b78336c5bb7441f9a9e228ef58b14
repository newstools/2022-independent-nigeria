Shakira has revealed her elderly father has been hospitalised following a ‘bad fall’. The Hips Don’t Lie icon released a statement discussing her father’s health after she was seen in an ambulance, sparking concern from her millions of fans. However Shakira, who recently announced the end of her relationship with the father of her children, has now explained that she was accompanying her father, William Mebarak Chadid, to hospital. -Advertisement- Taking to Twitter, the Colombian musician shared a snap of her kissing her father, who is dressed in a hospital gown and has bruising on his face, and wrote an accompanying message in both Spanish and English. ‘Guys, I’m getting a lot of messages of concern that I was seen in an ambulance in Barcelona recently,’ she began. ‘I just wanted to let you know that those photos are from last weekend (the 28th) when my dad unfortunately had a bad fall and I accompanied him in an ambulance to the hospital where he is recovering now.’ With William thankfully now recovering, Shakira has asked everyone to continue sending their ‘best wishes his way’. She added: ‘Thank you all as always for all of your love and support.’ POLL The singer has faced difficult times of late, recently announcing that she and partner Gerard Piqué have split after more than a decade together. Gerard, who plays for FC Barcelona, and the pop icon first met in 2010 as she worked on her song Waka Waka for the South Africa World Cup. The couple, who never married, have two children together: Milan, nine, and Sasha, seven. They appealed for privacy for their sake in their joint statement this week. They said: ‘We regret to confirm that we are parting ways. ‘For the well-being of our children, who are our highest priority, we ask that you respect their privacy. Thank you for your understanding.’
