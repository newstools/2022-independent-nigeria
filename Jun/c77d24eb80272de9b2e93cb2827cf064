Analysts have wondered how much volume the Purosangue would add to Ferrari’s overall sales. The company sold 11,155 cars in 2021, up from 9,119 the previous year. Ferrari made clear, however, the new model will not have an impact similar to that of the Urus for Lamborghini or the Cayenne for Porsche. “We do not want to double our volumes,” Benedetto Vigna, Ferrari Chief Executive Officer (CEO) said. By comparison, Porsche sold 54,234 cars in 2001, the year before it launched the Cayenne. By 2005 the German brand’s volume was 96,794. Last year Porsche sold a record 301,915 cars, with the Cayenne and its small sibling, the Macan, combining to account for 57 per cent of that total. Lamborghini said this month the Urus became its all-time best-seller, doing in the shortest time in company history. Since its market debut in 2018, 20,000 units of the Urus have been built. Last year the Urus accounted for 60 per cent of Lamborghini’s record annual sales of 8,405. -Advertisement- POLL Ferrari said last month the Purosangue will feature a V-12 aspirated gasoline engine. Galliera added last week that Sports Utility Vehicle (SUV) is expected to “enhance the sport car offer in the Ferrari range.”
