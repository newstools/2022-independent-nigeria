LAGOS – Family members of the late Balogun Sanni Fadeyi in Obafemi/ Owode Local Government Area of Ogun State have staged a peaceful protest over the alleged move to annex their village, Oba-Ayegbami, by suspected land grabbers. They also accused a traditional ruler in the council area, the Olu of Siun, Oba Lawrence Odeyinka, of masterminding the move. Calling on the Ogun State government to intervene so as to maintain law and order in the community, the Fadeyi Family said: “We appeal to the chairman of Obafemi Owode Local Government and the state government to intervene in order to avoid breakdown of law and order in the council area.” The members, consisting of young and old, insisted that Aiyegbami Village, otherwise known as Abule Oba, was not located on Igbore land. Saubana Fadeyi, Chief Kashimawo Ogunbayo and Falilat Mobolaji Kareem, on behalf of the extended family members, noted this while presenting a petition to the Chairman of Obafemi Owode Local Government, Sina Ogunsola, over the issue. The family members were joined by their cousins from the Ajala family, who also faulted the claim. According to them, the new move was informed by ulterior considerations and land speculations. -Advertisement- POLL They said their forebears, from Oba and Imo Community sections of Egbaland, are the rightful owners of the land. “Our forefathers from Oba and Imo sections of Egbaland are the rightful owners of the land.
