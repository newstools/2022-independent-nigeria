The Social Democratic Party (SDP) catches a political big fish in Ekiti State with the defection of a former member of the House of Representatives, Hon Bimbo Daramola from the ruling All Progressives Congress(APC) into the party. Daramola (fondly called congressman) who is the Director-General of Governor Kayode Fayemi Campaign Organisation in 2014 said his decision to join forces with SDP ‘ is never a mistake but a well thought out plan.” The former Federal Lawmaker joined the SDP at ward 2, in his country home Ire -Ekiti on Wednesday, where he was received by the party leaders and ward executives. -Advertisement- Hon. Daramola, though described the decision as painful, however, said that he was left with no better option than to move since his former party had consistently accorded him unfair treatment in spite of his huge sacrifices, and long years of selfless service and loyalty. Daramola said, “Today, it is with a large sense of pain, somewhat disappointed that I turn my back and walk away from the house that we jointly built on strong values, what I thought were the pristine values of Ekiti people and our commitment and dedication to a society that works, held in place by pillars of the creed and ethos of pure love, justice, fairness and unity of purpose. “When I chose to leave the comfort of a predictable and straightforward life in the organized public sector, as a Geologist turned Banker and PR Consultant, where the guarantees of a good life for myself and family and maybe a few others were not in doubt, I had assumed and lived with the impression that I was pursuing a dream to contribute to the building of a society and state where life could be more meaningful for a lot more people.”
