. Two In Abuja, One In Lagos The National Executive of the Nigerian Bar Association (NBA NEC) has created additional two branches of the Association in Abuja and one in Lagos. The NBA NEC at its quarterly meeting in Ilorin Kwara State created the Garki Branch and Nyanya/Karu Branches for Abuja and Surulere Branch for Lagos. Speaking on the new Branches, the NBA President, Olumide Akpata explained that the two new Abuja branches and the Surulere branch in Lagos were created out of the two mega cities for easy administration as the population of lawyers has become unwieldy.
