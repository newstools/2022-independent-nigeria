ABUJA – The Independent National Electoral Commission INEC has expressed deep regrets at the sudden death of Yomi Kareem, a reporter with Nigerian Pilot Newspapers and a very resourceful member of the INEC Press Corps. The death of Yomi Kareem, last Thursday in Lugbe, a suburb of the Abuja Municipal Area Council, had been shrouded in controversy and still subject of police investigation. The electoral body in a statement signed by Barrister Festus Okoye INEC National Commissioner and Chairman Information and Voter Education Committee, said the death of the reporter has remained a mystery, especially that he was one of the Journalists that covered the recent Ekiti Governorship Election. The statement reads: “It is with deep regret that the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) received the shocking news of the death of Mr. Yomi Kareem, a Correspondent with the Pilot newspaper and member of the INEC Press Corps, who passed away on 23rd June 2022. “The Press Corps, of which Mr. Kareem is a member, has worked closely with the Commission over the years, playing its dual role as the watchdog of the democratic process while also keeping the public informed about the Commission’s activities and efforts to improve the electoral system.Mr. Kareem’s professionalism and integrity were always visible in his works and contributions. ” His last official engagement with the Commission was the coverage of the recently concluded Ekiti Governorship election held on 18th June 2022. Indeed, his attributes as a respectable, committed journalist and gentleman will be sorely missed. “We commiserate with his family, colleagues, friends, and management of the Pilot Newspaper on this sad incident. May God give his wife, children, and all those who hold him dear the fortitude to bear the irreplaceable loss and may his gentle soul rest in peace”.
