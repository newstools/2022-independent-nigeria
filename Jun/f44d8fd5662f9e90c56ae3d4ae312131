Former Governor of Enugu State, Senator Chimaroke Nnamani, has sent a message of condolence to the publisher and Chief Executive Officer of Thisday newspapers and Arise Television, Prince Nduka Obaigbena and family over the transition to the great beyond of their matriarch, Princess Margaret Obaigbena. In the message, Senator Nnamani also condoled the government and people of Delta State over the demise of the Princess of Owa kingdom, who passed on at the age of 88. According to the Senator representing Enugu East Senatorial zone in the upper legislative chamber, in a statement, “Mama’s exit is painful but we cannot question the will of God. We are consoled that she left positive footprints in the sands of time. “There is no doubt that her exit has created a huge vacuum in your family, Ika community and Delta state but take solace in the fact that she lived an eventful and accomplished life worthy of emulation. “The avalanche of encomiums on her since her demise is a manifestation of her good deeds while she was alive. “Her good neighbourliness, philanthropy, community services and commitment to peace and unity endeared her to many who came across her. “Your success story and those of your siblings is an eloquent testimony that your mother was a caring, disciplined and responsible woman who taught her children good virtues. “She was a pleasant mother to so many, full of life and hope. She was a devout Christian who promoted evangelism and indeed touched the lives of people in many positive ways.” -Advertisement- POLL Senator Nnamani reminded the bereaved family of the need to uphold those rare attributes of hard work, kindness, honesty, perseverance and courage that their mother was known for.
