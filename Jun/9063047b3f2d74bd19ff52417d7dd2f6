Victor Osimhen, the Napoli of Italy forward, as well as other Nigerians were missing as the Confederation of Africa Football (CAF) released a sixty-man nominee for the annual CAF Awards. Only two Nigerians feature in the shortlist for individual awards which will be held on July 21, 2022, in Rabat, Morocco. The two Nigerians are Simon Moses in the main award for the African Footballer of Year and Akinwunmi Amoo of FC Copenhagen in the Youth Category. Nominees in the women’s category have not been released. The Super Eagles are also glaring absentees in the 10 nominees of their category. But Comoros, The Gambia and Equatorial Guinea made the cut. According to the press statement by CAF, a stakeholder panel made up of Technical Experts, CAF Legends and journalists decided on the list for the various categories taking into consideration the performance of the nominee from September 2021 to June 2022 at all levels. The winners of each category will be decided by a voting panel made up of CAF Technical Committee, media professionals, Head Coaches & Captains of Member Associations and clubs involved in the group stage of the Interclub competitions. The CAF Awards 2022 will be held ahead of the final of Africa’s flagship women’s competitions, TotalEnergies Women’s Africa Cup of Nations Morocco 2022 scheduled to take place between 02 July – 23 July 2022.
