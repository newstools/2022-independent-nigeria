Core Maritime stakeholders have flagged off a Save the Golden Goose (SAGG) campaign, meant to rescue two critical, but failed portions of Apapa Roads, which have currently become a menace to cargo haulage. According to MaritimeFirst report, the two failed portions are located at Ijora when moving between Apapa to Contain; and the Trinity route, when moving from Tin Can to Mile 2, in Lagos. The Maritime First learned that the high-powered group, who are also likely to bear their plea to Abuja, include the Chairperson of the Seaport Terminal Operators Association of Nigeria STOAN, Princess Vicky Haastrup and the Chairman, Association of Maritime Truck Owners AMATO, Chief Remi Ogungbemi. It was gathered that while many of the stakeholders might not be primarily shippers, they expressed genuine concern that the soaring rate of accidents, and the havoc being daily wrecked on lives and cargoes, on the portions, could no longer be ignored. “How do we continue to fold our hands while lives, import and export cargoes are daily wasted in avoidable accidents, in very little portions of the road?”, a stakeholder, who preferred that his name be not mentioned, asked. He maintained that the statistics of wastage already incurred on those little portions were staggering; and insisted that human lives could not be quantified.
