Despite the COVID-19 pandemic’s industry-wide contractions on achieved returns in 2021, Nigeria’s foremost pension fund administrator (PFA), Leadway Pensure PFA, has projected to maintain an average of double digits (DD) increase on its Fund’s returns in 2022. Released in its report in May 2022, the pension service provider is on target to maintain double-digit returns on its entire Retirement Savings Account (RSA) investment portfolios of 12per cent in Fund 1, 11per cent in Fund 2, 10per cent in Fund 3, and 11per cent in Fund 4 by the end of the year 2022 sustaining this dynamic performance trend. In previous years, Leadway PFA recorded a two-year streak of consistent appreciable performance achieving double-digit fund returns on its RSA Funds. As of 2019, Fund 1 achieved a 14per cent return and grew the same to 19per cent in 2020. Fund 2 also improved from a single digit of 9per cent at inception in 2018 to impressively recording a double-digit of 18per cent by 2020. Similarly, Fund 3 and Fund 4 reached double digits in 2019 and 2020 with returns of 13per cent and 14per cent in 2019 to 14per cent as well as 15per cent in 2020 respectively. Speaking on the report and projections for the year, Mr. Lanre Idris, Managing Director/Chief Executive Officer, Leadway Pensure, enthused with excitement that the achieved returns projection is indicative of the organisation’s progressive capacity in fulfilling its financial obligations despite the pandemic-induced global downturn in the investment space in previous years. “As recorded in the May Report of the Retirement Savings Account, we are right on a positive momentum to sustain the constant improvements in returns across all our pension funds by year-end 2022, despite notable setbacks in the previous year. However, global recoveries in the economic environment leading to improved investment possibilities have paved the way for positive progress in returns.”
