The City of Ilorin, the Kwara State capital will, on Thursday play host to members of a pro-democracy group, Kwara Central Volunteers for Saliu Mustapha, a political association supporting the Senatorial aspiration of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Senatorial candidate for the Central District of the state, Saliu Mustapha. The objective of the Thursday rally, according to a statement jointly signed by Comrade Razaq Olokoba Convener and Comrade Mohammed Yusuf, Co-Convener, is to formally and officially endorse the APC candidate, Saliu Mustapha and to galvanize support and canvass for votes for him in the coming general election in 2023. According to the statement, the occasion would serve a triple purposes which are; seeking support for Saliu Mustapha’s success, canvassing votes for Governor AbdulRazq Abdur-Rahmon’s second term in office as well as backing the APC presidential candidate, Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu’s ambition for 2023. While describing Saliu Mustapha as the right material to represent the good people of Kwara State Central Senatorial Zone, the Volunteers also reasoned that Governor Abdur-Razaq’s second term in office is a necessity for continuity of the good works he has started since his assumption of office in 2019. On Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu, the statement pointed out that, the imperative of his presidency from 2023 can never be overemphasised because it would go along in cementing the more, the unity and peaceful co-existence in the project called Nigeria, reasoning that, since the northern coalition has been magnanimous enough to support power shift to the south and particularly to the south-west, the onus is now on the south-west people to do their own part by voting for the APC candidate overwhelmingly. The Volunteers, who expressed confidence in Mustapha enthused that, going by his pedigree and antecedence, he would not disappoint his people, “the entire numerical strength of our members would be deployed across the senatorial district to ensure that his victory is a foregone conclusion ever before the real election.” According to the statement, concentrating the votes on the APC candidates across board would give the country the required leadership that can move the country forward, commending the APC leadership for bringing out the best materials for all the positions to be contested for from the presidency, to the governorship slots down to the federal and state legislative Houses. The organization therefore urged the good people of Kwara State to give their votes to Bola Tinubu as president, Abdur-Razaq as Governor and Mustapha as Senator as well as other candidates of the APC across the country.
