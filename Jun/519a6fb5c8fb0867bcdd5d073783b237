The Allied People’s Movement (APM) has elected its National Chairman, Yusuf Dantalle, as its presidential candidate for the 2023 general election. The party also expelled six suspended National Working Committee (NWC) members and three state chairmen for gross anti-party activities which it alleged brought the party to ridicule and disrepute. Dantalle who is the party’s only presidential candidate was elected by delegates at the party special convention held at its secretariat in Abuja. A statement by Oyedeyi Adebayo, APM National Secretary, said that Dantalle “will now contest the 2023 presidential election with Bola Tinubu (APC), Atiku Abubakar (PDP), Peter Obi (Labour Party) and Chekwas Okorie (APGA).” APM equally set up a five-man committee to investigate its finances – expenditure and income; with another five-man committee set up to review and amend the party’s constitution for future elections. Though no date has been fixed for the upcoming convention, the statement disclosed that new executives will emerge from the process; adding that delegates also set up a seven-man committee to plan the exercise.
