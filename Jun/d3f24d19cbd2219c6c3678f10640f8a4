Manchester United have signed teenage goalkeeper Elyh Harrison from Stevenage. The 16-year-old has been named among their 14 first-year scholars for 2022 and will look to make the progression into the under-18s under the tutelage of club coaches. Last season, United’s youngsters lifted the FA Youth Cup after beating Nottingham Forest at Old Trafford in May. The team also finished third in the under-18s Premier League. Harrison had already been training with the first team at Stevenage and is expected to progress through the academy ranks. The Boro’s chairman, Phil Wallace, congratulated the shot stopper on his move. He told the club’s website: “Our very best wishes go to Elyh, and we will follow his career with interest. “This is the fourth young player in four years that has been signed from Stevenage’s Academy to a Premier League club.” With the United academy operating in its own capacity, this does not count as Erik ten Hag’s first signing.
