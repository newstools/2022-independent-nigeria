MAKURDI – Daniel Gbabo, Senior Special Assistant to Governor Samuel Ortom of Benue State on Secondary and Tertiary Education, has stated that those calling on the National Chairman of the Peoples’ Democratic Party (PDP), Senator Iyorchia Ayu, to step aside do not have the party at heart. He was reacting to calls that Senator Ayu be made to step aside and his position be filled by a Southerner. Gbabo, a former Senior Special Assistant to Governor Ortom on Political Affairs, noted that so far, Senator Ayu has not failed in the mandate of resuscitating the party and subsequently wresting power from the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) the nation. -Advertisement- He stated that the PDP national chairman was on the right path having midwifed a successful national convention, even as he likened the call to asking a surgeon to step aside in the middle of a critical operation. In a statement personally signed by Gbabo and made available to Daily Independent in Makurdi on Thursday, the governor’s aide said, “Those agitating or calling on him to step aside are likely not doing it from an angle of patriotism. “The National Chairman of our great party, Dr. Iyorchia Ayu, cannot step aside now simply because a presidential candidate, in the person of Alhaji Abubakar Atiku, has emerged from the North where the National Chairman hails from. “Asking the National Chairman to step aside and be replaced by a Southerner will mean asking a competent surgeon to step aside in the middle of critical surgery, because you think the patient has survived already. “Dr. Ayu has a mandate and his mandate is to usher in the rescue team, stepping aside midway is not included in the mandate. POLL “Atiku’s victory at the just-concluded National Convention is a strong pointer and indication that the team to rescue Nigeria is indeed formidable and focus-driven.”
