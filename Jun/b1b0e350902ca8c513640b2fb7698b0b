LAGOS – The Coalition of Maritime Transport Unions and Associations (COMTUA) has written to the Minister of Transport over alleged illegal towing, harassment and extortion by officials of the Nigerian Shipper’s Council. Prince Aroyewun Adeyinka, COMTUA National President, in a letter to the minister, a copy which was made available to Sunday INDEPENDENT, titled ‘Illegal Towing, Harassment and Extortion by the Port Standing Task Team (PSTT)’, accused officials of the Nigerian Shipper’s Council of perpetrating nefarious activities at the ports. In the letter, the COMTUA boss drew the minister’s attention to the illegal activities of the PSTT as follows as currently constituted. According to the letter, “The committee has constituted itself into a traffic management unit whose only interest is to impound vehicles that have not violated any traffic regulation. “This they do regularly and even this morning. Our members with legitimate call up documents en route to the port were arrested by men of this team in the queue.” The COMTUA boss maintained that various complaints by the association against illegal checkpoint and extortion on the road had not received attention, rather the business of extortion from trucks had become their priority. According to him, “The PSTT in connivance with some unions and individuals have constituted themselves into a team to frustrate the business of our members. “We are pleading with your office to look into the excesses of this committee to forestall a predictable breakdown of law and order on the port corridor. -Advertisement- POLL “While state and nonstate  actors extort and cause traffic without check, our trucks and drivers who are victims, are made to serve suffer double jeopardy in the hands of PSTT.” He urged the minister to act fast to save his members from the illegal activities of the PSTT members at the ports.
