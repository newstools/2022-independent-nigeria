YENAGOA  – The apex Ijaw socio-cultural organisation, Ijaw National Congress (INC), has con­demned in very strong terms the unprovoked Sunday’s attack and brutal killing of innocent worshippers by gunmen at the Saint Fran­cis Catholic Church in Owo, Ondo State. The INC President, Pro­fessor Benjamin Okaba, in a statement issued on Tuesday, described the attack as “cal­lous, despicable, reprehensi­ble and dastardly, which all sane people who value the sanctity of human life should condemn.” He said that the organised carnage in Owo had further exposed the parlous security architecture operated by the Federal Government, adding that “citizens everywhere now live in trepidation as their safe­ty can no longer be guaranteed by a government they elected.” Okaba said, “The grue­some killing of worshippers in broad daylight, mostly women and children, by the blood-thirsty and depraved gunmen, signposts the intrac­table insecurity challenges facing the Nigerian state. “The unabating threat to lives and property in the coun­try has continued to assume a more frightening dimension in geometrical proportions, putting the unity of the coun­try at risk. “The wanton killings in Owo have brought to the fore once more the need for a re­structured Nigeria to give the constituent nationalities full autonomy over the protection of their lives and property and the management of their resources. This is the mini­mum that can guarantee the corporate existence of Nigeria to avoid the growing agitations for secession. There is no doubt Nigeria is fast becoming a failed state.” He extended condolences of the INC leadership and Ijaw people to Governor Rotimi Akeredolu, the gov­ernment and good people of Ondo State, and the Catholic Church over the mayhem. The Ijaw leader also com­miserated with the bereaved families of the victims and prayed Almighty God to comfort them while granting eternal repose to the souls of the departed.
