The President, African Insurers Association (AIO), Mr Tope Smart, has said that the growth opportunities in the African continent remain high, largely driven by a young and growing population with increasing utilisation of technology. He said this in his keynote tagged: The AIO at 50: A Call for African Insurance Renaissance delivered at the ongoing AIO 2022 Conference in Nairobi Kenya. According to the number one insurer in africa, despite the additional pressures of unrelenting regulatory and insurance accounting changes, and the huge costs associated with the changes, there are also some positive developments and opportunities for growth. He submitted that the younger generation is looking for new ways to connect and protect, bringing affordability and access to the continent. “These market conditions and dynamics are likely to continue to give rise to Insurtechs who, through technological innovation, are able to tackle consumer awareness and resistance and address inefficiencies within the financial system for product development, distribution, and settlement,” he posited. “Having looked at what the African insurance industry looked like yesterday, permit me share with you, what we think the industry should look like in the next 50 years. The areas we need to lay emphasis on for a better, more vibrant insurance industry. The list is not exhaustive and I’m sure the imminent panelists here will enlighten us more. “The insurance sector can play a crucial role in financial and economic development. By reducing uncertainty and limiting the adverse effects of large losses, the sector can encourage new investments, innovation, and competition,” he said.
