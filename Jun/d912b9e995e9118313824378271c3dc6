She wrote: “My marriage is working and will continue to work in Jesus’ name, Amen.” Recall that earlier today, JJC Skillz, announced his separation from his wife, Funke Akindele-Bello after six years as a couple, via his official Instagram handle. He wrote, “Dear Friends and family, I need to let you know that Funke and I have separated. While it lasted, we shared a lot of things together and have created two beautiful children. “The last two years have been extremely difficult for us. I know I have tried my best to fix things but I believe it is beyond repair now. months ago and at Funke’s insistence, I moved out of the house and apart from AMVCA have not been able to get Funke to sit down in an amicable manner to discuss the future of our relationship.” “I’m making this announcement so that the public is clear that we both are pursuing separate lives. We still have issues that need to be addressed such as the custody and wellbeing of our children which is paramount as well as business interests which need to be disentangled but I have no doubt that these will be resolved one way or the other,” he added.
