He said music, for him, is a calling and he has answered and he is moving on with the ministry. No doubt, he is hoping up his game and making sure he keeps doing it professionally. Recently, he was quoted in an interview saying that he is not competing with anyone rather he would keep focusing on his own grind. “I am totally focused on my own grind and it is worth it. I do not have the time to check on others. I believe the sky is wide for all birds to fly or soar higher. I am soaring high and nothing can stop me,” he said. -Advertisement- He, however, noted that music, for him, is a call and he is sticking to it promptly. “I have answered my call and I am building on it steadily.
