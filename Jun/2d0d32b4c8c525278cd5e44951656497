Former lawmaker Shehu Sani has reacted to the decision of the Senate on Wednesday to send a delegation to London over a case of alleged organ harvest against Senator Ike Ekweremadu. Recall that Ekweremadu and his wife were apprehended and charged to court last week in the United Kingdom over the alleged offense. In response to the senator’s ordeal, the upper chamber of the national assembly after a series of deliberation today, set up a committee that will visit the embattled senator and see to the alleged offense. Reacting to this Senator Sani tweeted: “Ekweremadu deserves all the necessary consular support he needs. The response of the NASS is in the right direction. But same should be extended to Sunday Igboho.” Recall that Igboho was arrested and detained in Cotonou, Benin Republic, in July 2021.
