Harry Kane and Jessica Naz have been nominated in the Professional Football Association’s (PFA) end of season awards. Harry joins Liverpool trio Virgil van Dijk, Sadio Mane and Mo Salah, Kevin de Bruyne of City and United’s Cristiano Ronaldo on the shortlist for the Players’ Player award. The England skipper scored 27 goals in 50 appearances in all competitions as we qualified for the Champions League with a fourth-placed finish in the Premier League last season. That took him to 248 goals in 386 appearances for us, and he’s now less than 20 short of our all-time record goalscorer Jimmy Greaves (266). -Advertisement- Milestones continue to arrive for the striker throughout 2021/22, including his 250th career goal, his 300th goal for Club and country, becoming the all-time record away goalscorer in the Premier League (now up to 96) and moving into the Premier League top five goalscorers, now on 183. He also teamed-up with Heung-Min Son for the most goal combinations in Premier League history, now up to 41. Harry, 28, won the PFA Young Player of the Year award in 2014/15, but has yet to win the Players’ Player award. Our last winner was Gareth Bale in 2012/13. Jessica’s nomination is another piece of history after a memorable campaign – Spurs Women’s first PFA nomination. The attacking midfielder shone again as we finished in our highest-ever position in women’s football, fifth in the Women’s Super League, and reached the semi-final of a senior competition for the first time in the Continental Cup. Jess’s performances have already been recognised – she was named Women’s Young Player of the Year at this season’s London Football Awards in March. She’s up against Lauren Hemp (City), Lauren James (Chelsea), Frida Maanum (Arsenal), Ella Toone (United) and Maya Le Tissier (Brighton).
