Former Manchester United midfielder Nemanja Matic is holding talks with Roma over joining the Italian side on a free transfer, The Athletic understands. If completed, the move would see Matic reunited with Roma manager Jose Mourinho for a third time. Roma are proposing an initial one-year deal, with the 33-year-old triggering an extension if he makes a certain number of appearances. -Advertisement- He will replace Henrikh Mkhitaryan in the Roma squad, who is on the verge of signing with Inter Milan as a free agent. Matic left Old Trafford this summer after a five year spell in Manchester, having joined United from Chelsea for £40 million. Mourinho signed him on both occasions. His fortunes at United were harmed by Mourinho’s departure in December 2018, with successor Ole Gunnar Solskjaer favouring a double midfield pivot featuring Scott McTominay and Fred. The Serbian international made 15 Premier League starts this season, failing to score and only contributing four assists. However, his career appears to have been revitalised by Roma’s interest, with Mourinho desiring an experienced player who knows how he operates — and who will not take away from the club’s transfer budget. POLL Roma won the Europa Conference League last season — Mourinho’s fifth European title — after beating Feyenoord 1-0 in the final. Matic will be expected to partner 27-year-old Italian international Bryan Cristante in the Roma midfield.
