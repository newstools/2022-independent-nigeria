She said, “I have never failed in leadership,” adding that she believes “the time is now for the youths to take over leadership.” According to her, contrary to speculations and despite her being a subject of controversy, the decision to join politics was well thought out and is one she has worked towards for at least three years. “I am prepared for anything, truthfully. I have had three years to work on this, its not something that I just came out or emerged with. We’ve had a lot of time to work on this and for this. Criticism, I am ready, non-criticism I am ready. So, it doesn’t matter where the questions are coming from. When asked if she sees any chance for the ADC in Rivers State, she said “there’s always a chance for everything.” Speaking further, the single mother of one said, “Rivers is not a PDP state. The state is not run by the PDP but by the citizens. We need to send the right message to the people of Rivers State.” -Advertisement- POLL Meanwhile, the ADC governorship candidate, Tonye Ibraye has on Friday confirmed Dikeh as his running mate in a statement posted on Instagram.
