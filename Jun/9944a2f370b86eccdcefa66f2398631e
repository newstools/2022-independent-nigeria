Canadian-based Nigerian rapper, Selick Idahosa better known as Sleek has shared his two cents on what he would love his colleagues in the Nigerian music space to do differently. The International rapper who has been dominating the international music scene and is set to visit his motherland soon, in a recent interview gave some insights on what to be wary of in the music industry and as an artist how to be original.He said “I feel like we barely have any good rappers to push the whole rap game and take it to the next level because I know Nigerians love rap, you can tell when Americans perform in Lagos the love is way crazier than the love they get in America. Also, there will never be another MI or Iceprince, unless I come and take over which is my main goal. I want artists to stop copying the western side of the world, cause when we hear your music and you sound like us(International rappers) won’t take you seriously because it doesn’t sound authentic, it is like you’re forcing it and we can tell, there’s so much of it already. Perfect example, my homie Focalistic is killing it right now and he is just being himself, when you hear Focalistic you hear South Africa, not America and the world can appreciate it because he is true to himself. But in Nigeria, I feel like artists are stuck and still struggling to break that international barrier for rap so we need that and I am that guy”. Sleek who describes his genre as a mix of Rap and hip hop with a bit of melody is an indie artist and has tracks such as ‘Feel the vibe’, ‘The Plug’, ‘Proceed with caution’, ‘Find me’ among others in his catalog, he further hinted on the message he hopes to pass with his sound.“I would love to show the youths that you can fully be yourself, you don’t have to follow any trends and you can still be a cool person without following the trend of being a gangster adding that “it is good to experiment and try new things”, said Sleek. Speaking on how he hopes to break into the oversaturated Nigerian music space and what rap lovers in the industry should expect, he said “I want to show them that they have a new king in town that was born in Benin and raised in Canada, I want to show people overseas(Canada) how we really do things in Naija and the lifestyle since all the attention is on Nigeria already. As for my fans and lovers of rap music in Nigeria, they should prepare for new energy that the industry has been missing coupled with plenty of surprise collaborations since everyone is within arms reach”, he added.
