Arsenal transfer target Gabriel Jesus has been offered to both Real Madrid and Atletico Madrid. The Manchester City striker looks set to leave the Etihad this summer with Erling Haaland’s arrival likely to push him further down the pecking order in Pep Guardiola’s side. Arsenal are eager to sign him with reports suggesting the 25-year-old is willing to join the Gunners despite there being no Champions League football on offer next season. -Advertisement- But according to Cadena Ser, the Brazil international has also now been offered to the Madrid giants. With Jesus seeking a €5million-a-year contract, Atletico will not pursue a move. However, Real Madrid are interested and do not believe City’s asking price – thought to be £50million – will be a problem. But the Champions League winners do face another major obstacle with La Liga sides only permitted to have three non-EU players registered. Real had hoped for a slot to open up with Vinicius Jr applying for a Spanish passport but that process is said to be taking longer than expected. That could leave Arsenal leading the race for his signature with strengthening his options up front a priority for Mikel Arteta at Arsenal this summer. POLL Last season, Arsenal managed just 61 goals in 38 matches and fell away during the closing stages of a campaign that ended on a disappointing note as Tottenham snatched fourth place ahead of them. Jesus is reportedly ready to agree to a move to north London with Arsenal to offer a salary worth around £200,000-a-week in order to seal the deal. Speaking after he scored for Brazil against South Korea in a 5-1 win last week, Jesus suggested a decision could be imminent. He said: ‘I’m looking to see what’s best for me and above all, for my career. From Tuesday, we’ll see what is the best.’
