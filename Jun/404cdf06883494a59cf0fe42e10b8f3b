LAGOS – The 2022 Nigeria DigitalSENSE Africa Forum (NDSF) on Internet Governance for Development (IG4D) has been scheduled to hold in June this year at the esteemed Welcome Centre Hotel, International Airport Road, Lagos. The Nigeria DigitalSENSE Africa forum is hosted annually by the international award-winning ITREALMS Media under its DigitalSENSE Africa Forum series and an At-Large Structure (ALS) at the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN); as part of efforts for shaping the future of the Internet. The Group Executive Editor and Editor-in-Chief of ITREALMS Media Group, Mr. Remmy Nweke, revealed that DigitalSENSE Africa, a social enterprise arm of the media entity, will focus the 2022 NDSF series on the theme: ‘5G: Enthroning Internet Governance for Digital Economy’ and has been slated for Thursday, June 9 by 9 am at the Adams Hall, Welcome Centre Hotels, International Airport Road, Ikeja, Lagos. This year’s theme, he said, will be examined in depth from the prism of a safer, secure and equitable world with a positive future. He pointed out that the recent auction of the Fifth Generation (5G) in the country, was a step at enthroning Internet Governance for Development (IG4D), even as the nation prepares for the 2023 General Elections anticipated to be driven largely by the Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs). Nweke noted that all 5G wireless devices are expected to be connected to the Internet and telephone networks; with the main advantage of the new networks offering greater bandwidth and higher download speeds, to name a few. 5G, he equally said, brings about incredible benefits to mitigate many challenges not limited to growing digital divides, cyber threats, and human rights violations moreso online. “To leverage the burgeoning 5G interests, ITREALMS Media through its digital rights initiative of the annual Nigeria DigitalSENSE Forum (NDSF) series on Internet Governance for Development (IG4D) will be assembling Nigerian stakeholders to explore this digital dividend this year,” he declared.
