AWKA – Anambra State Commissioner for Culture, Tourism and Entertainment, Mr. Don Onyenji, has stated that government has eventually clamped down and completely sealed the hotel where underage girls were used as sex slaves, prostitutes and baby sellers at Nkpor Idemili-North Local Government Area of the state. The commissioner stated this during an exclusive interview with our correspondent in his office in Awka. He said his ministry has gone to the hotel and discovered that the said location does not qualify to be called a hotel because it didn’t meet the criteria for classification of hotels in the state. He said the place was not certified and licensed to operate as a hotel in the state and it is also not captured in government’s list of hotels operating in the state adding that it is an illegitimate hotel which was the remote reason illicit and all forms of criminal activities held sway there. Onyenji further disclosed that the necessary organs of government have conducted their checks on the hotel and that some arrests have been made at the location while government still keeps an eye on the facility while it is sealed. He however revealed that there is a strategy in place to revalidate all the hotels in Anambra State to ensure that they are operating with licence, legally and equally standardise the tourism industry which he said includes operations of hotels to make sure that their operations met global standards.
