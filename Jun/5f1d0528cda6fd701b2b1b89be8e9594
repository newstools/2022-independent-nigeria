Prophet Timothy Abass Arabambi, the General Overseer, Christ Apostolic Church (CAC), Reformation Land (Ile-Atunse), Olunloyo Akanran Road, Ibadan, Nigeria, has called on the Federal Government to address the hard times in the country. Prophet Arabambi who disclosed this in a statement, noted that Nigerians had been really angry due to the hunger in the land. The cleric further said that the rich had been groaning, while the poor who hadbeen becoming poorer by the day, had also been crying, stressing that living in Nigeria had become rough and tough. Arabambi also noted that many heads of families had been incapacitated because of the hard times, as many breadwinners had no financial ability to ‘win bread’ again, even as he urged the state and federal governments need to wake up and address these issues. The cleric added that, fortunately, President Muhammadu Buhari had repeatedly said that he was aware that that Nigerians had been suffering, adding that not doing anything to assuage their suffering was painful, hence, the Federal Government must, of necessity, do something urgently to make jobs available to the youth and immediately provide food for hungry Nigerians. Arabambi also maintained that the prevailing economic situation in the country had adversely affected the living standard of the people, leading to pains, hardship and sorrow, even as he urged all Christians not to give in to hopelessness and despair, as our God was in control of the situation. Arabambi added that both Scripture and history had it that that God acted in defence of His people in similar situations in the past, as, He (God) would remain the same forever and would surely intervene and deliver His people who must keep hope aliv
