Amid the COVID-19 crisis, the global market for Power System Simulator is projected to reach US$1.2 billion by 2024, registering a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 6.9% over the analysis period. The United States represents the largest regional market for Power System Simulator, accounting for an estimated 24.6% share of the global total. The market is projected to reach US$332.7 Million by the close of the analysis period. The Middle East is forecast to emerge as the fastest growing regional market with a CAGR of 9.2% over the analysis period. The market is witnessing stable growth led by the strong growth in power sector, and increase in power generation capacities across the world. Using the simulators, it is possible to carry out testing of different system topologies in industrial power systems, commercial facilities, renewable energy systems, utility transmission systems, and railway power systems. Rising investments into power infrastructure development in developing economies and the growing efforts to cut down overall cost and time involved in projects are fueling market growth. Also fostering growth in the market is the increasing investments in smart power technologies and the constant rise in adoption of IoT (Internet of Things) and cloud platforms for simulation of electrical power systems. By type of module, the load flow module segment represents the largest segment in the global power systems simulator market. Load flow (power flow) analysis is the computational procedure used for studying normal steady state operation of power systems. The load flow analysis is mainly aimed at ascertaining the steady state operating characteristics of a power system with regard to a specific load and voltage conditions. Using load flow analysis, it is possible to analyze power flow and calculate voltage drops in a reliable and accurate manner.
