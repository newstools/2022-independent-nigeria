Nigeria’s Minister of State for Labour and Employment, Festus Keyamo has praised President Muhammadu Buhari of giving the kind of leadership the opposition People’s Democratic Party (PDP) couldn’t get in 2007 under the leadership of President Olusegun Obasanjo. Kayamo, who stated this while reacting to the just concluded presidential primary election of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), claimed that President Buhari was able to complete a transparent process to pick a possible successor, which according to him, was devoid of imposition and interference. In a post on his verified Twitter handle @fkeyamo, the junior minister referred to the APC governors from the Northern region as the heroes of the just concluded convention, saying they reflected the extreme complexity of Nigeria in their decision to move power down South. He tweeted: “OBJ are you watching? The kind of leadership OBJ failed to give @OfficialPDPNig in 2007 is what PMB just provided for the world to see: complete transparent process to pick a possible successor; no IMPOSITION; NO INTERFERENCE; who’s the democrat now? Congratulations @officialABAT “The heroes of APC Convention are the Northern Govs who reflected the extreme complexity of Nigeria in their decision to move power down South; and PMB who proved to his disciples that he is EVERYTHING but what he has been so unfairly accused of; congratulations again @officialABAT.”
