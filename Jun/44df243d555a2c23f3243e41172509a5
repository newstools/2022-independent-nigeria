As the 2023 general elections gathered momentum, the presidential candidate of the New Nigeria People Party (NNPP), Rabiu Kwankwaso on Friday visited the Governor of Rivers State and chieftain of the People’s Democratic Party (PDP), Nyesom Wike. Also present at the meeting was former Ekiti State Governor, Ayodele Fayose, while the purpose of the visit is yet unclear, it may not be unconnected to the 2023 general elections. In the past few days, political players such as the presidential candidate of the Labour Party(LP), Peter Obi, Senate Minority Leader, Philip Aduda and other PDP stakeholders in the state have visited Governor Wike. Others who have visited him recently include Governor Dave Umahi of Ebonyi State, Governor Bala Mohammed of Bauchi State, former Minister of Niger Delta Affairs, Godsday Orubebe, and former Attorney General and Minister of Justice, Mohammed Adoki.
