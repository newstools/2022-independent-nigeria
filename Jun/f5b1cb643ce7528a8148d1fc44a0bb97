NNEWI  – An octogenarian and the coordinator of past presidents general of town unions in Dunukofia Local Government Area of Anambra State, Chief Jasper Azodo, has appealed to Governor Chukwuma Soludo to intervene in Ifitedunu town union crisis by directing that free and fair election be conducted in the town. Azodo, in a message he sent to the governor, he accused state Commissioner for Local Government and Chieftaincy Matters, Chief Collins Nwabunwanne, of working for the sacked president general of the community, Chief Uchenna Okoye Orangwuncha. Azodo said a delegation of the town he led to see the chief of staff to the governor, assured them that the governor had directed that town union caretaker committees be discontinued in the state. The chief of staff, said Azodo, referred them to the commissioner for Local Government and Town Union Matters. However, Azodo said they found out that the commissioner was working for the sacked PG and had assured him that he would return him as the PG of Ifitedunu based on a letter he wrote to the commissioner. The octogenarian said they were not put on notice on the petition written by the former PG and when the commissioner was allegedly boasting that he would restore the sacked PG. The commissioner was said to have claimed that the aide to the governor on Town Unions Matters had recommended that the sacked PG be returned, a claim the aide had stoutly denied. “Nobody was put on notice, neither did they write the villagers or the elders, the leaders, Board of Trustees (BoT). The commissioner now went on to brag that he will restore the sacked PG because he is his friend and that his removal was illegal even without hearing from the other parties,” said Azodo.
