Charlton Athletic have reached an agreement with Swindon Town manager Ben Garner to take over at The Valley, The Athletic understands. Charlton, who finished 13th in League One last season, have been looking for a new manager since Johnnie Jackson left upon the expiration of his contract in May. It is understood that Garner has agreed personal terms with Charlton, with the League One side also agreeing on a compensation package with Swindon. -Advertisement- Negotiations continue over Garner’s backroom staff. Garner, 42, has impressed since becoming Swindon boss last summer. At the time of his appointment the club only had seven players left on the books, but Garner led the club to an unlikely sixth-place finish and a place in the League Two play-offs. Swindon won the first leg of their play-off semi-final 2-1 against Port Vale, who finished third in the table, only to lose the second leg 1-0 and the tie on penalty kicks. Port Vale then secured promotion to League One with a 3-0 victory over Mansfield at Wembley. POLL Swindon were meanwhile dealt a blow when director of football Ben Chorley resigned from his role at the club last week. Chorley was appointed in July 2021 having previously served as a recruitment scout and recommended the appointment of Garner last summer.
