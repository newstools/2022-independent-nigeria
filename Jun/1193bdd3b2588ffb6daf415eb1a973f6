 BENIN – The Edo State governor, Mr. Godwin Obaseki, has proceed­ed on his annual leave and has transferred powers to his Dep­uty, Rt. Hon. Comrade Philip Shaibu, to act in his stead while he is away. In a statement, Special Ad­viser to the Governor on Media Projects, Crusoe Osagie, said the governor had written to the Edo State Assembly, to intimate it on the development. He said: “The governor has proceeded on his annual leave and has transferred power to his deputy, Rt. Hon. Comrade Philip Shaibu. The Edo State House of Assembly has been duly informed about the devel­opment.” This would be the second time the governor had trans­ferred power to his deputy, further cementing the admin­istration’s respect for democrat­ic ideals as enshrined in the 1999 constitution.
