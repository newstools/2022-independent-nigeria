Team Nigeria has won one gold and two silver medals after Day two of the ongoing 22nd African Athletics Championship holding in Mauritius. Sprint hurdler, Tobiloba Amusan fulfilled expectations as she raced home first in the 100m hurdles to ensure Nigeria is among the eight countries that have won gold at the event. High jumper Adeshina Temitope and the 4x400m mixed relay team also ended the second day of competition with silver medals. While Adeshina lost the high jump to Ghana’s Yeboah Rose on countback after the three medalists cleared 1.79m, the Mixed Relay team had to rely on the experience of Patience Okon George, who earlier qualified for the individual 400m, to come from a possible fourth to second. South Africa and Kenya top the medal table with three gold each with the former amassing more silver (four) and bronze medals (six) than Kenya (1 and 3) with Botswana third with two gold medals. Meanwhile, Nigeria has qualified for the final of the men and women’s 4x100m event. The men’s team came third (40.15) in the second semifinal heat to secure one of the three automatic slots on offer for the final, and the women’s team managed to get over the line as one of the two fastest ‘losers’ with their 46.30s performance. On Friday, Patience Okon George will be hoping to become the first Nigerian woman since 2014 to win the 400m gold and the 30-year-old will attempt to win her first major senior individual title running from lane three. Nigerians will also be hoping Onyekwere Chioma translates her top-ranked position in the event this season to gold. Onyekwere is the defending champion and will be seeking to extend Nigeria’s dominance in the event and ensure a fifth straight win.
