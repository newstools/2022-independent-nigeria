Commercial motorcycle (Okada) riders and Lagos State Task Force were reportedly involved in a clash in the Idi Araba area of the State. The Lagos government banned motorcycle operations in Apapa, Eti Osa, Ikeja, Lagos Island, Surulere, and Lagos Mainland local governments since June 1, 2022. Reacting to the face-off between the Lagos Police Command and the Okada riders, the Police assured residents of safety. Public Relations Officer, Benjamin Hundeyin denied reports that the riders fought security personnel, according to Daily Post reports. “The Taskforce went well prepared. They (riders) were just causing a scene after Taskforce left with some of their impounded motorcycles.” Hundeyin said the Rapid Response Squad (RRS) and men from the Area Command have been drafted to the scene.
