LOKOJA – The Board of Directors, the National Inland Waterways Authority (NIWA) has promised to deploy resources at her disposal to make the nation’s 10,000km-waterways navigable throughout the year. The Board Chairperson, Senator Binta Masi-Garba, made the promise on Tuesday during the inaugural meeting of the board at the NIWA Headquarters in Lokoja. Masi-Garba expressed regrets that though “Nigeria is richly blessed with more than 10,000km Waterways, only 3,800km out of it is being navigated all year round. “As a board, it’s our mandate and that of the authority to make the entire 10,000km waterways navigable all year round to provide an alternative mode of transportation for the evacuation of goods and passengers. “This is a big task placed on the authority; therefore, all hands must be on deck to achieve the desired goals. The board, as a neutral platform for dialogue and collaboration as well as a place to openly share ideas, and experiences and discuss solutions, will from time to time bring together stakeholders, operators and multilateral agencies and academics to discuss solutions.
