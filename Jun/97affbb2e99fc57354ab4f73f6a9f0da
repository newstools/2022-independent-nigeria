The Lagos State government on Tuesday dismissed the anxiety that has followed the planned enforcement of the ban on commercial motorcy­cles, popularly called okada, in six local government ar­eas from today. The local government areas are Surulere, Lagos Island, Lagos Mainland, Apapa, Eti-Osa and Ikeja. A statement by Gbenga Omotoso, Commissioner for Information and Strate­gy, Lagos State, said the law enforcement agencies went on a road show on Tuesday to assure the public that the ban, which was announced by Governor Babajide San­wo-Olu on May 18, after a meeting with the Commis­sioner of Police, Area Com­manders and Divisional Po­lice Officers, will be enforced without any compromise. -Advertisement- “There is no need for any anxiety over the enforce­ment of the ban, which has been hailed by the majority of Lagosians as a reinforce­ment of the Lagos Traffic Law 2012 (amended in 2018). “The government wish­es to advise all law-abiding citizens to go about their businesses without any fear whatsoever as measures have been put in place to forestall any disturbance. Lagosians and visitors are urged to cooperate with the law enforcement agencies in our collective interest”, the statement read.
