The International Institute of Tropical Agriculture (IITA), Ibadan, and Mastercard Foundation have engaged the organised private sector to create profitable partnerships with youth-led agribusinesses to transform and revolutionize the agricultural industry and unlock opportunities in the sector. Both organizations made this known at the ‘The Agribusiness Investment Forum” organized by Innovative Youth in Agriculture (I-Youth) held on Saturday, June 18, 2022. Hilde Koper, the Deputy Director-General, Corporate Services, IITA, while speaking at the event, explained that though the institute has done a lot in scaling technologies and innovations while providing the much-needed capacity, the knowledge, and skills required to attract youth participation in agriculture, there is support from investors to help retain their interest in the sector. While singling out Mastercard Foundation for providing necessary funding for agribusiness training, Koper stated that it has become significant for the private sector to come in by offering loans or microcredit to youth-led enterprises to scale their businesses. She stressed that successful youth-led agribusinesses are also a viable employment opportunity for Nigerian Youth. Chidinma Lawanson, the Country Head, Mastercard Foundation-Nigeria, also speaking at the occasion, stated that the Foundation aims to leverage the youth population in Africa to deliver on the target of providing 7 million dignified and fulfilling jobs in the agricultural sector, noting that IITA is a strategic partner in the realization of this overall objective. “We remain committed to working with IITA to train the youth to have linkages to financial services and work opportunities. Also, create that access to market to ensure that there are no goods lost by evaluating the entire value chain from production to micro processing, warehousing , and IITA has been a strong partner in achieving this,” she said. While admitting that youth tend to be more attracted to the creative industries than agriculture, she said the narrative seems to be changing for the Agric sector in recent times, particularly with the introduction of technologies and innovation by strategic partners.
