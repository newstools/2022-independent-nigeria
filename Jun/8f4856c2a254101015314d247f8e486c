Leicester City midfielder Youri Tielemans has suggested he will consider a move away from the King Power Stadium as speculation over a possible move to Arsenal continues. The Belgium international was a reported target of Gunners manager Mikel Arteta throughout last season after helping the Foxes win the FA Cup in May 2021. Tielemans is now approaching the final 12 months of his current contract and would be able to negotiate a pre-contract agreement with a club outside of England from January. That could force Leicester to consider any offers during the summer transfer window and Tielemans has admitted he could ‘have to listen to other opportunities’ as he assesses his next move. Speaking on international duty with Belgium, the midfielder said: “That is not out of the question (leaving Leicester). I feel very good at Leicester, I was welcomed with open arms from day one. I give everything for the club until the last day. “But of course you have to listen to other opportunities, you have to look at your career, and sometimes you have to make choices. Maybe one will come my way.” After joining the Foxes on loan from French club Monaco, Tielemans has gone to make 158 appearances for Brendan Rodgers’ side – but is one of several players that could depart the club this summer as the former Liverpool boss looks to freshen up his squad. A recent report has suggested Gunners manager Arteta is convinced by the midfielder and Arsenal are growing ‘increasingly confident’ a deal can be struck despite Tielemans’ preference to move to a club competing in next season’s Champions League. POLL A report in the Mirror has stated the Belgian would consider a move to the Emirates Stadium and his contract situation means a bid of £25million could be enough to secure a deal.
