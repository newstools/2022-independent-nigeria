LAGOS  – Accident Investigation Bureau – Nigeria (AIB-N) has said that its safety recommendations are not for reprimanding institutions or organisations in the sector, rather to prevent recurrence of such serious incident or accident. A statement by Mr. Tunji Oketunbi, the General Manager, Public Affairs, AIB-N, specifically said that its immediate safety recommendations in the preliminary report on the serious incident involving Azman Air’s Boeing 737- 500 of January 3, 2019, which was not actioned by the Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority (NCAA) was not an attack on the regulator, but just part of its responsibility to provide final reports. Oketunbi said that the investigator’s responsibility was to investigate and make safety recommendations, while the civil aviation authority by law is not bound to implement any or all its recommendations. Oketunbi insisted that the portion of its report that stated “no from NCAA” was not an attack on the regulatory agency as speculated, but a standard practice in line with the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) Annex 13. He said: “Our attention has been drawn to reports from a section of the media on the recent accident reports released by the Accident Investigation Bureau, Nigeria. “The bureau had expressed in one of its reports recently published that it issued an immediate safety recommendation in the preliminary report on the serious incident involving Azman Air Boeing 737-500 of January 3, 2019, which was not actioned by the Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority (NCAA). “This appeared to have been misinterpreted in some media reports, thereby giving an impression that the report was an attack on the regulatory body. It should be noted that while it is the statutory responsibility of the AIB-N to investigate and make safety recommendations, the Civil Aviation Authority is by law not bound to implement any or all the recommendations where it deems it either unnecessary, time barred or impracticable to do so.”
