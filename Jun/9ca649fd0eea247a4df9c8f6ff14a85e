As the National continued with the search for a violence-free society, the Interfaith Mediation Council IMC has challenged parents to nurture their children and wards by the living by examples as an antipode against violence and extrememism. The IMC in a two-day Review meeting for members of EWER Response Plans/Structure Engagement for CMMRC and CPOs held on Thursday in Lokoja. The groups underscored the place of poor parenting owing to the breakdown of family values and advocated the need for parenting for peace. The groups described good parenting as the responsibilities of the father and the mother and urged parents not to cover the bad deeds of their children as love for the child. The groups urged parents to be up and doing their responsibilities, pointing out that the home is the bedrock for peace while the home was equally identified as the centre place for teaching and learning peace Earlier, the Data Entering Officer Community Peace Action Network (CIPAN), of Interfaith Mediation Council on the ongoing Community Initiative to Promote Peace (CIPP) Project, Pastor John Akor, called on the need for parents not to abdicate their responsibilities for schools and house helps. He said the need for society to come together to protect the cultural heritage for a peaceful co-existence remains relevant and stressed that poor parenting is the reason for the unsafe society the nation is faced with. He urged them to respect individual differences and culture for a peaceful society, pointing out that the time to return to old family values cannot be overemphasized.
