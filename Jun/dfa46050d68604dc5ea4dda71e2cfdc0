Chieftain of the All Progressives Congress (APC), and presidential aspirant, Chief Bola Ahmed Tinubu, has claimed that without his support, President Muhammadu Buhari would not have won the 2015 election. Speaking in Ogun State, Tinubu said, “If not me that led the war from the front, Buhari would not have emerged as the president. He contested first, second and third times, but lost. He even said on television that he won’t contest again.” “But I went to his home in Katsina, I told him you would contest and win, but you won’t joke with the matters of the Yorubas. Since he has emerged, I have not been appointed Minister. I didn’t get a contract. This time, it’s Yoruba’s turn and in Yoruba land, it’s my tenure.” -Advertisement- Tinubu appealed to the 60 delegates in Ogun to support him during the APC primary election. Recall that President Buhari has appealed to governors of the APC to assist him in picking his successor.
