Pakistan’s military says security forces killed seven militants in two different operations near the Afghan border on Sunday. Five militants were killed in raid on a hideout in the Jani Khel area of Bannu district — the gateway to North Waziristan, they said in a statement. Two other militants were killed in a shootout in a tribal district of North Waziristan. Security forces seized arms and ammunition from both areas, and said the militants had been involved in attacks on security forces in recent months. -Advertisement- North Waziristan and its surroundings were a militant sanctuary for years until a massive military operation to clear the area in 2014. Militants still show their presence by sporadically attacking forces there.
