ABUJA – The House of Representatives on Tuesday listed for approval a new retirement age for National Assembly staff, as well as their counterparts in States Houses of Assembly, to 65 years of age and 40 years of service, whichever comes first. The Bill was listed for consideration on Tuesday but later deferred to another legislative day by the Committee of the Whole presided over by the Deputy Speaker, Ahmed Idris Wase, would have been approved despite not having gone through public hearing as the Rules of the House require as an important stage of lawmaking in the Parliament. The controversial document which was quietly reintroduced in the 9th House had become invalid following the compulsory retirement of the former Clerk to the National Assembly, Mohammed Sani Omolori, who successfully had the extension of service approved by the 8th Assembly under Bukola Saraki and Yakubu Dogara as presiding officers. Sources have alleged that the renewed efforts are being spearheaded by the current Clerk, Arc. Amos Olatunde Ojo, who benefited from the ousting of his predecessor, Mohammed Sank Omolori, and who is said to be due for retirement November this year. Titled, “the Harmonized Retirement Age for Staff of Legislative Houses in Nigeria Bill, 2021,” the report which was presented by the House Majority Whip, Mohammed Their Monguno (APC, Borno) is made up of five clauses. In clause 1 dealing with application, the Bill seeks to “apply throughout the Federal Republic of Nigeria.”
