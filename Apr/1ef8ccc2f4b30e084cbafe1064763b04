He disclosed that Governor Akeredolu has approved the payment of the counterpart fund for the project as when due. The state Commissioner for Agriculture and Forestry, Mr Olayato Aribo, disclosed that the project tagged: ‘LIFE-ND’ was keyed into by Governor Oluwarotimi Akeredolu-led administration to see to the empowerment of youths and women in the state to reduce unemployment and poverty in the state.
