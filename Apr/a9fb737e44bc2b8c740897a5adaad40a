The Bayelsa State Government has announced Tuesday, April 19, 2022 as the official date for the commencement of the third term for the 2021/2022 academic session. The government has, therefore, directed all public and private primary and secondary schools in the state to resume academic activities for the term. This was contained in a statement issued on Monday evening by the Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Education, Christopher Ehwrujakpo. The Ministry explained that the date of resumption was, however, due to the peculiar terrain of Bayelsa which is prone to annual flooding and the fact that Monday was declared a public holiday for the Easter celebration. The government further stated that the third term would be concluded before the flood season would reach its peak around the state. The statement said, “Therefore, all schools are by this notice admonished to resume activities for third term on Tuesday, 19th April, 2022, immediately after the Easter Monday public holiday. “All stakeholders in the education sector are to remain vigilant and ensure strict adherence to all school safety regulations in the face of the COVID-19 and its variants as we look forward to a successful and productive third term.”
