UNUAHIA – As Nigerians gear up for the 2023 general elections, former Minister of Defence (State), Col Austin Akobundu (rtd), has said that for Nigerians to enjoy successful primaries and elections in 2023, stake­holders and members of all political parties must work towards enthroning peace in the country. Akobundu, the immedi­ate-past National Organis­ing Secretary of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), spoke on Wednesday during his meeting with stakehold­ers and leaders of the party in Umuahia North LGA of Abia State to inform them of his decision to vie for Senatorial seat of Abia Central in 2023. According to him, in order to ensure that the primaries and elections are rancour free, politicians must work for peace and unity, stressing that he, as a stalwart of PDP, started earlier to reconcile some aggrieved and warring leaders of the his party be­cause of the need to form a common front for task ahead. Akobundu stressed that he was in the Senate race to serve as a bridge builder and peace enforcer who would always stand in the gap to attract more developments to the district. He, therefore, asked the people of Umuahia North to put behind them strife and spurious rumours that might put the PDP in jeopardy in the elections, assuring them that if elected, he would carry the leaders along and ensure that they were not left out in the scheme of things. Speaking separately to the stakeholders, party leaders and delegates, the aspirant said he would continue the good work of the incumbent Senator, T.A. Orji, whom he described as a worthy repre­sentative of the people, add­ing that if elected, he would effectively and efficiently per­form the three major assign­ments of a legislator which are: representation, legisla­tion and oversight functions.
