Manchester United’s last appearance at Old Trafford saw us knocked out of the Champions League. With a lengthy spell away thanks to the international break, Ralf Rangnick’s team return for a must-win game against Leicester. While the race to finishing in the top four is now in Arsenal’s hands, United have to do all they can to put on the pressure on. Edinson Cavani is unavailable after picking up yet another injury while away with Uruguay. He’s seemingly unavailable more than he is available this season and we are struggling for options up front. De Gea, Dalot, Varane, Maguire, Shaw, McTominay, Fred, Fernandes, Pogba, ,Sancho, Elanga. Leicester: Schmeichel, Justin, Evans, Fofana, Castagne, Tielemans, Mendy, Dewsbury-Hall, Maddison, Barnes, Iheanacho.
