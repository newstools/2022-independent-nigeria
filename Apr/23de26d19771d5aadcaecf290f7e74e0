BAUCHI – A group known as the Civil Society Unity Forum has urged a former Bauchi state Commissioner, Honourable Mahiru Maiwada, to join the 2023 Bauchi South Senatorial contest under the platform of the People Democratic party or face legal action. Alhaji Abdulrahman Hamza, the Chairman of the group, while briefing journalists on Thursday at the NUJ Press Center in Bauchi said that the call became necessary because Mahiru Maiwada possessed the capability to turn around the challenges bedevilling the Bauchi South Senatorial District. ” This is not a matter of choice or interest because Honourable Mahiru Maiwada owes the people of Bauchi South Senatorial district an obligation to salvage it from it’s current dilemma and even if it entails going to court, we are ready to take such a drastic decision so as to help him to do the needful” “We have chosen Mahiru to contest for the Bauchi South Senatorial because he is our son and it is our belief that every responsible child listens and respects the interest of his people and community.We have contacted our lawyers in case the matter requires legal action because we have the right to choose who will represent us” “We are rooting for him because of his track record as a philanthropist, hard work and integrity. Honourable Maiwada has uplifted the living standard of the people of the state when he introduced empowerment programmes, scholarships for vulnerable children and the establishment of Mahez Science School in Toro Local government amongst many other achievements” he said He said that the group has already purchased a nomination form for Maiwada in order to encourage him to contest the Bauchi South Senatorial election, urging him to accept their offer.
