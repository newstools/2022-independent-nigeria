Lakers star LeBron James will miss the remainder of the season to continue healing his ankle sprain, the team announced Friday. He is expected to make a full recovery. James has not played five of the Lakers’ last six games due to the injury, suffered on March 27 in the first half of the team’s 116-108 to New Orleans. With their loss to the Suns Tuesday night in Phoenix, as well as the Spurs’ win over Nuggets, the Lakers were eliminated from 2022 playoff contention. Los Angeles entered the game in 11th place in the Western Conference, two games behind San Antonio for the last Play-In Tournament spot. James hurt his ankle by landing on the foot of Pelicans forward Jaxson Hayes. Before he hit the floor, his left ankle bent at a 90-degree angle. The 37-year-old’s ankle was wrapped after the game, and he walked with a limp. James called the injury “pretty nasty” and said it felt “horrible,” when he spoke to reporters following the loss. He was given permission to return to Los Angeles on March 30 for further treatment and evaluation on the ankle. The Lakers enter the final two games of their season on an eight-game losing streak.
