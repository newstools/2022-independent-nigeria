Canada will ban Nigerians and other foreigners from buying homes for two years as an attempt to cool off a skyrocketing real estate market. This ban would not affect foreign students, foreign workers or foreign citizens who are permanent residents of Canada. The measures will be contained in Finance Minister, Chrystia Freeland’s budget on Thursday, according to what a person familiar with the matter told Bloomberg.
