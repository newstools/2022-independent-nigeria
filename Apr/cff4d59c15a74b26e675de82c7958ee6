Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan has called for the president to dissolve parliament and hold a fresh election, minutes after the national assembly deputy speaker declined to hear a no-confidence motion against his government. In an address on state TV on Sunday, Khan said there had been unacceptable interference in Pakistan’s democratic institutions, and an interim government should be formed to hold fresh elections. “I have sent advice to the president to dissolve the assemblies… We will go to the public and hold elections and let the nation decide,” he said, referring to national and state legislatures. “When the advice reaches the president, assemblies will be dissolved which will be followed by the process of setting up a caretaker government,” he added. Khan has been facing the biggest challenge to his rule since being elected in 2018, with opponents accusing him of economic mismanagement and bungling foreign policy. No premier of Pakistan has ever completed a full term. On Sunday, parliament was due to debate a no-confidence motion on Khan, but the deputy speaker refused to accept it, causing uproar in the chamber. “I rule out this no-confidence motion in accordance with the constitution,” deputy speaker Qasim Suri, a Khan loyalist, said as the session started.
