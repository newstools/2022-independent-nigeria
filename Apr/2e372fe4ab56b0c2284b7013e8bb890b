The former Imo State Governor, Rochas Okorocha has given reasons why the All Progressives Congress (APC) should zone its presidential ticket to the South-East. The Imo West Senator disclosed this while speaking to ThisDay, stating that the APC presidential ticket should go South for the sake of equity, justice and fairness. “APC presidential ticket should go South for equity, justice and fairness and to give everyone a sense of belonging. “Secondly, even in the South, there is a need for micro-zoning like it was done in the days of Olu Falae and President Olusegun Obasanjo. They should look at the South-east and micro-zone it to the South-east to complete this long-awaited cycle for justice and peace. “Maybe after four years or after eight years, you might now say okay the cycle is completed. Now, it is an open game for all. But as long as that cycle is not completed, it might be hurting the nation from time to time because something is wrong,” Okorocha said.
