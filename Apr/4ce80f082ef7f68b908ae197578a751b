Supporters of Delta State House of Assembly Speaker, Honourable Sheriff Oborevwori, who is also a governorship aspirant ahead of the 2023 Delta Gubernatorial elections, have been asked to disregard a story credited to a popular social media blackmailer, Fejiro Oliver, that Honourable Oborevwori has been asked by Governor Ifeanyi Okowa to step down and go for House of Representatives instead. In a press statement signed by Hon. Chief Solomon Ighrakpata, Deputy Chief Whip, Delta State House of Assembly, said there was no iota of truth in the story, as their principal is very much in the governorship race. It noted that the story was sponsored by payers of the blackmailer aimed to discredit the most acceptable aspirant across the three senatorial districts. The statement read, “Many persons are already scared of the rising political profile and general acceptance of Rt Hon Sheriff Oborevwori by Deltans as the next governor of Delta State. “The only option they have left is to manufacture fake stories to misdirect the general public into accepting their unpopular aspirants. “We are not perturbed by the handiwork of mischief makers. The Sheriffication movement berths on 14th April, 2023 at Patani and Bomadi Local Government Areas. “The Sheriffication movement is more committed to the 2023 project aimed at continuing from where our respected governor, Senator. Ifeanyi Okowa will stop,” it added.
