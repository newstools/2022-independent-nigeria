The National Chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Senator Iyorcha Ayu, has taken the All Progressives Congress (APC) to the cleaner for pegging its presidential form at N100 million. Ayu, who said that pegging the price at N100 million has cast the APC in the image of hypocrites, added that the N50 million and N20 million respectively for governorship and senatorial forms shows how insensitive the ruling party is. Ayu, in a statement by his Special Adviser on Communication & Strategy, Simon Imobo-Tswam said, “Nigerians can all see what the APC is, a fragmented alliance put together to capture the power and inflict maximum pain on Nigerians, including their own members. “Nigerians will recall how in 2014, Gen. Muhammadu Buhari, now President and leader of the APC, told Nigerians that he had to borrow N27million to buy his nomination form. The same man, as leader of his party, has now sanctioned the sale of the same forms at N100m! I am told that’s an increase of N370 per cent.” Lamenting how the APC government allegedly ran the economy aground, Ayu asked “how then can impoverished APC aspirants buy nominations at such prohibitively high costs? And yet, only recently he preached ‘Equal Opportunity’ to them. “By this latest insensitive action, the APC has disenfranchised thousands of her youths, and dashed the hopes of millions of Nigerian youths, who applauded President Buhari when he signed the ‘Not Too Young To Run Bill into law in 2018.’ It is most insensitive and mind-boggling. In fact, all those buying the N100m and N50m nomination forms should be investigated for suspected fraud. “We, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), are different. We are a mass movement for the Nigerian people. This is why our nomination fees are soft and democratic. When you compare us with the APC, the difference is clear. This is why we must return to power to save Nigerians from this insensitive government.”
