Over 500 houses have been de­stroyed by rainstorms in Ise- Ek­iti and Orun- Ekiti after a heavy downpour in the two communi­ties on Thursday. Amongst the buildings af­fected are Ansar-ul-Deen Cen­tral Mosque, Ise- Ekiti and Saint Stephen’s Primary School as well as part of the palace of the traditional ruler of Orun-Ekiti, Oba Zaccheus Adewumi. Many residents were ren­dered homeless in the com­munities as shops, bakeries, viewing centres, as well as res­idential buildings, were com­pletely blown off by the storm. Saturday INDEPENDENT gathered from the locals that the heavy downpour which lasted for about one hour was accompanied by a devastating whirlwind which blew off roof­tops and also destroyed some farmlands. The Chairman, Ise -Orun Local Government, Hon Ayo Akinluyi, who led the Chair­man, Ekiti State Emergency Management Agency (SEMA), Captain Sunday Adebomi and officials of National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) on the spot assessment of the affected areas described the damage as massive. The NEMA team was led by the Director of Operations, Mr Abdulkadir Olanrewaju. Expressing sadness over the incident, the Arinjale of Ise-Eki­ti, Oba Ayodele Ajayi lamented that he had never witnessed such magnitude of disaster since he ascended the throne of his forefathers. Oba Ajayi, therefore, en­joined the disaster manage­ment officials to assist the two communities by presenting their cases to the appropriate authorities. The monarch also promised to seek assistance from some well-to-do sons and daughters of the town in providing tem­porary support for the victims. POLL “I am saddened by the level of carnage in the two commu­nities. In fact, I want to tell you that I have never witnessed such in my life. I had to personally go round to see the extent of the damage. Though, we thanked God Almighty that there was no casualty in spite of huge damage except that the victims would be subjected to another round of social pressure.”
