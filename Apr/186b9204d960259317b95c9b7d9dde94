Vice President Yemi Osinbajo, has disclosed that working side by side with the President Muhammadu Buhari has equipped him for the 2023 presidential seat. Osinbajo disclosed this on Thursday while speaking to the Oba of Benin, Ewuare II during his visit to the monarch’s palace in Edo State. The VP said, “As the Vice President, I am well equipped to lead the country due to the exposure I have working with President Muhammadu Buhari, which has exposed me to critical decisions and programmes about Nigeria. “I am here today on a political visit but for obvious reasons, I made sure I started from the palace. But I am here to consult with party members who are delegates in our forthcoming delegates’ convention. “On April 11th, I formally declared to vie for the post of the president of this country. I have been exposed to many things in government. I commend the president who has been generous to ensure that I participate in every policy of the government. I have exposure to the highest level of government and the capacity to govern the country. “I started teaching at the age of 24 and I have served in several capacities and I assure you that I will do the very best I can for the country if elected.”
