LAGOS  – The National President of the National Council of Managing Directors of Licensed Customs Agents(NCMDLCA), Lucky Eyis Amiwero, has called for a total review of the National auto policy, saying the duty rate and levy approved for motor vehicles in Finance Act of 2020 was in contravention of the NAC 15%, inputted by the Nigeria Customs Service(NCS), for import duty and levy collection. Amiwero in a letter dated April 23, 2022, addressed to His Excellency, President Mohammadu Buhari captioned, “the duty rate and levy approves for motor vehicles in finance act of 2020 in contravention of the NAC 15% levy inputted by the Nigeria Customs Service (NCS) for import duty and levy collection,” a copy of which was made available to Daily Independent, drew the attention of the Federal government to the duty and levy on Motor vehicles, approved in the Finance Act of 2020. The letter alleged that the decision of the government contravenes the National automotive council(NAC) levy of 15% assessed on Motor Vehicles by Nigeria Customs Service(NCS). Amiwero, who is the Chief Executive Officer (CEO), Eyis Resources Limited and a fellow of the Nigerian Institute of Shipping, Institute of Transport Administration (IOTA), where he once served as President, averred that the Finance Act 2020, specifically approves for Motor vehicles the following:“That the amendment of the first Schedule to the Act is amended by inserting and replacing as the case may be the following duties and levies: “Duty on Tractors(Heading 8701) From 35% to 5%, duty on motor vehicles for the transportation of more than ten persons (HS Heading 8702) from 35% to 10%; levy on motor vehicles for transportation of persons (cars) (HS Headings 8703) from 35% to 5% and duty for Motor vehicles for transportation of Goods (HS Heading 8704) from 35% to 10%”. The Finance Act, according to him, provides for 5% levy for Motor vehicles of Chapter 8703 that is cars, adding that there is no provision for NAC levy of 15% in either 2020 and 2021 Finance Act, passed by the National assembly and signed in to law. He said NAC levy was not part of the 10 year implantation plan of (NAIDP), approved by the Federal Executive Council (FEC), on the 2nd of October 2013, which is expected to expires in 2023 and never being included in the process of duty assessment and levies. Amiwero maintained in the letter to the President, that under the National Automotive Design and Development council(NADDC) Act, sub-section 1-(a), specified 2% percent as collection and not part of the Finance Act 2020 and 2021, which was referred in the circular by Nigeria Customs Service(NCS). POLL He noted that with the collapse of the auto policy in 2021 and the removal of the protective regime of duties and levies, there is the need for a total review to ascertain the possible shut fall within the 7 years of the implementation of the auto policy.
