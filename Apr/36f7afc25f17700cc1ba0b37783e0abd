A Nigerian biker, Kunle Adeyanju, is giving a different spin to charity drives as he has embarked on a jour­ney from London to Lagos on his power bike. Taking to his Twitter handle, Adeyanju announced that the ride, spanning a total distance of about 12,000km, is to raise funds for health-related projects. According to Adeyanju, the Char­ity Ride, which kicked off April 19, is expected to last 25 days and will traverse London – France – Spain – Gibraltar – Morocco – Western Sa­hara – Mauritania – St Louis – Sen­egal – Gambia – Mali – Cote d’Ivoire – Ghana – Togo – Benin – Lagos. “Day 1 of the Charity Ride in­volves riding from London to Dover, where I went on a ferry to cross the English Channel to Calais, France and then ride to Bourges, France, my stop point for the day. Total ride distance for Day 1 is to be about 745km. Pls be reminded that we have started receiving your sup­port for this noble charity cause,” he wrote. He further added that a hundred percent of funds raised will be chan­nelled to primary health, water and sanitation, PolioPlus project. “Particularly 20% of funds raised will be targeted to support the fight to sustain Africa Polio free status. Our target is N20m, pls join Hans with me and support this noble initiative massively. And per­sonally I will be giving a 10% match grant for every donation,” he added. Although biking is not so pop­ular among Nigerians, more and more people are beginning to em­brace it as a pastime.
