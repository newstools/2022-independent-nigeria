Have you noticed that for almost a year now, nothing solid or otherwise has been heard or written about this happy-go-lucky fella and Lagos big boy-cum politician, Rotimi Ajanaku? Guess you haven’t, but truth be told, this rollicking and fun-loving socialite has neither been spotted lately at either social functions or events where he used to be a dominant and recurring decimal, nor had he been noticed conspicuously for months now at major political fora in the ancient city of Ibadan, Oyo State, where he once played big and even tried to cut his political teeth as an aspirant into one of the plum seats in the National Assembly. The money bag and top socialite is not known to be out of the glee and glamour of the society scene and happenings for obvious reason of remaining relevant in the scheme of things, especially when we hear that he is still much interested in his rather veiled political ambition; his unusual silence and underground disappearance from the full glare of the public for some to be hazarding that theoncewell-endowedbusinessman and man-about-town may have quiet for some reasons. Perhaps the never-say-die Rotimi Ajanaku has strategically withdrawn into his shell to fully perfect and map out new game plan for his political onslaught as 2023 approaches. His unusual silence from the full glare is surely raising some dusts and causing anxiety among his admirers and political followers in Lagos and Oyo states. Whatever the mercantile Rotimi has in stock or in the offing will surely not take time to be exposed, because he’s a gold fish and can never hide a hiding place.
