Tax expert and Leader of the SouthWest Professionals, Chief Segun Ajibulu has declared his interest in the Ekiti North Senatorial District race ahead of the 2023 General Elections. The chieftain of the All Progressives Congress(APC) made this known through his Easter message to the people of Ekiti where he enjoined Christians to live a Christ-like life by show love to one another at all times. The pro-democracy activist predicated his ambition on the desire to serve his people through quality representation. Ajibulu disclosed that he stands a better chance of securing the ticket to the party since his Local Government, Ikole-Ekiti had not gotten the opportunity to fly the ticket. He, therefore, appealed to APC delegates to give him their votes and support him in his political journey. He said “I humbly put myself forward before you to be your able representative in the Red Chambers of the National Assembly in the forthcoming 2023 General Elections; I respectively urge our dear party delegates in the next month’s primary election, to cast their votes for me as APC candidate for the February 2023 National Assembly Election in Ekiti state. “In the spirit of Easter, it gladdens my heart and strengthens my inner spirit that we are alive to celebrate this Easter with joy, I, therefore, send my greetings. Permit me to remind you all my people that, now that it has been established that this is time for us in Ikole Local government to represent our people, Ekiti Noth at the National Assembly.”
