A woman identified as Gold Martins, has alleged that the Nigerian musician, Sister Osinachi Nwachukwu, did not died from throat cancer as stated by her family. Recall that the singer was announced dead on Friday, after being on life support for the past two months. According to Martins in a Facebook post, the Ekwueme singer died in the hands of her husband who assaulted her on several occasions. She wrote, “While praying last night, all I was praying for was for God to touch the heart of people around her. Let them come out and speak. That woman personally told someone I know what she was passing through in the hands of that her husband. According to her “if not for the church and what people will say, I would have left this marriage” “Even in their presence when that man called her, he was calling her names like “steeewpid” and “fuuuuul*ish”. If minister Osinachi could tell a total stranger her story, how much more her church? Do you want me to believe that her church and pastor didn’t know what this woman was passing through? “Can they  come out and swear that they are ignorant of the fact that she was living with her enemy?What did they do to help her? “The church has failed us. The church has failed the society. Religion has failed the society. Can we all start practicing humanity?” “God will touch more people to speak out on behalf of Osinachi. That man will not go free. Mbanu!” POLL In another post, she posted screenshots of people confirming her claims, stating that the singer’s husband caused her death.
