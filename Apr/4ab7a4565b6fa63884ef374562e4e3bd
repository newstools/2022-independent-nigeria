Karim Benzema was once again at the heart of some brilliant Real Madrid play on Wednesday. Benzema’s two first half goals gave Real Madrid the lead in their massive Champions League quarter final tie with Chelsea. Benzema once again showed why he is one of the best players in the world, with two superb headers in the space of just three first half minutes. Karim Benzema was responsible for Real Madrid’s dramatic last 16 comeback against PSG, and he was at it once again at Stamford Bridge on Wednesday night. The Frenchman is enjoying an incredible renaissance at the tail end of his career. He has stepped up to the mantle of leading the line for Los Blancos and his two goals in London had Chelsea on the ropes. Benzema’s first goal was an innovative header. After a quick Real Madrid break, Vinicius Jr – an ever-growing prospect himself – delivered a cross to the edge of the area which seemed on first glance to be approaching Benzema at an awkward height. The French striker adjusted his body brilliantly to power a header into the top corner in front of the away fans at Stamford Bridge. Chelsea looked shell shocked, and things would get worse before they got better. Just three minutes later, a similarly brilliant cross from Luka Modric met a backpedalling Benzema. Once again, the Real Madrid man met the awkward ball perfectly, as he looped a header to the far post and past Edouard Mendy. POLL When these two sides met at Stamford Bridge in last season’s semi-finals, Chelsea cruised past a poor Madrid side. It is a mark of how far the Spanish side have come since last May that they were comfortably in the ascendancy in the opening stages on Wednesday night. Central to the brilliance of Real Madrid is Karim Benzema – and there are very few players in the world in better form than the Frenchman.
