ABUJA: A Court of Appeal in Abuja presided over by Hon Justice Haruna Simon Tsamanni, on Thursday threw out an appeal against the election of the Akwa Ibom State Chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Obong Ntukekpo. A statement by Jackson Udom, Special Adviser to the Minister of Niger Delta Affairs, Senator Godswill Akpabio, said that the dismissal followed the withdrawal of the appellant (APC) from the case. Immediate past National Secretary of the party, and member of the defunct CECPC, Senator James Akpan-Udoedehe had sought a Stay of Execution of the Orders of the Court on the matter. Responding to Akpan-Udoedehe’s suit, the Akwa Ibom APC Chairman queried his capacity to maintain the Appeal having been removed from office as the National Secretary of the APC/CECPC. He argued that Udoedehe filed the Appeal on March 28, 2022 having left office on March 26, 2022; adding that the former Secretary’s name should be struck out of the Appeal for lack of locus-standi. Ntukekpo argued further that Senator Akpan-Udoedehe cannot initiate and maintain any Appeal as National Secretary of the defunct CECPC or in his personal capacity just as Comrade Adams Oshiomhole couldn’t initiate or maintain any action in the name of the National Chairman of APC.
