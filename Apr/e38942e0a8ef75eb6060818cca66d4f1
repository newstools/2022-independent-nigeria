ABUJA – The former Director-General (DG) of the National Agency for Food and Drugs Administration and Control (NAFDAC), Dr Paul Orhii, was on Thursday presented with a nomination and expression of interest form by his friends and associate to run for the governorship position in Benue. While presenting the nomination form to him at his residence in Apo Abuja, Mr Otunba Olamide on behalf of Orhii friends said, they brought the form to him because they believe he has the capacity to turn the state around. Olamide said, “This is based on his achievement while in NAFDAC and his personal life and the impact he made on a lot of people in Benue State and beyond.” He added that “The friends want him to come out and vie for the seat of number one in the state. “We know you are not going to do it for yourself, but you will do for the people of Benue. The former NAFDAC boss while receiving the forms appreciated his associate saying, “Let me thank you a lot for this trust and wonderful gesture, for me, this is not about myself but service to the people. “As you know, Benue state has a lot of potentials, especially in agriculture that the state can be as rich as Rivers state, for us agriculture is our oil and we can make more money in Benue state and good governance. “My experience in NAFDAC has prepared me to lead Benue state and take her to great heights,” he added.
