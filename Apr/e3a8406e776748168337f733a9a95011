ussia has been accused of “blackmail” after it halted gas exports to Poland and Bulgaria, signaling that the Ukraine war will impact Europe’s energy supplies. Russian energy Gazprom announced Wednesday it would stop exporting gas to Poland and Bulgaria after they refused to pay for the fuel in roubles, a demand President Vladimir Putin has made to “unfriendly” countries following his invasion of Ukraine. European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen said the move was “unjustified and unacceptable” and the EU would enact a contingency plan to find the fuel from other suppliers. The cutoff will affect deliveries of Russian gas to Poland through the Yamal-Europe pipeline and to Bulgaria via the TurkStream pipeline. Polish Deputy Foreign Minister Marcin Przdacz said his country would look to other partners, such as the U.S. and Gulf nations, to meet its gas needs. “I’m pretty sure that we will manage to handle this,” he told the BBC. Meanwhile, Poland’s climate minister, Anna Moskwa, said there would be no need to take from reserves and that a contingency plan had been in place to reduce reliance on Russian energy. “There will be no shortage of gas in Polish homes,” she said.
