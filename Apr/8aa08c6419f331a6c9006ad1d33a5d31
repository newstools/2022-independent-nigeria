LAGOS  – The Skyway Aviation Handling Company (SAHCO) Plc has enhanced its operations with the acquisition of state-of-the-art fleet of Ground Support Equipment (GSE). A statement by Vanessa Uansohia, the Manager, Corporate Communications, SAHCO, stated that the new fleet of equipment acquired included 10 passenger step units that were manufactured by Mallaghan Engineering Limited, aviation industry manufacturer, which is based in United Kingdom. The statement hinted that the passenger step units have the capacity to provide passenger access to a wide range of aircrafts, which included Boeing 747, B777, B767, Airbus 340, A380 and A320, among others. She explained further that the equipment is fitted with proximity sensors, which are devices that shut down the equipment engines when they are positioned too close to the aircraft to prevent aircraft damage. Other acquired equipment in the new fleet is an Air Starter Unit (ASU), which she said is used to supply necessary quantity of air at a specified pressure to aircrafts while it is parked. The A.S.U was acquired from Guinault in France and has an eco-friendly engine while the chassis is made from steel to reduce the rate of corrosion or wear. Also, it has a safety device attached to the fuel gauge to enable it shut down when the fuel is less than 30 litres to prevent engine damage due to fuel shortage. Furthermore, two units of Airmarrel High Loader LAM 7000 were also part of the latest acquired fleet of GSE. POLL The LAM 7000 has the capacity of loading about 7,000kg of pallets or container at a time. This equipment is also furnished with proximity sensors and were procured from Airmarrel, a G.S.E producing giant from France. It is also furnished with electrical and hand emergency pumps which can be used during emergency procedure. In a related development, SAHCO Engineering team has produced 20 baggage carts from locally sourced materials.
