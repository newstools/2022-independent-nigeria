Determined to overcome the water supply challenge and end sufferings of the residents of Madabai and Garin Maje in Nangere and Potiskum local government areas of Yobe state, a Society for the Transfer of Appropriate Sustainable Technology and Experte (TASTE) has drilled, reticulated and commissioned two solar powered and electric power boreholes in the communities. Handing over the projects, TASTE Country Director represented by the Programme Officer, Jonathan Makan explains that the aim was to better the health of the residents who depend on well water for over 200 years. “It was a need that came from the ECWA Yobe DCC in Madabai and Garin Maje communities in Yobe state. We came to help in the crisis of water faced in these communities. Our mission in these communities is to see that their challenge of water comes to an end. This well is the only source of water here and we came to better their life and health in so many ways”. “They should task themselves once the projects are handed over, the money would be used to repair the boreholes in case they break down” he said. Receiving the projects on behalf of the two communities, the Chairman of Evangelical Church Winning All (ECWA) Yobe District Church Council, Reverend Adamu Maisayo applauded Society for the Transfer of Appropriate Sustainable Technology and Experte (TASTE) for meeting the needs of the communities. Reverend Maisayo also urged the benefitting communities to take ownership of the projects so as to last long. The group TASTE had also trained 40 Water, Sanitation and Hygiene Volunteers in the communities to promote better hygiene as well fight open defecation which has become a global endemic. No doubt, the two communities of Madabai and Garin Maje located 130 and 90 kilometers away from Damaturu the state capital, providing more social amenities of this kind would end some of the outbreak of diseases which has almost become an annual incident in the areas.
