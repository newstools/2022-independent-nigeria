Barcelona travel to Basque Country tomorrow to take on Real Sociedad at the Anoeta. Both teams are separated by just five points, with Barcelona in second. Ahead of the game, Xavi has announced a list of 23 travelling players. Gerard Pique has been given the medical green light and is expected to directly slot into the starting lineup. Ronald Araujo, too, is in the list after missing out on it due to suspension on the weekend vs Cadiz. Pedri has been ruled out of the for the rest of the season and his absence was evident in the last game. His replacement, Gavi gets called up alongside Nico Gonzalez. Sergino Dest suffered an injury scare at the end of the last game when Oscar Mingueza had to be brought on his place. Luckily, it seems to have been minor as he will be making the trip to San Sebastian tomorrow. Ansu Fati and Sergi Roberto are the only other two players missing from the squad list. However, both should be on it within within the next two games.
