ABUJA – Justice Binta Nyako of the Federal High Court Abuja, on Fri­day, struck out 8 out of the 15-count charge filed by the Federal Government against the detained leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), Mazi Nnam­di Kanu. Justice Nyako freed Nnamdi Kanu on the 8 counts, namely 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13 and 14, while ruling on a preliminary objection filed by the IPOB leader challenging the validity of the 15-count amended charge preferred against him by the Federal Gov­ernment. However, the court held that Mazi Kanu has to de­fend himself on counts 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8 and 15, based on allegations levelled against him. Meanwhile, Kanu’s lead counsel, Mike Oze­khome SAN insisted that the remaining charges are baseless, watery and shaky. Ozekhome said the FG has nothing against his client, hence the repetition of counts in the charge, which he said “will fall like pack of cards because you cannot build something on nothing in law”. Also, the court heard Nnamdi Kanu’s bail appli­cation and has fixed ruling on May 18, while trial be­gins on May 26, at the Code of Conduct Tribunal com­plex Jabi, Abuja.
