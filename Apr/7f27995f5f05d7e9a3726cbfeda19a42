Toyosi, with the handle, @_misteriouss had tweeted that “I’m being kidnapped guys. I’m being raped. Number 78 Obayan street, Pako, Akoka, Lagos”. In another tweet, she later claimed it was false. She wrote, “it was false. I’m so sorry for this. Please stop calling and threatening the numbers”. However, the police have taken up the case after she voluntarily presented herself at the police station.
