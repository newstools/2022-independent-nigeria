A former Commissioner for Information and Culture in Niger State, Jonathan Vatsa, has urged the Minister of Information and Culture, Lai Mohammed, to travel round the country by road to prove his claims that Nigeria is safer under President Muhammad Buhari’s administration. The All Progressives Congress (APC), chieftain made this public challenge to the Minister while speaking to reporters in Minna, stating that it is the only way to test and prove how safe Nigeria is Vatsa said, “When you sit down in Abuja and be issuing statements just to protect your job, posterity will not forgive you. I challenge Mr Minister to tour the country by road, particularly Niger and Kaduna states let us see if the country is safer in the hand of Buhari or not. That is the only way we draw conclusions. “I wonder why President Buhari has refused to declare these gunmen, terrorists when their activities are even worst than Terrorism, especially now that they are beginning to use explosive devices, targeting national assets like the train and rail lines. “Never in the history of Nigeria had blood flowed the way it is flowing now with innocent people being slaughtered and lives cut short every day without protection. “Yet someone is there taking the people for granted with his unguarded comments that the country is safer in the midst of this bloodbath.”
