Manchester City have been handed a fresh injury blow after John Stones was forced off through injury in their Champions League semi-final first leg against Real Madrid this evening. The England international was a doubt heading into the match, though started the game against the Spanish giants at right-back. Stones’ evening came to an end just 36 minutes into the match, however, as he made way for Fernandinho. After being substituted, images emerged of the former Everton centre-back stood in the players’ tunnel with a distraught look on his face. Stones missed the Sky Blues’ 5-1 hammering of Watford at the weekend having exiting the field of play with muscle tightness in City’s prior game against Brighton. This setback comes at a back time for the Sky Blues, who are also without right-back Kyle Walker as they prepare to enter a crucial period in the season.
