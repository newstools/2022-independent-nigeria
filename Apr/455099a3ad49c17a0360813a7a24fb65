Abeokuta – The second runner up in the 2019 governorship election in Ogun State, Abiodun Akinlade, has said that Governor Dapo Abiodun of Ogun State has the right of first refusal in the All Progressives Congress (APC) ahead of the 2023 election in the state. Akinlade, who contested the APC ticket with Abiodun before joining the Allied Peoples Movement (APM) where he contested the election, said his decision to contest the 2023 election would depend on the national leadership of the party. Akinlade, who lost the election to Abiodun with less than 20,000 votes before rejoining the party, revealed that some issues were being resolved with the national leadership of the party, the outcome of which, he said, would determine if he would contest in 2023. Akinlade, who was the candidate of the then sitting Governor Ibikunle Amosun revealed this after a meeting with the leaders of the APC in Ogun West on Tuesday. “It is very clear that a sitting governor in any party has the right of first refusal, and His Excellency, Prince Dapo Abiodun, has that right in 2023. But there are salient issues being resolved presently in the party. If those issues are resolved favourably and there is opportunity for someone from Ogun West, I will contest. “But if the party chooses to return the governor regardless, there’s nothing we can do. We have to stand with the party. That’s what I came to tell our leaders today that we should pray, because this is not the time to start selling everybody out that we want to contest, no. “We need to come together as a team in Ogun West, and pray that the party will consider the merit of a petition before it. POLL If it does, then we all can come out,” he said. Asked if the followers of the former House of Representatives member would not be demoralised by his decision, Akinlade said he owed his followers truthfulness, adding that politics shouldn’t be about deceit.
