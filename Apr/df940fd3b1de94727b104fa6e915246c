LAGOS – In a bid to rid the State of environmental nuisances and achieve the mandate of Mr. Governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu towards a cleaner Lagos, the Lagos Environmental Sanitation Corps (LAGESC) embarked on a joint operation with the Governors’ Office Special Project team, Ministry of the Environment and Water Resources enforcement arm to demolish illegal structures on the Abule-Egba stretch of the Lagos-Abeokuta expressway and the Agege area of the State. This disclosure was made by the Corps Marshal of the Agency, CP Gbemisola Akinpelu at the Command Headquarters, Bolade-Oshodi. According to her, ‘‘the illegal structures which occupy the Abule-Egba axis of the Lagos-Abeokuta expressway encroach on the government’s right of way whilst the developer of a block of shops at Agege were identified and served with abatement notices but as they did not comply, our Special Squad had to demolish these structures in conjunction with the Governors’ Office Special Project team and the Ministry of the Environment and Water Resources enforcement arm’’ The Corps Marshal noted that the State Government will no longer condone the menace of car dealers, water tank sellers, shop extensions along the axis because the car dealers especially, turn the lay-bys, setbacks to car lots thereby obstructing the right of way for government projects. She affirmed that the operation will be continuous as it will be extended to the nooks and crannies of the State in a concerted bid to ensure that Lagos State is free of environmental infractions, illegal structures and that the walkways, lay-bys and setbacks are free from all forms of obstructions.
