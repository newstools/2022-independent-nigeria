The Senate President, Ahmad Lawan on Saturday advised the people of Kwara State not to allow those people that they chased out of the state’s Government House in 2019 find their way back to power. The current administration of the All Progressives Congress (APC) took over power in the state in 2019 from the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), but the PDP is scheming to recapture power in 2023. He was in Ilorin, the capital of Kwara State, to commission some of the constituency projects sponsored by Senator Ibrahim Yahaya Oloriegbe, representing Kwara Central Senatorial District. Lawan spoke at a town hall meeting organised by Senator Oloriegbe to account for his stewardship and also declare his intention to run again and represent his people of Kwara Central in 2023 polls. He told the people of Kwara State in general to continue to keep faith with APC. “I will like to remind you here, those people that you chased out will never get tired of trying to come back. You have only one more of ‘Otoge’ and they will never come back. “In 2023, just chase them far away from Kwara, and they will never find their way to Kwara. Don’t take it for granted. They are smart people. You know that. Chase them far away, if you can, up to the Atlantic Ocean if you chose to chase them to the South. If you wish, chase them up to Niger Republic. Chase them far away from here.” POLL
