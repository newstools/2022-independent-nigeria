MINN – The Niger State govern­ment has observed that since the unbundling of the Power Holding Company of Nigeria (PHCN), it has contributed towards ensur­ing that the Abuja Electric­ity Distribution Company (AEDC) survived, especial­ly by supporting them with transformers and service lines to guarantee service delivery. The state government took the step to end some of the challenges facing the AEDC and other distribution companies lacking relevant equipment and other facil­ities needed to provide elec­tricity to consumers in urban areas and rural communities across the state and other parts of the country. Secretary to the State Government (SSG), Ibrahim Ahmed Matane, disclosed this to journalists on the displeasure of the Governor Abubarkar Sani Bello-led administration over the dis­connection of his office, state secretariat and the state wa­ter board by the AEDC. As a responsive and re­sponsible government, Ma­tane, at the press conference, which took place in his office, said supporting the AEDC with facilities worth over N3 billion in the past six years is aimed at encouraging private sector businesses to thrive in the state. It is, however, worrisome that after investing such an amount of money for the procurement of transform­ers, service lines and other components of AEDC in­frastructures to ensure that electricity is connected to the various communities, the company disconnected some government facilities over alleged billions of naira debt.
