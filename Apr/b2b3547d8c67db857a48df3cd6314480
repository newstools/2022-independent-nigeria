Chief Sunny Onuesoke, a chieftain of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Delta State, has said that the dissolution of Nigeria can not be the solution to the mirage of problems confronting her now. He is however of the view that the country can be great again only if the citizens are ready to make their political and community leaders accountable for the positions being occupied. Speaking with journalists at the Murtala Muhammed International Airport (MMIA), Ikeja, the former Delta State gubernatorial aspirant advised Nigerians to also ensure that the 2023 general elections are free and fair for credible people to emerge. Responding to a question on whether the situation of things in the country will improve if Nigeria is separated as being canvassed by some people, Onuesoke declared “See, dissolution is not the solution as the same mindset will permeate no matter what nations emerge”. “The way out is a proper civic society who can hold their leaders accountable and ask that the legislature be part-time and they be paid per diem”. “The people must also ensure that elections are free and fair that way they can vote out bad leaders. Until that happens, dissolution of Nigeria will not solve any problem”, he said. The PDP chieftain, who has been critical of bad governance across the board, advised the leadership of the various political parties to ensure transparent primaries as part of efforts to throw up credible candidates that will help solve the nation’s challenges. “I am appealing to the leadership of the various political parties to be accountable to their members by ensuring transparent and inclusive primaries to avoid unnecessary loyalty that is leading us to elect unqualified persons to power,” he concluded.
