Jack Grealish has sent a message to Manchester City teammate Gabriel Jesus after his four-goal haul in their win over Watford. The Brazilian fired four past Ben Foster, helping the Blues to a 5-1 win over the Hornets as City moved four points clear of Liverpool. He opened the scoring inside four minutes, adding a second shortly after before completing his hat-trick from the spot after winning a penalty in the second half. City’s pursuit of Borussia Dortmund talisman Erling Haaland has been intensifying lately, with reports suggesting a deal could soon be in place. As a result, Jesus has been linked with a move away from the Etihad, with Arsenal among the teams said to be eyeing a deal. Jesus took his tally for the Premier League campaign up to seven on Saturday. He also managed an assist as Rodri volleyed into the far corner. Grealish started for Pep Guardiola’s side and played the full 90 minutes. He took to Instagram after the game to laud Jesus. He said: “Well done boys, great win at home! “Well done brother on a brilliant performance,” accompanied by a picture of him celebrating alongside the four-goal hero.
