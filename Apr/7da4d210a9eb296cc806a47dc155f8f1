A detailed explanatory release issued by Mrs. Joy Madaki on behalf of the management states: “RE: DON’T CRITICISE BUHARI, GOVERNMENT POLICIES ON SOCIAL MEDIA “The attention of NYSC Management has been drawn to the above caption trending on social media, purported to have been said by the Director-General. “The management wishes to state that the caption is very misleading, and at variance with the admonitions of the Director-General to 2022 Batch “A” Stream Two Corps Members during an address to them at the NYSC Ondo State Orientation Camp. “The Director-General advised the Corps Members to use the social media responsibly; in a way that will promote national unity and integration. He further counselled them to guard against the spread of fake news. “The NYSC Chief Executive never made mention of the caption alluded to him. Interestingly, the body of the report trending does not equally contain that allusion. “The management wishes to plead with reporters to avoid over-sensationalism and report things that are factual so as to avoid misrepresentation of issues.
