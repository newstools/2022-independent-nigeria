The chairman of the Association of Table Water Producers ( ATWAP) Hon.  Bamitale Oguntoyinbo has called on the supervising agencies to halt the menace of unauthorised Table Water Producers in Ekiti State. Oguntoyinbo, former Director, National  Orientation Agency (NOA) said some unscrupulous members of the society are taking advantage of the current economic hardship to produce low quality water which is dangerous for consumption at lesser prices and below what NAFDAC prescribed. Addressing members of the Association at a meeting in Oye -Ekiti, Oguntoyinbo explained that those water producers selling lesser than the national price were the factories that neglected the rules and regulations of safety agencies. He noted that many of these factories had not renewed their license for years, thereby producing Water in a substandard and unhygienic environment which made the quantity of water in the sachet. He, therefore, urged the safety agencies to embark on proper monitoring to save members of the public from consuming unhygienic water. Oguntoyinbo  however warned producers of unhygienic  water for members of the public to consume at cheap prices lesser than the national price of N200 per bag to desist from this act of sabotage The Chairman advised their customers to be wary of bad water with taste, and smell being sold at a lesser price.
