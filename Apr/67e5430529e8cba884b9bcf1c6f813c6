The leadership of the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) on Thursday said that the report of the zoning committee which recommended that the presidential ticket of the party be thrown open is subject to the decision of its National Executive Committee (NEC). Daily Independent had on Tuesday reported a news making rounds that the opposition party had jettisoned its zoning formula and set to throw its presidential ticket open to all aspirants irrespective of their geo-political zones. The party’s National Publicity Secretary, Mr Debo Ologunagba who spoke while featuring on the ‘Good Morning Show’ on ARISE News Channel noted that the NEC will meet soon to consider the report and take a position on it. Ologunagba, however, stressed that what the committee had done was to recommend, adding that no decision has been taken by the party as the report remained a mere recommendation. Speaking further, he said the PDP is sensitive while empthat the NEC of the party will consider the party and most importantly the nation while taking decisions. He said, “When it (report) is passed over to the NWC, then a date for the NEC meeting will be slated for the consideration of that report. “We are in the process of doing that. As soon as the report is delivered to the NWC, which I believe in the next couple of days – maybe in one or two days, then we can convene the meeting of the NEC for the consideration of the recommendation therein and then make a decision one way or the other. “All the recommendations made in there are subject to NEC decision.”
