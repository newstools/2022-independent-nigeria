The Premier League have announced that Chelsea’s Premier League clash against Manchester United will be rescheduled if the Blues progress to the FA Cup final. Thomas Tuchel’s side take on Crystal Palace in this weekend’s semi-final and a win would mean next month’s match against the Red Devils, which is due to take place in mid-May, will instead be moved to April 28th. The statement read: “Ahead of Sunday’s FA Cup semi-final between Chelsea and Crystal Palace, the Premier League is highlighting potential movements as a result of that fixture at Wembley Stadium. “Should Chelsea progress to the FA Cup final on Saturday 14 May, the match between Manchester United and Chelsea will move to a 19:45 kick-off time on Thursday 28 April. This match will remain live on Sky Sports. “Should Crystal Palace progress, Aston Villa v Crystal Palace will take place at 20:15 on Tuesday 3 May. Any rearrangements for matches involving Liverpool or Manchester City will be confirmed in due course.” Therefore, if Chelsea are able to defeat Patrick Vieira’s men this weekend, the match against United would be sandwiched between a home fixture against West Ham United and a trip to Goodison Park to face Blues icon Frank Lampard and his Everton side. It would also be the third year on the bounce that the west Londoners would be in the final of the FA Cup, having fallen 2-1 to Arsenal and 1-0 to Leicester City in 2020 and 2021, respectively. However, beating the Eagles will be no feat, as the Gunners found out last week when they were defeated 3-0 at Selhurst Park thanks to goals from Jean-Phillipe Mateta, Andre Ayew and Wilfried Zaha.
