Bauchi State Governor Bala Mohammed has stated that if the National Leader of the All Progressive Congress (APC), Bola Tinubu, was in the People’s Democratic Party (PDP), he would have been given him presidential ticket. The governor disclosed this in an interview on Arise TV, stating that without Tinubu, President Muhammadu Buhari wouldn’t have been the president. He said, “I was lucky I met Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu, (vice president) Osinbajo we discussed, he (Tinubu) called me consensus. “I told him (Tinubu), if you were in PDP, we would have given you the (presidential) ticket because we know that without you, Buhari wouldn’t have been the president. “In PDP, we recognise contribution. We have people in Nigeria that we must recognise and it was definitely a good outing for me.”
