Barcelona are yet to rule out a move for Tottenham Hotspur defender Sergio Reguilon with Xavi determined to sign a left-back this summer, according to a report from Mundo Deportivo. Reguilon is a player who has been linked with a move away from North London ahead of the end of the season. He has been a good performer throughout his time in the Premier League. And he clearly has the potential to be a special player in the coming years. Previous reports claimed that Real Madrid have made the 25-year-old their top target for the summer. Meanwhile, it has been suggested that his agent has offered him to Barcelona. Mundo Deportivo reports that Xavi wants a new left-back this summer. Javi Galan is their top target. But a move for Reguilon cannot be ruled out. Reguilon looks to be one of the players in the Tottenham squad with a seriously high ceiling. He has been ‘brilliant‘ at times during his spell. And he should now be coming into the peak years of his career. However, Spurs are now in a position where they could arguably accept a major offer for Reguilon. Ryan Sessegnon recently enjoyed his best run yet in the side. And Matt Doherty can fill in there. He was superb in the emphatic win at the weekend. You would also imagine that Tottenham would sign another player if Reguilon left. It would be good news if Reguilon enjoyed a long spell with the club. But he has not been flawless. And if he was keen to leave for Barcelona, Tottenham should not really fear the idea of losing him.
