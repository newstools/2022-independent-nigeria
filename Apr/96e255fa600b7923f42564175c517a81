Along with the big game against Villarreal, the start of the week for Bayern Munich has been dominated by the future of Robert Lewandowski. According to multiple reports in Europe, Lewandowski is open to moving to Barcelona in the summer transfer window. The German media has confirmed Barcelona’s interest in the Polish forward, but they have denied claims suggesting that the striker has already asked Die Roten to grant a transfer. Going by the latest update from transfer expert Gianluca Di Marzio, Barcelona will find it very difficult to sign Lewandowski in the summer. According to Di Marzio, Bayern will look to get a fee close to €70-80 million for Lewandowski if they decide to part ways. He also reported that Barcelona is looking to pay not more than €30 million for the 33-year-old striker since he will enter the final year of his current deal in Bavaria. If Die Roten manages to get that fee, then it will be a club-record fee they will receive for a player’s departure. Lewandowski has been reportedly waiting for the contract talks to begin since the start of the season. Despite persistent assurances from the club hierarchy, there has been deliberation from Die Roten to begin negotiations. The lack of contract talks has strengthened Pini Zahavi’s case for finding a new club for Lewandowski. Previously, Bayern has stood firm when the Polish striker wanted a transfer in 2018. The German club refused to hear offers for him, and he eventually ended up signing a new deal. Lewandowski managed to enjoy the best three years of his career since the last contract renewal. He kept on improving his scoring rate, and Die Roten managed to win a treble. Since Robert Lewandowski is still scoring at an incredible rate, it will be a huge shock to see Die Roten ready to negotiate a departure for him. However, the Polish striker’s age may force the club to think about cashing in for him during the upcoming summer transfer window.
