No fewer than 228 business owners have benefited from the N4.5 million loan, courtesy of the National Directorate of Employment (NDE) in Bauchi State. The state Coordinator, Mr Lawan Yaya who stated this during the disbursement of the loans to the beneficiaries in the state said that the programme was carried out under the Micro Enterprises Enhancement Scheme (MEES) of the directorate. Yaya stated that the programme was an initiative of the Director-General of NDE, Malam Abubakar Fikpo, which was aimed at boosting micro-businesses with more emphasis on women. “Each beneficiary would be given the sum of N20, 000, adding that payment would be done directly to their bank accounts. Some of the beneficiaries will include sellers of masa, zobo drinks, fruits, beans cake (Akara), cap washers, among others” “The beneficiaries were selected across the 20 Local Government Areas of the state and the loan has a moratorium period of three months in which thereafter, they would start repayment for three years,” he said. He urged the beneficiaries to make effective use of the loan to achieve its aim of enhancing their businesses. Hajiya Amina Ibrahim, one of the beneficiaries who spoke on behalf of others, promised to channel the loan toward the purpose it was meant for.
