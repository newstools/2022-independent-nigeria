The Zamfara State government  has dethroned two emirs and a district head over allegations of aiding the activities of bandits terrorising communities in the state. The affected monarchs are the Emir of Zurmi, Abubakar Atiku, and Emir of Dansadau, Hussaini Umar. Alhaji Sulaiman Ibrahim, the District Head of Birnin Tsaba, was also affected. The dethronement was revealed to journalists by the state Commissioner of Information, Alhaji Ibrahim Magaji Dosara, immediately after the Council meeting. The Council upheld the recommendation of a six-man white paper committee set up by the state government to review the report of two separate committees earlier set up to investigate the involvement of the three traditional rulers in the activities of banditry in the state. The three deposed monarchs were earlier suspended by the state government following wide allegations of serious involvement in the activities of bandits in the state. The findings of the committees also revealed abuse of Land Act in their domain and the government ordered the reversal to status quo involving the lands illegally allocated. According to the commissioner, the government has also ordered that all land titles issued by the affected traditional leaders be revoked. “The State Executive Council has also directed the state Ministry of Justice to issue an executive order to back up the council resolution,” he added. POLL The deposition of the traditional leaders comes 10 months after they were suspended by the state government.
