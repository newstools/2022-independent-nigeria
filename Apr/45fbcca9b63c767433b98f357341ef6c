Chief Whip of the Senate, Dr. Orji Uzor Kalu, has expressed shock at the number of pres­idential aspirants from the South West and South South geopolitical zones when equity and justice demand they should be supporting the South East for the presidency. He said the right thing to do, as political parties are on the verge of picking their can­didates, is for the governing All Progressives Congress (APC) and the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) to zone their pres­idential tickets to the South East, which remains the only zone in the South that has not produced the president and vice president since 1999. In a statement entitled, “2023 Presidency: The Fairness I Know,” Kalu said although he wants to contest for the presi­dency, he would not do so except if the APC zones the ticket to South East. According to him, in the absence of zoning to the South East, he would seek reelection to the Senate, as “the reality is that the North is more advan­tageous to win elections in this democratic setting.” Expressing disappointment that people from South West and South South are jostling for the presidency, after their zones had produced Presidents and Vice Presidents, Kalu said it was “embarrassing that these aspirants (APC and PDP) have no single respect and con­cern for the South East. I had thought they would think about the South East; I thought they would support us.” The former governor said if there was anything like fairness, equity and justice, “it should be the entire South push­ing for a president of South East extraction. Anything less than that is ‘hypocritical, unjus­tifiable and inordinate.”
