Russia’s decision to stop supplying natural gas to Poland and Bulgaria is a further test of European Union unity in support of Ukraine, which continues to resist President Vladimir Putin’s invasion after 64 days of fighting. The decision of Gazprom—Russia’s state-owned energy giant—to freeze supply to the two EU and NATO nations, both of whose energy networks depend heavily on Russian imports, was condemned as “blackmail” in Brussels. Putin is long accused of weaponizing Russia’s energy exports. This freeze has been interpreted as a threat to all of Europe that Moscow is willing to turn off the taps and choke Western economies, even at great cost to its own revenue. But with EU nations rapidly turning away from Russian energy and mulling sanctions on Moscow’s oil exports, Putin’s gamble might also galvanize the West’s economic siege. In the Baltic states—which have traditionally called for a tougher line on Russian aggression—some believe Putin’s gas gambit will accelerate the EU’s gradual phasing out of Russian natural gas. One Latvian diplomatic official, who did not wish to be named, told Newsweek that the gas freeze could “absolutely” undermine Russia’s strategic position. “It is also a nice greeting to our German friends, I think,” the diplomat said, referring to Berlin’s opposition to energy sanctions on Moscow.
