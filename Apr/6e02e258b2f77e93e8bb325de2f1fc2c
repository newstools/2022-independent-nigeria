Following the news making rounds that Vice-President Yemi Osinbajo will on Thursday formally declare his intention to run for the 2023 presidential election, sources close to the VP have debunked the news, saying he will not declare for the presidential race. It could be recalled that Osinbajo’s spokesperson, Akande Lalolu had in February reported that his principal has not decided on contesting the presidency in 2023. “The VP continues focusing all his attention on the work of this administration and on supporting Mr President in every possible way. Please continue to ignore the speculations,” Akande had said. But on Tuesday, April, 4, some news reports had claimed Osinbajo will formally declare to contest in the next election under the platform of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC). Reacting to the news development, sources close to Osinbajo’s camp, the vice-president has not made any plan to declare for the 2023 presidency on the said date as reported by some media platforms. The Vice President has been called on by groups in the country to run for the presidency in the 2023 general elections, but Osinbajo has left Nigerians in suspense as to whether he would be joining the presidential race or not. This is despite his posters and other campaign materials appearing on different streets in the country. Meanwhile, the Vice President’s former boss and chieftain of the APC, Bola Ahmed Tinubu, has since declared to run for the presidency come 2023 and has continued his consultations in earnest. There are notions in some quarters that Osinbajo will not be among those that will battle APC’s ticket with Tinubu.
