In what could serve as a major blow for Xavi and his troops, Barcelona have confirmed the injury of Pedri, with the midfielder sustaining a rupture in his left biceps femoris during the UEFA Europa League quarter-final clash against Eintracht Frankfurt. The club had earlier confirmed that Pedri was taken off at half-time due to a hamstring discomfort. He was replaced by Frenkie de Jong during the second half, even though Barcelona went on to lose 3-2 at Camp Nou, eventually crashing out of the competition. In an official statement, Barcelona have confirmed Pedri has completed his diagnosis. His recovery will determine his availability, but many, including news outlet Què T’hi Jugues, fear the youngster may miss the remainder of the campaign due to the hamstring issue. It could be a significant loss for Xavi, who has been unlucky with injuries throughout his tenure at Camp Nou so far. Pedri’s injury comes at a crucial juncture of the campaign when Barcelona are embroiled in a tense top-four race in La Liga. WIth 60 points, the Catalans are the firm favourites to secure Champions League football next season, but with Sevilla, Atletico Madrid, Real Betis and Real Sociedad breathing down their necks, Pedri’s services could have been useful. However, it is not all doom and gloom for Xavi, who was boosted by the return of Sergino Dest, Gerard Pique and Memphis Depay prior to the Frankfurt game. While Pique couldn’t appear on Thursday, he is likely in contention to feature in the upcoming league encounter against Cadiz. POLL Even young attacking Ansu Fati is closing in on his return to full fitness after recovering from a thigh injury. Although the game against Cadiz might come a bit too soon for the youngster, he is in contention to feature against Rayo Vallecano in the next matchday.
