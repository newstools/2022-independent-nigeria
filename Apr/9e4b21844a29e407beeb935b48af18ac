Mr. Godwin Obaseki, Governor, Edo State has enjoined Christians across the country to emulate the virtues of tolerance, love and selflessness as espoused by Jesus Christ in commemoration of Good Friday. Obaseki gave the charge in a message to mark Good Friday, a Christian holiday in preparation for the Easter celebration. The governor noted, “As the Christian faithful celebrate the sacrifice of Jesus Christ on Calvary, I urge everyone to take this opportunity to reflect on the significance of this day which embodies Christ’s love for mankind by imbibing the virtues of love, tolerance and selflessness. “It is only when we are able to tolerate and accommodate others; love one another irrespective of religious, political, ethnic, or ideological differences, and live selflessly as Jesus Christ did by sacrificing his life on the cross, that we will be able to tackle the many challenges facing us as a country and people.” Obaseki noted, “As we celebrate Good Friday, I urge all to be our brother’s keeper, uphold the spirit of togetherness and remain resolute on our love for God and our nation.”
