The People’s Democratic Party (PDP) candidate in the 2021 governorship election in Anambra State, Valentine Chineto Ozigbo has been persuaded to run for the Anambra South Senatorial seat. Ozigbo, an immensely popular candidate came under pressure at the weekend when people in his political blocs in the state called on him to run for the position. Ozigbo who confirmed his acceptance in a zoom meeting with journalists said that he has accepted the call by his “people, the people of Anambra South, and influential voices across Anambra State” to run for the seat. It will be recalled that Ozigbo’s first foray into politics was in 2020 when he made history by clinching the gubernatorial ticket of the PDP in a keenly contested primary in June 2021 and came second in the gubernatorial election behind Prof. Chukwuma Soludo of the ruling All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA). Having cut his teeth in politics the clamour for him to run for the senatorial seat of Anambra South began with youth groups and political blocs in the state pushing for him to serve at the Red Chamber. Ozigbo resigned from his role as President and Group CEO of Transcorp Plc in 2020 to dedicate the next chapter of his life to public service. He is the Founder of the non-profit charity, Valentine Chineto Ozigbo (VCO) Foundation, through which he has positively impacted the lives of thousands of people in Anambra State
