Jurgen Klopp has confirmed Roberto Firmino remains sidelined for Liverpool but the Reds could welcome back Kostas Tsimikas for Saturday’s trip to Newcastle United. The Brazilian hasn’t featured for Liverpool since coming on as a late substitute in their FA Cup semi-final victory over Man City, having missed their three victories over Manchester United, Everton and Villarreal with a foot injury. And yet to return to training, Klopp admitted the forward has been absent for longer than the Reds had anticipated. “ Bobby, it’s not a serious injury,” he told reporters. “We are still all kind of convinced but it takes now a little bit longer already than we all thought. Especially Bobby thought as well. “He will not be ready for tomorrow, he didn’t train yet. We have to get further information and find a way to get him back.” However, Liverpool could welcome back Tsimikas – and potentially Jones – after missing the Champions League semi-final first leg through illness. However, the Greek is more likely to be available having already returned to training. “We had a little bit, and I hope it didn’t actually extend bigger, we had a little problem with Curtis and Kostas,” Klopp explained. “Kostas was back yesterday, Curtis couldn’t train yesterday still. This is why these two boys were out.”
