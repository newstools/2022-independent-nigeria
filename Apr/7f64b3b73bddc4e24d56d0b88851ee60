LAGOS – In its own contribution to fight and eradicate malar­ia in the society, the Ikeja Golden Lions Club, through its monthly activities, has shifted the battle ground to Oregun community in Ikeja, Lagos. The club’s April pro­gramme was targeted at the people of the commu­nity, where mostly the preg­nant women, market wom­en, and adults benefited from the sensitisation on eradicating malaria in the environment. Lion Esther Benson, the past President of the club, said that malaria is one of the real causes of a lot of deaths in Africa and Nigeria in particular, and for that, the club is trying to eradicate it through its monthly programmes. “So we are trying to sen­sitise the people of Oregun to clean their areas, sur­roundings, ensure there is no stagnant water. We are giving out treated mosqui­to nets and teach them how to use it every night, espe­cially the pregnant women because if they are infect­ed with malaria, it would affect their unborn baby,” Lion Benson said. In same vein, Lion Jumoke Adejoke Adebajo, Chairperson of April 2022 project, urged the pregnant women and market women at the event to follow up on signs and symptoms of ma­laria. She said, “Any pregnant woman that is sick of ma­laria should go straight to the health facility close to her house.” Oba Olusesan Olukunmi Akingbola, Oba of Oregun, expressed his appreciation to the club for carrying out Roll Back Malaria pro­gramme in his domain.
