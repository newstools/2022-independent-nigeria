LAGOS – In line with the mandate of Mr. Governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu towards ensuring a cleaner environment in Lagos State, the Lagos Environmental Sanitation Corps (LAGESC) popularly known as KAI has admonished Lagosians to maintain a tidy environment and to continue obeying the Environmental laws. Bolade-Oshodi, the Corps Marshal of the Agency, CP Gbemisola Akinpelu (retd), while speaking at the Command Headquarters, said: “It is essential for Lagosians to keep their surroundings clean warning that those still constituting environmental infractions in the State would be dealt with in accordance with the law”. The Corps Marshal warned street traders, hawkers who are in the habit of displaying their wares for sale on the pedestrian bridges, gutters, road setbacks, lay-bys, medians, verges to desist from the act as it contravenes the State Environmental Management Protection Law of Lagos State 2017 and impedes free vehicular and pedestrian movement. She further harped on the need for pedestrians to resort to the use of strategically-erected pedestrian bridges on highways in Lagos State in order not to be knocked down by overspeeding motorists (hit and run) as they must be concerned about their safety in order not to put their lives at risk. Stressing on the menace of ‘Okada’ riders, both private, commercial, dispatch and uniformed men plying the wheelchair ramps of pedestrian bridges in Lagos to cross to the opposite lanes on the expressway, CP Akinpelu (retd) maintained that the law would take its due course on the rider and the bike as the ramps are meant for People Living With Disabilities (PLWD). The Corps Marshal bemoaned the recurrent acts of residential areas in Lagos State to channel their waste into the gutters, refusing to empty their overflowing septic tanks among other environmental infraction as the Agency keeps receiving numerous petitions and actions are currently being undertaken to deal with these elements. She encouraged Lagosians to be security-conscious during the Easter break whilst maintaining a clean, hygienic and habitable environment around their residential areas to stem the spread of diseases.
