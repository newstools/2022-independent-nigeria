POLL In the area of National Security, he said that the command attached so much importance to the national security, adding that officers and men of his command carefully conducted physical examination of cargo to ensure that all importations are done in strict compliance with extant laws, “especially in the area of compliance with regulatory requirements for controlled items and enforcement of import prohibition laws.” Speaking on the inter-agency collaboration and stakeholders’ engagement, the Customs boss said: “It is on record that a very robust relationship exists among the various government agencies operating in the command. “These are agencies like the Nigeria Police, NDLEA, NAFDAC, SON, NESREA. “We have effectively functioned as the lead agency towards ease of doing business in the port. “This has greatly contributed to the efficiency in service delivery.” He said the command had continued to maintain a cordial relationship with the various stakeholders like importers, exporters, licensed customs agents, freight forwarders and others. “Regular meetings were held with our critical stakeholders where issues affecting various segments of the supply chain were well discussed and solutions proffered. The forum served as a platform through which compliance was being preached and feedback received. “Through these engagements, we were able to operate in an atmosphere that was conducive for trade and accomplishment of our service goals.” Speaking on measures put in place to ensure that arms and ammunition are not illegally imported into the country through his command even as we approach 2023 being year of election, the Customs boss said: “On what we are doing to ensure weapons do not come into the country through our port, the way we operate here, we are always at alert, our officers are thorough. The way we conduct our examinations, it is 100% physical examination. When people import vehicles in containers, we examine the containers and examine what are contained therein in the vehicles. Through that, we have been able to come across one or two things that are of interest, which have been adequately forwarded to the appropriate authorities. Knowing that we are going into election next year, what we need to do is to introduce measures, make sure we conduct more intensive examinations to forestall such illicit importation, where we come across them. “I assure you that we are equal to the task, we have been doing it and we will continue to do it. I don’t think we have any fear as a command whether we will be able to handle it. We will definitely handle it. “We have officers; we have men on the ground that will do the job. Again, we have encouragement, we have the support of the Service, so we have no reason not to do it. At this our level, we are aware that we have no other country.”
