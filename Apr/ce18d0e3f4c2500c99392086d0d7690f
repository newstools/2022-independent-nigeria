Political analyst and commentator on national issues, Comrade Godwin Offor has described the pro-Goodluck Jonathan protesters as political jobbers, who just want to ride on his back for their selfish interests. This came shortly after a group of people were said to have stormed the office of the former president Goodluck Ebele Jonathan urging him to contest the 2023 presidential election describing him as the only one who could return the country to her past glory. Comrade Offor noted that these people were only out to lure Jonathan into the contest in order to make money out of him and bring his name to disrepute. He then advised Goodluck to turn deaf ears to their request which lack sincerity and instead remain the peace maker and bridge builder that he has been. It will be recalled that as the 2023 general elections timetable released by Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) continue to count in days, there has been a good number of Nigerians declaring interest for the number one position and groups canvassing for their preferred candidates all with various slogans.
