This disclosure was made on Monday at the Lanjorin Street office of the Nigerian Labour Congress, NLC, office, Ilorin where it held a familiarisation meeting with national and state officers present. Speaking on this, chairman of the party, James Dada, said that SDP has come to stay in Kwara. “Kwara State is one of the State where SDP found its footing with massive members. ” It is absolutely necessary to state it here without mincing words that some well to do individuals were pleased with the manifestos of the party and agreed to work with us on the same track,” he said. According to the party chieftain, SDP has its membership across the sixteen local govt areas in the state. Explaining the basis of the meeting on Monday, Dada said that there was a need for old and new members to familiarise themselves with one another. He explained that apart from aggrieved APC members, members from PDP have also signified intention to be part of the SDP movement. POLL “It is in this light that today’s gathering signposts the fact that Social Democratic Party has arrived and by the grace of God will rule the state come 2023,” he said. Recently, a major faction of the APC loyal to Minister of Information, Lai Mohammed, defected to SDP in Ilorin.
