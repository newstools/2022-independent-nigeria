BENIN – Mr Christopher Ojo, an aspirant for the House of Representatives seat has condemned the high cost placed on the expression of interest and nomination forms by political parties ahead of the 2023 general elections. Ojo who stated this in a chat with newsmen in Benin on Thursday said the exorbitant cost of forms negates the essence of the “Not Too Young To Run Act.” He noted that many youths who are willing and ready to participate in the forthcoming elections have been discouraged by the development. According to him, “If not indirectly telling us to wait for more time or perhaps, be involved in the corrupt act, where do they expect us (youths) to get this huge amount of money from to buy just form. “From what I have seen so far, there is no party that sells forms below N3 million, forgetting that much more money will be spent in campaigns and other logistics. “Tell me, how many of us can really afford this cost and yet, they preached to us about inclusive participation. “I may be wrong, but then, I feel this is just a deliberate means of discouraging youths’ participation in politics in this part of the world. Ojo who is an aspirant of the All Progressives Congress (APC) for Owan Federal Constituency however appealed to the political parties that have already fixed their prices for the forms to reconsider by reducing the cost. POLL “If the plan for inclusiveness is real and we want to make true the essence of “Not Too Young To Run Act” then the political parties just as a matter of urgency see to the need to address this issue. “They should reduce the cost outrightly for every interested persons irrespective of age or they provide some incentive because I don’t see how many interested youths can afford a million naira as we speak.”
