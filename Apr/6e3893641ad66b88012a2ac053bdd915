The African Private Equity and Venture Capital Association (AVCA), has announced the release of its 2021 Annual African Private Capital Activity report. The anticipated annual report is a concerted effort to provide deep insight into private capital fundraising, investments and exits in Africa throughout 2021, data and analysis across investment strategies covering venture capital, private equity, infrastructure, private debt and real estate activity on the continent between 2016 and 2021. The findings share a comprehensive view of case studies on investments and exits on the continent in 2021, and the distribution and value of deals across sectors, and regions, covering West, Southern, East, North, and Central Africa. The last two years have transformed livelihoods, travel, and trade within and beyond the continent. Moreover, the COVID-19 pandemic continues to move market activities across diverse industries, influencing progress and economic growth in an ever-changing world. The pandemic highlighted enduring inequalities and the imperative to invest in physical, digital, and social infrastructure. Businesses faced unprecedented challenges during the pandemic. This is not, however, a reflection of the continent’s evolving investment climate and track record of growth, given that Africa’s economies are leading as a region of resilience with vast potential. POLL According to the IMF’s Regional Economic Outlook report, real GDP in Sub-Saharan Africa grew by 3.7 per cent in 2021 and is projected to increase to 3.8 per cent in 2022. According to AVCA’s 2021 Annual African Private Capital Activity Report, the total value of private capital deals reported in Africa reached a record high of $7.4 billion, representing a 118 per cent increase compared to $3.4 billion registered in 2020 – surpassing the annual average deal value of $4 billion between 2016 and 2020 (+85%). This signifies the gradual maturation of private investment in Africa, which rose at 13 per cent (CAGR 2016-2021). Further, the findings are a testament to the success and visionary work of firms whose pioneering missions encourage the growth of African economies through digital transformation, innovation with finance, climate-smart agriculture – and attract local and global investments. The report emphasises that in 2021, the total volume of private capital deals reported in Africa was 429, a 66 per cent increase compared to 258 deals recorded in 2020 – exceeding the annual average deal volume of 215, experienced between 2016 and 2020 (+100%).
