BENIN – In a bid to ensure food se­curity in the country, the National Directorate of Employment (NDE) has embarked on the training of unemployed persons on sustainable agricultural development who will be resettled with loans after the training. This is aimed by the directorate to improve its statutory mandate as training and empower­ing organ of the Federal government, while the trained beneficiaries will be empowered with soft loans. Abubakar Fikpo, the Di­rector-General of the Na­tional Directorate of Em­ployment (NDE) disclosed this while flagging off the training of no fewer than 100 unemployed persons in Edo State. The Director-General, who was represented by the Edo State Coordina­tor of NDE, Mr. Solomon Edobor said the director­ate is expected to train 100 unemployed persons on sustainable agricultural development and resettle 168 others with loans on completion of the train­ing. According to him, the directorate has assigned the Rural Employment Promotion Department to implement the sustainable agricultural development training scheme (SADTS) and the graduate agri­cultural empowerment scheme (GAES) across the country. “These schemes have over the years recorded huge success through rural economic growth, reduction of urban-rural migration, employment opportunities for grad­uates of a tertiary insti­tution, wealth creation among others,” he said. He noted that the SADES and GAES will target graduates of ter­tiary institutions who have a strong passion for agriculture, while local farmers are not exempted and as such will receive soft loans of N100,000 to enable them to start their own businesses.
