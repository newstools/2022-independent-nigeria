This happened in my ward; Umuchu ward 2 and I was happily received by my ward chairman and the entire party faithful in my ward. I noticed that I missed my home party so much. Mr. Speaker, I have also tendered an unreserved and unalloyed apology to my party in the ward where I said that there is no justification for my leaving the party whatsoever. Mr. Speaker, I also tendered the same apology to my local government Aguata, state, national and diaspora. I wish to thank the leader of our party His Excellency Prof. Chukwuma Soludo the Executive Governor of Anambra state and my brother.
