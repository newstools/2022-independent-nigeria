ABUJA – Group under the auspices of Equal Right And Value Gender Advocacy Forum has said that a call by Nollywood actress, Georgina Onuoha, for the revocation of Pastor Paul Enenche of Dunamis International Gospel Centre and his wife, Becky, after the death of gospel singer, Osinachi Nwachukwu, has been described as preposterous and begotten from pure bitterness. The group in a statement by its National Coordinator, Mr. Johnson Obiora, a copy of which was made available to newsmen in Abuja on Tuesday described Onuoha’s statement as misplaced priority, not genuine, unpatriotic and baseless, adding that recent issue on ground had nothing to do with medical licence of the Dunamis pastor and his wife, saying that both Dr. Enenche and his wife are qualified medical practitioners in Nigeria, legally registered to practise medicine in Nigeria and the Nigerian Medical Council has a constitution, explicit provisions of what disqualifies a medical doctor in the Federal Republic of Nigeria and if need be, not by a mere call of a Nollywood actress. The group said, revocation of licences can only be contemplated when the practitioner is unable to carry out his duties as enshrined in the 1999 Constitution on the ground misconduct, unprofessionalism, insanity or ill health. The statement reads, “It is regrettable and despicable that despite these clear provisions of the constitution, some persons lurking under the cloak of quasi celebrity personal and looking for cheap popularity chooses to amplify calls for revocation of licences of a medical doctors turned great man and woman of God.
