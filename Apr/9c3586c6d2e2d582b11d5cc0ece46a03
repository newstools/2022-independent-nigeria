Rayo Vallecano travel to Camp Nou on Sunday night to try and take crucial points in their fight for survival. What would previously have been termed ‘the impossible’ is a real possibility these days. As proved by Cadiz just six days ago and themselves, back in October. Los Franjirojos beat Barcelona 1-0 in the return fixture at Vallecas, with a goal from Falcao. Eventually it would end up being Ronald Koeman’s final game as Barcelona coach. The good news for Rayo manager Andoni Iraola is that he might be able to call on the goalscorer from that famous victory, Radamel Falcao. The Colombian has been absent with injury for their last seven matches, but was in the squad for Rayo’s victory at Espanyol last weekend, even if he didn’t get on the pitch. According to Maite Martin of Diario AS, everything points to the idea that Falcao will see some minutes against Barcelona this evening. El Tigre’s absence has been felt of late, with Rayo struggling for goals in recent months.
