ABUJA – Vice President Yemi Osinbajo has declared his intentions to run for the presidency in 2023. He did so a few minutes ago after a consultative meeting with some governors elected under the All Progressive Congress last night at the Presidential Villa Abuja. His declaration comes after several months of speculations about whether he would run for the presidency or not. He said, “for the past seven (7) years, I have served as Vice President under a true Nigerian patriot, President Muhammadu Buhari. “In these 7 years, while on the train of duty and service, I traversed every part of our country, meeting Nigerians of every cadre, class, tribe and walk of life, both young and old; I MET YOU. “I’ve stood where you stand and sat where you sit. I know and I understand our hopes, aspirations and fears from a place of relatable proximity; and I believe that in those hopes and aspirations are the seeds for the great Nigeria that we all desire. “I believe that the very reason why the Almighty God gave me these experiences, these insights, and these opportunities, is that they must be put to the use of our country and its great peoples. “This is why today, with utmost humility, I formally declare my intention to run for the office of the President, Federal Republic of Nigeria, on the platform of our great party, the All Progressives Congress. POLL “I also most solemnly and respectfully seek your support as fellow Nigerians everywhere in this land and the diaspora, as we embark on this great and exciting journey that lies ahead of us. It is time”.
