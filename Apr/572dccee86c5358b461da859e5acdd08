Nigerians have taken to their respective social media platform to react following the comment made by the National Leader of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Asiwaju Bola Tinubu that youths tweets on WhatsApp. Tinubu, who is also a presidential aspirant in the 2023 general elections while addressing youths of the party at a rally held in Lagos at the weekend said social media users could tweet on WhatsApp. He said, “Do you know how many of you are tweeting on WhatsApp right now? [intelligible] holds a database of 1.6 billion on WhatsApp alone.” Tinubu made the controversial comment while decrying how Nigeria has not been able to harness its full potential in the area of modern technology, promising to fix it if elected president in 2023. The former Governor of Lagos State failed to correct himself and specify that WhatsApp is a messaging platform owned by Meta and its estimated users stood at two billion as of the end of 2021. On the other hand, Twitter is a microblogging platform used by politicians, journalists, businesses, and everyday citizens to comment on emerging issues and causes. Reacting to his comment, some imminent Nigerians took to their Twitter handles to knock the former governor, wondering if he could not distinguish between the two dominant platforms, how could he fix such a problem. @renoomokri said, “According to Tinubu, “Many of you are tweeting on WhatsApp”. And he wants to be your President? This is Buhari part 2!” POLL Tweeting via @RealSolaKuti, one Babasola Kuti Junior said, “Mc Oluomo’s president said you people are tweeting on WhatsApp. Then he goes on to say we started disconnecting phone numbers for NIPP (National Independent Power Project) instead of NIN. Jagaban come dey make Buhari be like person wey get PhD from Oxford.” @Imudia_se wrote, “Tinubu has already given us a sign again… Tweeting on WhatsApp. Previous: Permanent voter cards have an expiry date. To recruit 50million youths to fight unemployment… If someone you know starts saying abnormal speeches, what would be your advice?” @OmoGbajaBiamila said, “So, did the sign language guy also interpret the “tweeting on WhatsApp…”? ” @Royaltyuso said, “Your wannabe President said that you Nigerians are “tweeting on WhatsApp”. Guess who?” @ManLikeIcey said, “Did I just hear Tinubu say tweeting on WhatsApp ???? Nigerian youths won’t be fooled ” @theonly1acre wrote, “I will leave Twitter soon. I want to focus on tweeting on WhatsApp. It’s about time..” @isexcel: “Pantami disconnected phone numbers from the national electricity grid: TinubuThe youth are tweeting on WhatsApp: Tinubu. Two blunders under 48hours. There is no way you want to package this man….no way. He does have the mental strength.” @OparaNweze: “I just heard a presidential aspirant say that WE ARE TWEETING on WHATSAPP, and OUR PHONE NUMBERS WERE DISCONNECTED FROM NIPP… May affliction not rise a second time…Amen!!!” @Obong_Ekpe: Nigerian Youth’s like Tweeting on WhatsApp too much.  Deluded old drug Baron.” Tinubu’s mixture of both platforms marks another instance of his embarrassing public statements. The 70-year-old politician said last year that the Nigerian military should recruit 50 million youths to fight unemployment, a statement his handlers later walked back. He also said the Permanent Voter Cards have an expiry date, contrary to public knowledge and the position of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC).
