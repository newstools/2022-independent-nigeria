In a bid to strengthen the cultural and bilateral relationship between Nigeria and the Republic of The Gambia, Otunba Segun Runsewe, the Director-General, National Council for Arts and Culture (NCAC), has declared his intention to launch the Nigeria/Gambian friendship club. Runsewe made this known in his office when he played host to a delegation from the Gambian Radio and Television Services who were in his office as part of their working visit to Nigeria. Otunba Runsewe who expressed delight over their visit to the council said he has tremendous respect for the people of Gambia for their unwavering efforts in sustaining their good cultural heritage. According to Runsewe, the good relationship between Nigeria and Gambia was visible when both countries collaborated effectively during their participation in some International tourism events when he headed the Nigerian Tourism Development Corporation (NTDC), adding that the Gambian Embassy was the first to pay him a courtesy visit when he assumed duty as the Director-General of NCAC. “The best way to promote any nation is through its brand identity. If Gambia develops a strong brand identity, it will be easy to market the brand,” Runsewe said. Earlier in his address, Mr. Malik Gyang, the Director-General, Gambian Radio and Television Services and the head of the delegation said they were on a working visit to the Nigerian Television Authority (NTA) with a view to exploring areas of mutual partnership, experience sharing and networking.
