AWKA  – The Anambra State House of Assembly Committee Chairman on Agriculture and lawmaker representing Awka North state constitu­ency, Hon. John Nwokoye, has outlined several reasons he left the All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA) to join the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). Nwokoye, who officially announced his defection to PDP during plenary, recalled that all his efforts in the build­ing of APGA in Awka-North seemed to be in futility as he accused past APGA govern­ments of not attending to the infrastructural needs of Aw­ka-North local government area. The lawmaker said, “l left APGA simply because it failed to advise the former governor to do the needful in Awka-North to develop it infrastructure wise and oth­erwise. To spend Awka-North local government funds in Awka-North. That is the only reason I left APGA to join PDP. “APGA is a movement and I love it, but it failed to advise the past administration on the need to spend the mon­ey meant for Awka-North in Awka-North. I moved it as a motion.” Nwokoye said his decision to join PDP was not intended to make the Prof. Charles Chukwuma Soludo-led APGA government ungov­ernable, but he said he would partner with the government to achieve a liveable and pros­perous Anambra State.
