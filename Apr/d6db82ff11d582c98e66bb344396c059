Iraqi Foreign Minister Fuad Hussein announced on Sunday that his country will host the fifth round of talks between Saudi Arabia and Iran. The fourth round had ended some eight months ago and no date was set for when they would resume. Hussein described the talks at the time as positive. Baghdad had hosted all the rounds of talks. The FM had stressed that his country was exerting all of its efforts to ensure their success. It was using all its relations to create opportunities for understanding between the two sides. Iran’s Nournews reported a positive atmosphere permeated the talks, increasing hopes for “steps on the path of resumption of ties” between the two nations. The Nournews and the Mehr news agency said the “constructive” dialogue from the last round may lead to a meeting between the Saudi and Iranian foreign ministers.
