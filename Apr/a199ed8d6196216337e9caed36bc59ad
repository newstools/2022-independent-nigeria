ussian President Vladimir Putin has accepted an invitation to take part in a G20 summit later this year in Indonesia, Indonesian President Joko Widodo, the current G20 chair, said on Friday. Speaking from the Bogor Presidential Palace in West Java, the Indonesian leader said his Russian counterpart told him personally that he would attend the G20 summit in Bali this fall. The news comes weeks after U.S. President Joe Biden said Russia should be removed from the G20 over Putin’s decision to invade Ukraine on February 24.Biden and Putin could meet for the first time in person at the meeting since the beginning of the Russo-Ukraine war, if the Russian leader does attend. Indonesia currently holds the rotating Group of 20 presidency. Widodo said he had talked over the phone with Putin, who “provided an update on the situation in Ukraine including the ongoing negotiation process between Russia and Ukraine.” “Putin expressed his gratitude for the invitation to the G20 summit and he said he would attend,” Widodo said. An official with Indonesia’s Foreign Ministry, Triansyah Djani, confirmed last month that Indonesia would “remain impartial” and invite all G20 members to the summit, as per established procedures. “Our position is quite clear,” Djani said. “We have always based our diplomacy on principles.”
