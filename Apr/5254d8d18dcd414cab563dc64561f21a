Speak Out 24/7, a pro-de­mocracy non-governmental organisation, has described as unguided and inciting, a statement from the Muslim Rights Concern (MURIC), that called for a Muslim to succeed Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu in 2023. In a well-circulated and widely reported statement en­titled, “Lagos 2023: Don’t rob Peter to pay Paul,” MURIC Di­rector, Professor Ishaq Akin­tola, expressed the view that Christians have had their two terms and so, it is the turn of Muslims to produce next gov­ernor by 2023 to succeed the sitting Governor, Sanwo-Olu. According to a statement signed by Adekunle Adeosun on behalf of Speak Out 24/7, such a statement is not ex­pected from a respected cler­ic and university don at this point in time when all hands are expected to be on deck for religious tolerance and peaceful co-existence among the residents of the state. The NGO, floated to advo­cate for good governance and democracy sustenance, said: “It is high time our religious lead­ers, academic gurus and com­munity heads worked towards the unity, progress and develop­ment of the society,” wonder­ing, “how people of high calibre like Professor Akintola could be engaging in an exercise that could be viewed as divisive and intolerant.”
