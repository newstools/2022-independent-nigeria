JUSTUS ADEJUMOH WITH AGENCY REPORT A global summit to chart an end to the COVID-19 crisis and plan for future upheavals will occur May 12, 22 the White House has said. The virtual gathering will be co-chaired by the United States, along with current G7 president Germany, G20 president Indonesia, African Union chair Senegal, and Belize, the current chair of the CARICOM Caribbean grouping. “The summit will redouble our collective efforts to end the acute phase of the COVID-19 pandemic and prepare for future health threats,” This will be the second global huddle on the pandemic, which has killed more than six million people and triggered profound disruption to leading economies and trading patterns in the two years since it began to spread. Biden hosted a similar summit last September, at which he urged partners to surge vaccines and ensure that 70% of every country has been vaccinated by September this year. Although death rates are plummeting worldwide, the virus continues to spread, preventing many leading countries from fully lifting restrictions, while Shanghai in China is in the midst of a draconian lockdown. “In advance of the May 12, 2022 summit, we are calling on world leaders, members of civil society, non-governmental organizations, philanthropists, and the private sector to make new commitments and bring solutions to vaccinate the world, save lives now, and build better health security — for everyone, everywhere,” the joint statement said. POLL “The emergence and spread of new variants, like Omicron, have reinforced the need for a strategy aimed at controlling COVID-19 worldwide,” it said. And while the latest variants are less lethal, the summit statement stressed there must be a focus on stopping similar future catastrophes from taking the world by surprise.
