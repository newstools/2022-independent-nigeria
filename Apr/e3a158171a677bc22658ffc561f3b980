LAGOS – Imama Amapakabo, the coach of Abia Warriors, has blamed hard luck for their draw with visiting Niger Tornadoes in one of week 23 games of the 2021/22 Nigeria Professional Football League (NPFL) season decided at the Okigwe Town­ship Stadium on Saturday. In a match in which the vis­itors saw red, Abia Warriors failed to hold onto their league and had to settle for a 1-1 draw at the end of hostilities. Paul Samson put the home side ahead in the 35th minute but they (home side) came un­der attacked thereafter from the visitors who threw more men upfront looking for the equalizer. The result remained thus at the break but on resumption, Tornadoes chased for a goal even as the home team also pushed to consolidate on their lead. However, in the 50th min­ute, Augustine Njoku of Abia Warriors scored into his own net to gift the visitors the most-sought-after equalizer. Subse­quent efforts by either of the sides proved abortive as the result stood. Despite a red card to Gabri­el Wassa of Tornadoes in the 85th minute, the Ochendo Boys could not find a way behind their defence for the winning goal.
