Media personality, Ifedayo Olarinde, popularly known as Daddy Freeze, has urged Nollywood actor, Yul Edochie, to unite his polygamous home first before asking Nigerians to support his presidential ambition. Recall that the actor in an Instagram post on Saturday pleaded with Nigerians to help him buy the nomination form and support his ambition to the next President of Nigeria in 2023. However, Daddy Freeze via his Instagram page, describe the actor’s plea as an audacious move after breaking his first wife, May Edochie’s heart. The OAP wrote, “My dear brother, unite your polygamous home first before coming to ask for public groom price. “Which one is ‘buy form for me’, seriously? After annoying a whole nation? After what you did to your wife of sixteen years we should now trust you? “I have nothing against polygamy, its just the audacity for me, combined with what I believe to be betrayal.”
