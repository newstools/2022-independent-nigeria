Veteran Nollywood actress, Hilda Dokubo, has revealed why she decided to keep her maiden name and not bear her husband’s name. According to the actress, she made a vow to her late father who she had a close relationship, never to keep her maiden name for life and never change it for any reason. Dokubo disclosed this while speaking to media personality, Chude Jideonwo, in a video that was posted on Thursday via his YouTube channel. She said, “My father, may his gentle soul rest, and I had a kind of relationship that I had promised that I was going to keep my maiden name for life, whether I got married or didn’t get married. I was going to keep that name. “So the bargain with whoever was going to take me as a wife was also that ‘Dokubo’ will be there. Now, the reason is very simple. I am the first daughter on average, I can choose not to and tradition gives me the right not to but if I choose to, I was going to maintain my last name. “I got properly married, three levels. Traditional, court and church.”
