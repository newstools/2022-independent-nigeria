The Ricketts family have announced they will not lodge a final bid to buy Chelsea, leaving three bidders left. The American family, who own Major League Baseball team Chicago Cubs, have been among the parties most interested in purchasing the Premier League outfit. Roman Abramovich announced his intention to sell as he became embroiled in Russia’s war in Ukraine. The Ricketts family had enjoyed success as owners of a sports team and excelled in redeveloping the stadium at which the Cubs play at. A Stamford Bridge redevlopment has been discussed which furthered their case, however previous emails surfaced showing views which caused plenty of issues with the Blues’ fans. Islamophobic emails from Joe Ricketts, the 80-year-old head of the family, surfaced and led to protests from the Chelsea fans. The Chelsea Supporters’ Trust had insisted any new owner had to support inclusion and diversity and it became clear the divide was an issue. A statement from the prospective owners, published today, reads: “The Ricketts-Griffin-Gilbert Group has decided, after careful consideration, not to submit a final bid for Chelsea F.C. In the process of finalising their proposal, it became increasingly clear that certain issues could not be addressed given the unusual dynamics around the sales process. We have great admiration for Chelsea and its fans, and we wish the new owners well.” Joe’s son Tom, who was driving the Chelsea bid had insisted that his father was not involved in the deal, but they still opted to withdraw from the process. Fans have been using the hashtag #NoToRicketts on Twitter prior to the family pulling out.
