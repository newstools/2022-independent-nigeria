The Civil Society Organizations (CSOs) under the aegis of the CSOs Coordinating Center (CCC), have expelled the Convener, Adopt A Goal Initiative, Dare Ariyo-Atoye; Coordinator, Human Rights Writers Association of Nigeria, Emmanuel Onwubiko; and the National Coordinator, Advocate for People’s Rights and Justice, Giwa Victor. The reason for expelling them, according to the group, was their attack on the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) Governor, Godwin Emefiele. The Centre’s Director, Mallam Abubakar Mohammed, in a statement on Tuesday in Abuja, said that they were motivated “to smear Emefiele and expel them from activities of the CSOs Coordinating Center, which is an apex platform for all CSOs involved in public advocacy and ban them from attending any event that the CCC is part of for one year until they apologise for the smear attacks. According to the statement, Mohammed said we hope they will retrace their steps.” Mohammed further raised alarm over plans by some desperate politicians to continue to sponsor some CSOs to embark on ceaseless campaigns of calumny against their perceived opponents ahead of the 2023 general elections. He said: “Part of the strategy is to enlist some unsuspecting sections of the media into a plot to continue to blackmail and ridicule their opponents by whipping some sentiments against them.” Mohammed noted that one of such perceived opponents, who have been marked by desperate politicians with the aim of pulling him down in the media is Emefiele. Mohammed said: “We, members of the CSOs Coordinating Centre, also expressed our confidence in Dr Emefiele’s leadership of the apex bank and  positive achievements being recorded under his watch.”
