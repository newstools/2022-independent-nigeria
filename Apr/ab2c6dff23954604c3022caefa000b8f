Archbishop Emeritus of the Methodist Church Nigeria, Ayo Ladigbolu, has declared that the next Alaafin of Oyo will inherit the wives of the late Oba Lamidi Adeyemi. Ladigbolu stated this while speaking in an interview with The Punch, expressing that it is customary for forthright new Alaafin to be responsible for their welfare because they are married to the institution and not just a person (Oba Adeyemi). He said, “The new king will inherit them and that is the tradition, but you know things are changing now. “Once a woman is married to the Alaafin they are married forever to the Alaafin. You know circumstances of life are changing and we have to adjust to the changing trends. “They are married to Alaafin and Alaafin is not a person but an institution. The new Alaafin will be responsible for their welfare because they are married to the institution and not just a person.” When asked if the wives of the late monarch can be allowed to leave the palace or remarry, the Archbishop said, “I don’t have to elaborate on that; all I can say is that they are married to Alaafin and Alaafin is not a person but an institution. “That is why the question of who they belong to after the death of the Kabiyesi who married them did not arise. They belong to the Alaafin. But in the light of the prevailing circumstances we will have to adjust. That is my response.”
