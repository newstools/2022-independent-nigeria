Candidate of the leading po­litical party in Ekiti State, the Social Democratic Party (SDP), Chief Segun Oni, has appointed Mr. Moses Jolayemi, a seasoned journalist and ma­jor stakeholder in the party, as spokesman of the campaign and chairman, Segun Oni Media Committee (SOMEC). A statement signed by Oni and made available to jour­nalists, said Jolayemi would henceforth direct the affairs of the media team, both inter­nal and external, with a view to reengineering the entire communication architecture as the campaign enters the next crucial stage. A team of seasoned journalists grounded in various aspects of com­munication had also been inaugurated. In the discharge of their duties, Oni told the new chair­man to ensure that his mem­bers adhere to developmental journalism and ensure that their public communications are purely issue based. Oni also cautioned the team to avoid the use of abu­sive language associated with the two other parties.
