The National Oil Spill Detection and Response Agency (NOSDRA), on Thursday, confirmed another alleged attack on the Ogboinbiri/OB-OB gas pipeline operated by the Nigerian Agip Oil Company (NAOC) in Bayelsa State. NOSDRA’s Director-General, Idris Musa, said the breach of the facility occurred on Wednesday and resulted in a fire incident around the Okaka and Azikoro communities in the Yenagoa Local Government Area of the state. The vandalism had disrupted the oil firm’s gas export feed to the Nigeria Liquefied Natural Gas (NLNG) gathering and processing plant. Musa said the recent attack took place barely one week after the gas pipeline was vandalised on March 29. The agency had a day after the incident claimed its investigation revealed a rising spate of sabotage-induced oil and gas leaks at oilfields in Bayelsa. Musa claimed that three sabotage-related incidents had occurred on oil and gas facilities in the state within one week and advised operators to reinforce surveillance. He explained that few days after the ruptured point on the gas pipeline was clamped, vandals allegedly blew up the facility and it went up in flames. The NOSDRA boss said, “There was a gas leak last week from a vandalised OB-OB/Ogboinbiri gas pipeline at Okaka in Bayelsa State. POLL “The pipeline was repaired but unfortunately re-vandalised again, resulting in a fire. The NAOC is working actively to de-pressurize the pipeline in order to effect repairs on the pipeline.” Officials of the oil company declined comments on the incident and negligence of the regulator’s admonition to intensify surveillance on the facility when contacted. The fire incident, which has impacted the environment, had not been put out as of the time of filing this report.
