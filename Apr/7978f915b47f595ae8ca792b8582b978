Lagos – With four points from available12 since the start of the second stanza of the 2021/2022 NPFL season, Rangers International F.C have their works cut out as they storm Kaduna with a resolve to annex all available points and do a double over resurgent, Niger Tornadoes F.C at their adopted home ground, Ahmadu Bello Stadium, Kaduna. After the pulsating draw at home to Sunshine Stars, a result that impacts not too well on the team’s set targets for the season, the ‘Flying Antelopes’ will have to dig very deep into its reserve to come up with a five-star performance to keep up the chase on the duo of Rivers United and Plateau United in this mid-week fixture. In the reverse fixture in Nnewi in a matchday 4 fixture, the ‘Ikon Allah’ Boys were clinically demolished by 4-0 and coach Maikaba still has all the ‘Foot Soldiers’ that helped him achieve that feat and will likely be unleashing the ‘Victory Hungry’ players on the coach Bala Mohammed tutored side. The duo of Elijah Ani and Ossy Martins will likely lead the attack that will come up against the defense line of the host expected to be led by the duo of Sunday Akinmoladun and Bolaji Adeyemo just as the visitor’s defense, most likely to be anchored by Uche John and David Chimezie should be wary of a certain pint-sized, dribbling wizkid, Ahmadu Liman, Segun Alebiosu and Emmanuel Jonas. Ten points separate both teams as the visitors occupy the third position on the log on 38 points with the host placed 13th with 28 points and have been on a high since the start of the second stanza with two wins, one draw, and a loss and will be looking to do an act of revenge on the visiting ‘Flying Antelopes’. Recall that the last two visits of the Enugu side to the Ahmadu Bello Stadium, saw the ‘Flying Antelopes’ run away with a 1-0 victory over now relegated Jigawa Golden Stars and a 1-1 draw against the ‘Sai Masu Gida’, Kano Pillars in the 2020/2021 NPFL season. Coach Abdul Maikaba who landed Kaduna with members of his squad, Monday afternoon, said, ahead of the fixture, “Like I have said in most sessions with the media, no two matches are the same. We may have lost some vital points since the start of the second round but we are prepared to cover lost ground and I am positive of getting a good result in the fixture against Niger Tornadoes. POLL They started the second round on a high and that is a positive for them and we are not letting that fact slip.”
