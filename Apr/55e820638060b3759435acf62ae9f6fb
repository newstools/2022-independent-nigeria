Tension in the Edo State chapter of the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) escalated after a pressure group within the party called Rescue Mission Forum called for the immediate resignation of the state Chairman of the party, Tony Aziegbemi. In a press conference simultaneously conducted across selected states and Edo,  the group accused the chairman of working with the Edo state governor, Godwin Obaseki, to circumvent the constitution of the Party. In a statement signed by Hon. Anthony Lawani, the Edo State branch chairman of the forum,  the group arrived at this conclusion after holding a national virtual meeting with members across the globe where the decision was reached to call for the suspension, removal or resignation of the former lawmaker. Lawani in a release sent to the press asserted that the decision was in the best interest of the PDP not only in Edo but also across the country. “We have resolved that we must come to the rescue of the Party at this critical moment in Edo State. “We have valid reports, even from some of the governor’s closest aides, who confessed to us that if the governor is not allowed to take over the structure of the Party, he will ensure that he causes implosion in the Party and see that nobody flies the Party’s flag in the 2023 general elections. “We are already aware of the grand design by the governor in collaboration with the chairman, Tony Aziegbemi, to write the names of their preferred candidates for the LGA election, and send them to the Edo state independent electoral commission and install them as chairmen and councillors in the 18 LGAs. “But I can assure you that we are equal to the task as we are ready to challenge every illegality perpetrated by the governor and Aziegbemi.” POLL The Group also assured members of the party in the state to remain steadfast and uphold the sanctity of the Party’s constitution and be informed that they have already written the BOT, as well as the NWC of the Party.
