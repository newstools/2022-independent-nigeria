Australia is sending more weapons to Ukraine as the country continues the battle against Russia which entered Day 63 today. Prime Minister Scott Morrison and Defence Minister Peter Dutton made the announcement in a statement. Ukraine will get six M777 lightweight towed howitzers and ammunition in the package worth 26.7 million Australian dollars. Australia’s total military assistance since the start of the war has now reached 225 million dollars. There’s another 65 million dollars provided for humanitarian aid and over 70,000 tonnes of thermal coal. The statement said the equipment offers further support to combat Russia’s “brutal, unrelenting and illegal invasion” of Ukraine. The Australian government vowed to continue to identify opportunities for additional assistance to boost the capability of the Ukraine Armed Forces. “Australia stands with the people of Ukraine and again calls on Russia to cease its unprovoked, unjust and illegal invasion of Ukraine”, the government noted. POLL On Tuesday, Australia and about 40 other nations attended a meeting on the war at the U.S. Ramstein Air Base in Germany.
