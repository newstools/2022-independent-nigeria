Nigerian Afrobeats singer, Seun Anikulapo-Kuti, has stated that the African culture doesn’t encourage violence against women and children. He disclosed this on Thursday via his Instagram page, expressing that it is the European culture that supports ‘Spare the rod and spoil the child’, ‘A woman’s place is in the kitchen’. The singer wrote, “There is no part of African culture that encourages violence against women and children. ‘Spare the rod and spoil the child’, ‘A woman’s place is in the kitchen’, are European Abrahamic proverbs. What is the African version? “You aren’t African except in location! You don’t practice anything African except the small language you speak! Your holy land is Jerusalem and Mecca! Your most valuable possessions are your European thoughts and things! “But as soon as you want to break your equally European wife and child, you claim African.”
