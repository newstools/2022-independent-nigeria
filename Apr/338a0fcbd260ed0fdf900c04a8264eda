The Israeli coalition government lost its razor-thin parliamentary majority after a lawmaker from the governing right-wing Yamina party unexpectedly quit on Wednesday. Idit Silman, the chairwoman of the alliance, announced she was withdrawing her support for the coalition and would instead work to form a new government. The move comes as a blow to prime minister Naftali Bennett and his government, which was sworn in in June last year to put an end to a political deadlock that had gripped Israel for two years. Silman’s resignation leaves Bennett’s eight-faction coalition with 60 seats in the 120-seat parliament. Meanwhile, former Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu, now the leader of the opposition, is expected to try to topple the coalition government and gather support to form a new one, according to local media. The longest-serving premier congratulated Silam on her decision, calling it “brave.” He went on to urge other right-wing deputies to “join Idit and return home to us,” stressing they will be “received with all due respect and with open arms.” According to media reports, Silman could join Netanyahu’s Likud party as she was promised the position of health minister in a future government.
