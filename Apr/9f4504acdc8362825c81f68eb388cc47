Tottenham defender Matt Doherty will miss the end of the season after rupturing his medial collateral ligament (MCL) during Saturday’s win over Aston Villa. Doherty was able to walk off the pitch in the first half after a tackle from Matty Cash but the 30-year-old is set to miss 12 weeks with the knee injury.
