The upcoming summer transfer window could see a lot of demand for strikers amongst top European clubs. Bayern Munich may also have to dip in the market for a number nine if Robert Lewandowski decides to leave Bavaria. The Polish striker’s agent, Pini Zahavi, is set to meet the club hierarchy this week to talk about the renewal. However, reports in Spain have suggested that Barcelona is ready to move ahead with their plans to sign Lewandowski. The prolific striker is also open to a move to La Liga, so Die Roten face a difficult round of negotiations with Pini Zahavi. In the possibility of departure, Rekordmeister will have to be prepared to find the right replacement. They have already been heavily linked with a move for Ajax’s Sebastian Haller. Along with Haller, Rekordmeister will be linked with numerous other strikers. According to AZ (via iMiaSanMia), Bayern also has Real Madrid forward Luka Jovic on the list of targets for the number nine position. The Serbian striker is expected to leave the Spanish club in the summer as he has struggled for form in La Liga. Despite a poor spell of two years at Real Madrid, Jovic has time on his side. The 24-year-old forward will be soon entering the prime of his career. A move away from the Spanish capital can help him to get back to his best. Bayern will consider Jovic as a long-term solution for the number nine role. Similar to Haller, Jovic also has the experience of playing in the Bundesliga. Both of them had a very productive spell at Eintracht Frankfurt few years ago. Having the experience of playing in the Bundesliga will make sure that the adaptation period is smaller for them if they move to Bavaria. Despite exploring options in the market, Bayern will be hoping that they will convince Lewandowski to sign a new deal. They may have to make an exception for the striker and sanction a longer deal to convince him to stay in Bavaria. The German club has often given shorter deals to players that are above the age of 30.
