Candidate of the Social Democratic Party (SDP) in the June 18, 2022 Ekiti State governorship election, Chief Segun Oni, at the weekend, called for the immediate reinstatement of sacked workers of the Ekiti State University (EKSU) by Governor Kayode Fayemi administration in 2019. Recall that the management of the EKSU had on December 5, 2019, disengaged over 900 of its workforce for alleged certificate forgery, irregular appointment, and overage among other sundry allegations. The disengaged EKSU staff, who subsequently, sued the university authorities at the National Industrial Court (NIC) in Akure, obtained a judgment nullifying their sack, which the government has refused to obey. Afterward, some of the workers approached the Appeal Court sitting in Ado Ekiti which again ordered the reinstatement of the workers. In his ruling, Justice Tunde Awotoye, also gave the university management a 30-day ultimatum to pay the reinstated workers their salaries, emoluments, and allowances from the date of their unlawful disengagement. The court also directed the university to pay the workers the three months’ salary they were l owed before the unlawful disengagement. Speaking on the development through his Director of Media and Publicity, Segun Oni Campaign Organisation, Jackson Adebayo, Oni noted that prides itself as democratic ought to be guided by the rule of law and not disobey judgments of any law court. The SDP candidate wondered why the workers have been subjected to untold hardship with their families left to bear the consequence of the government’s unjust action.
