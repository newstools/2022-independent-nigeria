Gareth Bale could start for Real Madrid in the side’s Champions League quarter-final clash against Chelsea at Stamford Bridge tonight. The Welshman has made just five appearances for the La Liga giants this season and his agent confirmed earlier this week that he will finally leave the club at the end of the season, when his contract expires at the Bernabeu. The 32-year-old’s career at the club has been blighted with by his strained relationship with supporters and local media, despite his decorated nine years in the Spanish capital. But Bale didn’t feature against Celta Vigo on the weekend, with the Sun claiming that he was rested ahead of his return to England. Bale was sensational in Wales’ 2-1 win against Austria in the international break, where he scored twice in Cardiff. It’s claimed the winger could now start at Stamford Bridge, in what could be his final appearance in England. Bale is rumoured to be preparing to retire after the World Cup in December and he’s likely to sign a short-term deal with a club this summer to maintain his fitness for the competition, should Wales make it. Carlo Ancelotti has jetted into London after testing negative for Covid-19. POLL The Italian had looked set to miss the fixture against his former side but he was cleared to travel after returning a negative result. Chelsea are the favourites to progress to the semi-finals, despite Real’s miraculous win against Paris Saint-Germain in the last round.
