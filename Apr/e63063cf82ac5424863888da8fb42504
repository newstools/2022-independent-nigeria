Real Madrid are all set for their Champions League clash with Chelsea on Wednesday night. Los Blancos made the trip to London on Monday ahead of their quarter-final first leg clash with Thomas Tuchel’s men. Real Madrid face a difficult test as they look to bag a semi-final spot, facing last season’s winners and the team that beat them in last season’s semi-finals. Much has changed since then, with Carlo Ancelotti‘s men impressing in La Liga, getting themselves into a commanding position. It’s set up to be an intriguing battle over two legs, and ahead of the first of those outings, Real Madrid have completed their final session, which took place at Stamford Bridge itself. And there were only three absentees for the session, with Eden Hazard being one of those. The former Chelsea star underwent an operation earlier this week to remove a plaque put in during a previous procedure. Aside from Hazard, only Isco Alarcon and Luka Jovic are absent, both through injury. POLL All the remaining players who can be selected were present and fit for the session
