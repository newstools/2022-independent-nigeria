KANO – All Progressives Congress (APC) Zonal Youth Leader (North-West), Abdulhamid Umar Mohamed on Thursday appealed to the National Chairman of the party, Alhaji Abdullahi Adamu, to grant 50% discount on intent form for youth seeking to contest for elective positions under the platform of the party. A strongly worded letter by the Zonal APC stalwarts copied obtained by DAILY INDEPENDENT said such a gesture would encourage youth participation in governance. Umar Mohammed explained that “as youth leaders in the party scheme of things, is this debilitating factor to achieve the wisdom behind not-too-young-to-run Act in 2019 signed into law by President Muhammadu Buhari.” He stressed that “Youth across the length and breadth of the country who form more than 50% of the voting population, membership of our party and the general population are facing the threat of exclusion from the governance process due to non-availability of Finances”. The Youth leader, therefore, canvassed “for a special discount of at least 50% for all youth seeking to contest for elective positions under the platform of our great party,” adding that “a number of other political parties are already doing this for their young members.” Mr Mohammed noted that the youth represent “the most active, the most volatile, and yet the most vulnerable segment of the nation’s population”, as he suggested the need for support available to enable them to realize their full potential. He noted that the support would give the youth wing of the party a great sense of belonging in the party, adding that it would further entrench the reputation of APC as the most youth-friendly party in Nigeria. According to the two-page letter: “Young people as defined by the national youth policy are characterized by energy, enthusiasm, ambition, creativity, and promise; they are also faced with high levels of socio-economic uncertainty and volatility thereby becoming the most vulnerable segment of the population.” POLL Umar Mohammed stated that as the nation marches steadily towards 2023 general elections, “it is expedient on us to kindly bring to your attention our Chairman Sir, on the major concern of the generality of the youth wing of our great party.”
