UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has again called for a cease-fire in Ukraine and warned of the impact of Russia’s war against its neighbor is having on food security around the world. “We are extremely interested in finding ways in order to create the conditions for effective dialogue, create the conditions for a cease-fire as soon as possible, create the conditions for a peaceful solution,” Guterres said in comments as he began a meeting with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov in Moscow on April 26. Lavrov said the two would discuss “the situation around Ukraine that acts as a catalyst for a great number of problems which had piled up over recent decades in the Euro-Atlantic region.” Guterres will later meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin before he travels to Kyiv to meet with Ukrainian leaders.
