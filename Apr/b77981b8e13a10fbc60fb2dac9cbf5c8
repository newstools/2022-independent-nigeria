ABUJA – A human rights activist, Deji Adeyanju, has faulted the decision by the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) to peg its Presidential nomination form at N100 millionahead of the 2023 general elections. The party had pegged its nomination forms at N100m for the president, Senate at N20 million and governorship forms at N50 million. He condemned the cost of the forms describing it as outrageous that would further encourage looting and corruption among the public officers. Adeyanju disclosed this on Wednesday while reacting to the announcement by the party at the end of its National Executive Committee (NEC) meeting held at the Transcorp Hilton in Abuja. He accused the party of subjecting Nigerians to untold hardship and pains over their failure to fulfil their 2015 electioneering campaign. He said: “APC fees for Nomination Forms are outrageous and will encourage corruption is unreasonable to charge, “Senate – N20M; Governorship – N50M; Presidential – N100M. “This means everyone is going to loot and not to serve. Where’s the 2015 CHANGE that was promised.”
