LAGOS – The Airline Operators of Nigeria (AON) has condemned the recent attack of staff of Max Air by some unruly passengers. The umbrella body of the airlines also kicked against the destruction of the airline’s property due to a flight delay. AON said the unfortunate development further heightened their deepest concern and worry over the increasingly deplorable state of security and the rising threat to the lives of airline staff and their property at Nigerian airports. In a statement signed by Alhaji Abdulmunaf Yunusa, its President, the AON stated that the airport vicinity was a sensitive and sacrosanct environment where people were not allowed to behave in callous and uncontrollable manner. The body observed that a situation where passengers were allowed to have access to sensitive restricted areas of the airport and attack airline staff or prevent a plane from departing to other destinations because a particular flight was delayed or cancelled put the country in a bad light in the international community.
