Former Provost of the Federal College of Education, Special, Oyo, and former Minister of Sports and Special Duties, Prof Taoheed Adedoja has commiserated with the people of Oyo over the recent death of the Alaafin of Oyo, His Imperial Majesty Oba Lamidi Adeyemi III. Prof Adedoja, in his condolence remark, said, “the progress and development experience at the Federal College of Education, Special, Oyo while I was the Provost and Chief Executive Officer of the Institution from 1996 to the year 2002  can be attributed to the atmosphere of peace and communal relationship with the institution which was possible with the benevolent disposition of the late Monarch, notable of which was the establishment of the Federal College of Education Special, Oyo in 1977 and the eventual movement of the College to its present permanent site in Akinmorin, Oyo. “Ever since my tenure in that capacity at the helms of affairs at the Institution, I have developed a very cordial relationship with Kabiyesi, Alaafin of Oyo and the good people of Oyo Kingdom. His fatherly roles will be greatly missed moreso as a great custodian of rich Yoruba historical, cultural and traditional values”. The former Minister of Sports and Special Duties prayed to the Almighty Allah to grant the late monarch Aljannatul Firdaus.
