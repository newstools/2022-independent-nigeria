Abuja – The Supreme Court on Tuesday nullified the participation of Senator Andy Uba as the candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in the last governorship election in Anambra State. A five-member panel of the apex court held in a judgment that the APC breached its own guidelines for the conduct of primaries and thus, failed to conduct valid primary from which Uba emerged as the party’s candidate in the Anambra governorship election. Consequently, the panel had to affirm the February 23, 2022, judgment of the Court of Appeal, which upheld the December 20, 2021 judgment by Justice Inyang Ekwo of the Federal High Court, Abuja. The Supreme Court proceeded to dismiss the appeals filed by Andy Uba and the APC – marked: SC/CV/240/2022 and SC/ CV/241/2022. In the December 20, 2021 judgment, Justice Ekwo had among others, held that Uba was never a candidate in the election conducted on November 6, 2021, having emerged from an illegally conducted primary election held by the APC. The court declared that all votes recorded in favour of the APC and its purported candidate by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) are waste and should be expunged from the record of the electoral body on account of being unlawful votes. Justice Ekwo stated that the plaintiff in the case marked FHC/ABJ/ CS/648/201, Chief George Moghalu, a governorship aspirant on the platform of the APC, had succeeded in proving that the APC did not conduct a valid primary election from which Uba claimed to have emerged as the party’s candidate. Also, the court ordered that the names of APC and Andy Uba be expunged from INEC record on the ground that their purported participation was unknown to the country’s electoral laws. POLL In addition, Justice Ekwo ordered that the sum of N25 million collected from the plaintiff in the suit be returned to Moghalu by the APC due to failure to conduct primary election for all qualified governorship aspirants who paid the mandatory amount but denied fair treatment.
