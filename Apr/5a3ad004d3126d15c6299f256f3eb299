Leading player in the country’s estate industry and aspirant for the Delta South senatorial seat at the 2023 General Elections, Dr Sylvester Onoyona, has said that his aspiration to represent his people at the Senate from 2023 enjoys massive support and appeal from the zone, the state and across the country. He said this while giving details of his last consultation campaign in Delta South over the weekend to Daily Independent. According to him, the aim of the campaign was to take to the grassroots, consultation on his aspiration. “We also spoke to leaders, party leaders across the eight local government areas that make up the district,” Dr Onoyona said. In a statement he later released after an online interview with the paper, the estate mogul with huge interests across the country said that the consultation turned out to be a carnival of a sort. “People turned up em mass across the eight local government areas that make up our zone. “It was a mass mobilisation of people,” he said. The newspaper learnt that Dr Onoyona’s consultation train moved across the entire Delta South Senatorial district where he is seeking support and a mandate to represent the district in the Senate come May 2023. POLL His team was said to have stormed communities as he appealed for support and nomination to fly the APC flag at the forthcoming party primaries. An Isoko born businessman, Onoyona’s ambition throws up interest after several months of speculations from the four blocs of the district: Urhobo, Isoko, Ijaw and Itsekiri over the strong lobby to have Dr Onoyona throw his hat into the ring of the contest. The meeting where he spoke to stakeholders of the Senatorial zone was held at the Wellington Hotel, Effurun, with party chairmen and chieftains from the eight LGAs present. The local governments represented were: Warri South,  Warri North, Warri South-West, Patani and Bomadi. Others are: Bututu, Isoko South and Isoko North.
