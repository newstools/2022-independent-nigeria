Twenty trucks carrying food aid entered territory controlled by Ethiopia’s rebellious Tigrayan forces on Friday, the United Nations said, the first small but concrete demonstration that a unilateral truce the government declared last week has improved aid access. It is unclear how much more aid might follow or how quickly. More than 90% of the 5.5 million people in the northern province of Tigray need food aid, according to the United Nations. Around 100 trucks of aid per day need to enter to meet the population’s needs. No trucks have been able to enter since Dec. 15, due to a combination of bureaucratic problems and fighting. “Just arrived in Erepti and will soon cross into Tigray, bringing in over 500 metric tonnes of urgently needed WFP/partner food and nutrition supplies for communities on edge of starvation,” World Food Programme Ethiopia, a U.N. agency, said on its Twitter account. The convoy was expected to arrive in Tigray’s capital, Mekelle, “soon” the agency said, adding that another convoy with more than 1,000 metric tonnes of food would be sent to the neighbouring region of northern Afar on Friday afternoon to deliver “to communities in dire need”. Erepti is one of six districts in Afar currently controlled by Tigrayan forces. Tigray’s government welcomed the development. “The bottom line, though, isn’t about how many trucks are allowed but whether there is a system in place to ensure unfettered humanitarian access for the needy!” Getachew Reda, Tigray regional government’s spokesperson, said on Twitter.
