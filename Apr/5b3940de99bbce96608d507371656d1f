The Command identified the suspects as Steve Green,38-year-old and Adaugo Darlington, a female who usually pretends to be pregnant to attract sympathy, poses as passengers, attacks the drivers with knives and machetes and pushes them down while still in motion. The syndicate however ran out of luck on March 31, 2022, along Rumunduru Eneka in Obio / Akpor  Local Government Area of the state when police operatives of Eneka Division, while on routine patrol, got to the scene where their last victim, one Lasisi Akreem was dispossessed of his tricycle.

A statement by the acting PPRO of the Command, DSP Grace Iringe-Koko said, the victim was rushed to the hospital for medical treatment while efforts are on to nab the two others who escaped.  “Investigation has commenced”, she said.
