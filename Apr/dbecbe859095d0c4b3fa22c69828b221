IBADAN – The Academic Staff Union of University, Ladoke Akintola Uni­versity of Technology chapter on Thursday asked Governor Seyi Makinde to impress it on the Vice Chancellor, Professor Mojeed Olaide Liasu, and the Chairman Governing Council Professor Deji Omole, to pay seven years of arrears of earned academic allowances owed academic staff of the institution. The union also blamed the leadership of the university for denying academics their due promotion arrears. In a release jointly signed by the Chairman, Professors Biodun Olaniran, and Toyin Abegunrin, Secretary, respectively entitled “LAUTECH Administration: A Slave Driver”, the union leaders put the amount being owed them at over five billion naira. The ASUU leaders said their members have lost confidence in the university administration led by the acting Vice chancellor and the Deji Omole-led Governing council to pursue their welfare. While urging the governor to immediately intervene before the situation degenerated into crisis in LAUTECH, they said, “It is rather unfortunate that the 2016 and 2017 avoidable crisis started because the then administration refused to address arrears of EAA. Apparently not learning from history, the present univer­sity administration and council are now towing the same path” Olaniran and Abegunrin said, “Our union cooperated with the administration to realize the debt from students with the un­derstanding that our EAA and promotion arrears will be settled, knowing full well that at least one third of it could be paid. However, as against our understanding, the university administration went ahead to appropriate the realized money on acclaimed capital proj­ects and none of the two arrears was attended to.”
