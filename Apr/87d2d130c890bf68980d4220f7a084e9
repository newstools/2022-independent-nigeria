 . Blames attack on rival political party The All Progressive Congress (APC) in Lagelu Local Government Area of Oyo State, has condemned the attack on the party secretariat located at Cele Bus-Stop along Olodo-Iwo-Road expressway, Ibadan, last Saturday. While condemning the attack, Chairman of APC in the local government, Chief Oyewumi Oyegoke, alleged that some men suspected to be working for a major political party in the state invaded the party office around 9pm on Saturday and started destroying chairs, banners and other facilities in sight. Oyegoke stated that:”It is quite unfortunate we are witnessing this kind of attack at a time like this when we are preparing for the general elections coming up next year. I was told that the attackers came in three buses and were armed with cutlasses, guns and other weapons. “They were heard saying that they do not want to see any other political party office except theirs right from Iwo-Road to Olodo and environs. “I actually don’t understand this, are they trying to turn Oyo State into one-party state? This kind of acts must stop. The police and other relevant security agencies must be alive to their responsibility of ensuring the security of lives and property.” “It is on this note that I call on the Inspector General of Police, Assistant Inspector General of Police, Zone 11, Osogbo, Commissioner of Police in Oyo State and other key security officers in the country to please come to our aid by getting those who carried out the operation arrested and also make moves to avert future occurence. Oyegoke further stated that:”Instead of attacking our party offices the opposition party should rather engage in coming up with a political strategy capable of winning elections into various elective offices in the 2023 general elections.
