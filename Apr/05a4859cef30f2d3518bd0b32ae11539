Rivers United’s Nelson Esor says the Pride of Rivers would not relent in their push to win the ongoing 2021/2022 Nigeria Professional Football League (NPFL). The former champions are four points clear at the top of the table with 55 points from 25 games, with Plateau United placed second with 51 points with 13 rounds of matches left for play. Esor was speaking after they made light walk of Niger Tornadoes at the Yakubu Gowon Stadium in Port Harcourt, describing their 1-0 loss penultimate week to Sunshine Stars in Akure as unfortunate. ”I’m very happy that I came in and gave two assists. It was a nice and good game; we got the three maximum points with three goals. We played with a lot of confidence and courage playing at home”, Esor told. He has been a regular feature in the team since he joined from Go Round FC four years ago and is confident that River United will emerge champions come the end of the season. “We’re already there leading the log with four points. We’ll keep the momentum on without slowing down the pace. Keep moving till the end of the season and I believe at the end, we’ll emerge champions. POLL But Esor also thinks it was not yet time to celebrate warning that the job is not yet completed. “We don’t need to relent but to keep fighting, doing more hard work, remember they say hard work pays, so we’ll keep fighting till the end.” Recall that after their second defeat of the season (against Sunshine), which slowed down their push for the title, Rivers United needed a big statement and they showed class and made a big claim on the title with the 3-0 bashing of Tornadoes in Port Harcourt.
