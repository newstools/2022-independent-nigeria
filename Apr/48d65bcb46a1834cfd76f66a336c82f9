Prior to his movement, Osinbajo is a chieftain of the Lagos APC with his polling unit at Code 33, Unit 2 Victoria Garden City, Lagos. However, speaking with DAILY INDEPENDENT yesterday, Hon. Seye Oladejo, the Publicity Secretary of the Lagos APC said they are not aware that Osinbajo has moved his membership to Ogun state. “We are not aware but if they are claiming that he has moved his voting unit to Ikenne in Ogun state, so technically he has to be a member of the party in Ogun now. But no official communication from him was received by the party of his movement to Ogun state,” he said.
