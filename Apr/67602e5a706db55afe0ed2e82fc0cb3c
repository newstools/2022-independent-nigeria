LAGOS – The National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control (NAFDAC) has blocked the shipment of more than 80 substandard medicine products from Chi­na and India over fraudulent activities by the manufactur­ers, even as Nigeria is set to begin the production of vac­cines by the end of 2022. Prof Christiana Adey­eye, Director-General of the Agency, who spoke to jour­nalists in Lagos on Tuesday, disclosed that the agency has procured 40 units of a handheld device valued at $57,000 dollars each, capable of detecting the quality and quantity of medicinal prod­ucts in the country. She said, “We are work­ing day and night to ensure that by the end of the year we will start manufacturing vaccines but that does not mean that we will produce a completely developed vac­cine. “The government has gone through different ways to ensure that these happen. “But, the government also has an arrangement with Biovaccines Government has 49 percent May and Bak­er 51 percent and it started a long time ago but not just covid-19 vaccine.” Adeyeye explained that in an effort to reduce the percentage of fake products in the country, the agency toured 19 pharmaceutical companies in China and India.
