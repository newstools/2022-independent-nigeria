The United States has pledged to move “Heaven and Earth” to help Ukraine win its battle against Russia’s unprovoked invasion, as allies from 40 nations met at a US base in Germany to bolster Kyiv’s defence against Moscow. The meeting called by the US at its Ramstein airbase in southwestern Germany aims “to help Ukraine win the fight against Russia’s unjust invasion and to build up Ukraine’s defences for tomorrow’s challenges”, said defence secretary Lloyd Austin as he opened the talks. “As we see this morning, nations from around the world stand united in our resolve to support Ukraine in its fight against Russia’s imperial aggression. “Ukraine clearly believes that it can win and so does everyone here,” he added. The US is already the biggest supplier of international military aid to Ukraine and Austin said Washington is “going to keep moving Heaven and Earth so that we can meet” Kyiv’s needs. At the talks, German defence minister Christine Lambrecht said Berlin has agreed to give the go-ahead to the delivery of used Gepard anti-aircraft tanks to Ukraine. The move towards heavy weapons deliveries marked a turning point from Germany’s timid backing for Kyiv which has put Chancellor Olaf Scholz under fire at home and abroad. Lambrecht admitted that the Bundeswehr’s weapons stocks are limited, but said it will turn to the inventory of Germany’s armaments manufacturers.
