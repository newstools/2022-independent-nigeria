Ibadan – Nigeria Union of Journalists (NUJ), Oyo State council, on Sunday bemoaned the attack of a radio station in Ibadan, Fresh FM, owned by ace gospel musician, Yinka Ayefele, calling on the police to fish out perpetrators of the heinous act. A three-member gang armed with guns had stormed the station in the early hours of the day and dispossessed staff of phones, laptops, ATM cards, and other electronic gadgets. The union in a statement by its chairman, Demola Babalola, condemned the invasion of the station and called for a probe of the attack. The NUJ also called on the Commissioner of Police, Ngozi Onadeko, to swing into action with a view to fishing out the gang to forestall future recurrence on other media houses in particular and the general public in general. According to Babalola, “The attack on Fresh FM came to the NUJ as a rude shock. Here is a station that has been globally applauded for its rich content and pro-masses agenda. “The rascals who carried out such heinous crime against Fresh FM and inflicted hardship on the staffers of the station must be apprehended without much ado. “I hereby call on the commissioner of police to set up a high powered investigative team of detectives to ensure long arm of the law catches up with those intruders. POLL “This is to also appeal to the management of Fresh FM under Evang. Yinka Ayefele and my colleagues not to allow this development affect their contributions to nation building and the good work they are doing for a better Oyo State and Nigeria as a whole.
