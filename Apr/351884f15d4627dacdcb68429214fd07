UYO -The chairman, Resource Intermediaries Limited, Operators of theBUNKer Co-Work facilities, Dr Ebun Bambgoye says inflation and insecurity as factors sitting on the wheels of business progress in Ni­geria Bamgboye said apart from inflation disrupting proper planning, it also creates a fi­nancial burden for young busi­nesses with limited finances at their disposal. Addressing a press confer­ence to herald the launch and formal opening of the Uyo of­fice of theBUNKer, on Wednes­day, the company’s Chairman explained that the rate of insecurity in the country has put strains on start-ups on the need to increase surveillance as well as made some cities business-unfriendly. He, however, said the need to circumvent those and oth­er challenges, was what gave birth to theBUNKer concept of sharing a secure work en­vironment without necessar­ily paying a whole month or year’s rent. “This disruption of work and the unavailability of large funds to rent an office in a commercial area has led to the increasing demand for co-work spaces by start-up en­trepreneurs, freelancers and remote employees.”
