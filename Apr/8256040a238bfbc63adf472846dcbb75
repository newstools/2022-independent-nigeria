WARRI – A two-time gubernatorial candidate, Micheal Aristotle Ighofose, has indicated interest for the governorship seat of Delta State to succeed Governor Ifeanyi Okowa in 2023. Ighofose joined the governorship race on the platform of the All Progressives Congress (APC) Ughelli North Local Government Area, Delta State. Mike Eyamekuare, Special Assistant to the APC chieftain, in a statement, on Tuesday at Ughelli, said, ” Ighofose, a twotime governorship candidate of then All Nigeria Peoples Party (ANPP) in Delta State, has succumbed to pressure from friends and political associates in Delta State, Nigeria and abroad to join the state governorship for 2023. “Yes Micheal Ighofose has accepted and indicated interest to contest the governorship on the platform of the All Progressives Congress APC in Delta State. But he is still consulting with relevant leaders and stakeholders before the official declaration.” He expressed confidence that should Ighofose declare interest for governorship, he is sure to secure the APC governorship ticket at the primary.
