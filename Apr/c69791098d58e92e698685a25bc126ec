3M-2022 Brief Performance Review United Capital (UCAP) Plc today, 13 April 2022 released its unaudited financial statements for the period-ended 31 March (3M-22) 2022 to the market. By this feat, it became the first quoted company to have made available its unaudited financials for period ending 31 March to the Nigerian Exchange Group (NGX) ahead of the 30-day deadline (after the due date). Top and bottom-lines rises by 35.0%y/y and 39.1%y/y apiece A quick analysis of the results showed that both Gross Earnings (GE) and Profit After Tax (PAT) expanded by 35.0% and 39.1% to settle at N4.21 billion and N2.31 billion respectively compared to the numbers achieved in 3M-2021. The growth in revenue was bolstered by improved returns in the following line items – investment income, and fees & commission income – which grew by 3.1% and 32.2% to settle at N1.64bn (38.9% of GE), and N1.75bn (41.5% of GE) respectively. This feat is highly commendable and showed management dexterity in navigating through the murky business environment laced with structural challenges and variability of yields.
