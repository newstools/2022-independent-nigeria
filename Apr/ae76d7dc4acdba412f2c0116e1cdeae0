The presidential aspirants and Governor of Rivers State, Nyesom Wike on Saturday revealed who the leadership of the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) will give the presidential ticket for the anticipated 2023 general elections. Wike who spoke at a grand reception put together for him by the people of Kalabari ethnic nationality at the Abalama School field in Asari Toru Local Government Area said that PDP will only give its sole presidential ticket to a candidate who has the interest of Nigerians at heart. According to him, the main opposition party would not be browbeaten into surrendering its presidential ticket to selfish politicians who would serve only the interest of the wealthy few in Nigeria. Governor Wike also said that Nigeria will shake when the south finally makes its decisions regarding the 2023 presidential election public. Wike in a statement issued by his Special Assistant on Media, Kelvin Ebiri, reiterated that political leaders in the south will soon come out with their decision concerning the country’s number one position. Wike said: “The day the south will speak, Nigeria will shake. We believe in the unity of this country, but nobody can threaten us. Nobody should threaten us. We believe in the unity of Nigeria and unity of Nigeria must continue.” He added, “No amount of gang-up can make PDP give somebody who will want to run an election for the interest of some big men, and not for all Nigerians. “Anybody who wants to be the candidate of PDP must be a candidate for the interest of Nigerians.”
