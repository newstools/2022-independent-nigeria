Mr Josef Onoh, a Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) governorship aspirant in Enugu State, says he hopes to emerge the party’s flag bearer for the 2023 polls. Onoh said this in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Enugu on Wednesday. “I am hopeful and confident that I will successfully undergo party’s screening and emerge PDP candidate,” he said. He said that his confidence was based on his plans and programmes for the people, which gave him an edge over other aspirants. He said he was aware of the people’s needs and expectations and would work towards achieving them, if elected as governor. “Whatever Enugu people want me to do, I will incorporate them into my own plans and put them into action. “The achievement I recorded as the Chairman, Enugu Capital Territory Development Authority (ECTDA) is enough evidence that I am going to perform well. Onoh, who is the current Chairman of ECTDA, promised to continue from Gov. Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi’s developmental strides, in order to take the state to greater height. (NAN)(
