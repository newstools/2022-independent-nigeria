Following the recurring collapse of the national power grid, the Federal Government has set up a high-powered investigation committee to look into the issue and make recommendations. The committee will probe the immediate and remote causes of the frequent collapse, a situation that has now become embarrassing to the Federal Government. A statement from the Office of the Minister of Power, said that the process of restoring supply is ongoing with some sections of the national grid already energised and supply restored to consumers. “We wish to notify the general public of the incidence of a system collapse, which occurred at 1830hrs on April 8, 2022, resulting in power outages in many parts of the country. “While a detailed investigation into the immediate and remote causes of the recurring grid failure is currently ongoing by the Nigerian Electricity Regulatory Commission and System Operator (the operator of the national grid), the process of restoring supply is ongoing with some sections of the national grid already energised and supply restored to consumers. “We wish to assure Nigerians that the Federal Government is working assiduously to deliver on the much-needed reforms and investments, including Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA), that are critical to improving the capacity and reliability of the national grid. This is in line with Mr President’s directives on closing infrastructure deficits in critical sectors of the Nigerian economy”, the statement explained.
