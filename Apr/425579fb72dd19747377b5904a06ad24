The new Director of National Orientation Agency (NOA) in Oyo State, Mr Odedokun Kayode has beseeched Oyo citizens and Nigerians at large on the need for attitudinal re-orientation and patronizing Nigeria home made goods as a pathway to Nigeria’s progress and economic viability and stability. This was contained in his maiden speech to felicitate Nigerians on Easter celebrations. Odedokun in a message he personally signed and made available to journalists in Ibadan through the Head of media of the Agency, Alhaji Isiaka-Adeniyi admonished the citizens not to be distracted from the grim realities on ground. He pleaded for moderate celebrations and prayers for the country to tide over the challenges besetting it. He further urged Nigerians to patronize Nigerian homemade goods towards ensuring a reduction in Capital flights among others and bringing down unemployment in the country. The Director emphasised that government at all levels cannot solve the challenges alone, hence, urging Nigerians to join hands to save Nigeria’s ship from hurtling down the rapids. “If it swamps we have no other country to call our own, everyone must rise up and partake in the revolution of the minds, which is the seed of all revolutions as good people of a great country”. The Director, therefore, urged the people not to lag behind in their moral services to the nation particularly patronizing homemade goods. POLL “It’s our collective responsibility to rescue the Nation ‘s Ship”, he counselled. The State Director, therefore, rejoices with the Christians and non-Christians alike on this year’s Easter celebrations saying, “I  extend my seasonal greetings and warm regards to the State Governor and all members of his cabinet, the imperial majesty, Alaafin of Oyo, the imperial majesty, Olubadan of Ibadanland and all the traditional Councils members in the State, community heads and all the people of Oyo State. I wish all a happy Easter celebrations”.
