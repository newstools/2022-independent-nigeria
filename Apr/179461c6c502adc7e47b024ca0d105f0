Everton forward Richarlison has reportedly been “offered’ to Premier League rivals Arsenal. The Brazilian international joined the Toffees from Watford in 2018 and has scored 50 times in 147 appearances for the Merseyside club. With Everton’s Premier League status in jeopardy, Richarlison is widely expected to be one of many players to move on this summer if they are relegated. He has been linked with Manchester United and Arsenal with both clubs keen on bringing in at least one striker in the summer transfer window. Gunners boss Arteta is keen to improve his attacking options with his only first team strikers, Eddie Nketiah and Alexandre Lacazette, both out of contract at the end of the season. Richarlison has more than two years left on his Everton contract and reportedly earns £110,000 per week. Transfer insider Dean Jones has reported that the 24-year-old has been offered to Arsenal. Jones told Give Me Sport: “I think Arsenal definitely have a possibility of signing Richarlison. POLL “They know that he could leave Everton and is likely to leave Everton in the summer. They’ve been offered the chance to sign him.” Meanwhile, Rio Ferdinand has said that Man City striker Gabriel Jesus would be a good signing for the Gunners. It was reported last week that Mikel Arteta is keen on signing Richarlison’s compatriot, with the player also open to the idea of relocating to north London. “You speak to players about him, they appreciate him because he puts a good workload in, he has got quality,” Ferdinand said on his Vibe with Five YouTube channel. “I think if he plays consistently in a team like Arsenal, I think he gets you goals. “By the way, [Eddie] Nketiah at the weekend [against Manchester United] I thought was brilliant. Held up the ball well, brought others into the game.”
