LAGOS  – The Nigeria Customs Service (NCS), Kebbi Area Command has intercepted and seized 32 goods from suspected smugglers in the month of March, 2022. Comptroller Joseph Attah, Custom Area Controller of the Command disclosed during a press briefing. The Customs boss noted that feat was achieved due to the renewed and sustained clampdown on smuggling activities in the Command, which he said, “has yielded a total number of thirty two seizures for the period under review. He said the seized goods include 579 jerry cans, equivalent to 14,475 liters of Premium Motor Spirit (PMS), 45 bales of second hand clothes; 45 bags of foreign parboiled rice of 50KG each, 320 sacks of scrap metals; two (Daf) trucks used as means of conveying smuggled goods and one used Ford Edge vehicle; among others. Comptroller Attah said the Duty Paid Value (DPV) of the items stood N87,707,985:00. “In line with extant laws, most of the inflammable products have been auctioned to government agencies, with the amount generated as fees remitted to government coffers. What you are seeing now is part of it which will also be auctioned immediately after this briefing. “Worthy of note is the fact that petrol smuggling through the Command has continued to be on the decrease in the face of sustained offensive against the illicit trade. “Those who thought they can use motorcycles to ferry jerry cans of PMS through bush paths are counting their losses going by the activities of the Command’s anti-bunkering team. POLL “The profit motive that drives smuggling is being scuttled. It is therefore reasonable for such people to embrace legitimate means of livelihood.”
