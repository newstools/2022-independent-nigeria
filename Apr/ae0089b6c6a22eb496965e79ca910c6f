The People’s Democratic Party (PDP) presidential candidate and former VicePresident, Atiku Abubakar on Saturday revealed that he was never a party to the northern consensus arrangement ahead of the party primaries slated for May 28th and 29th. This is sequel to a communique read by former Ahmadu Bello University Vice-Chancellor, Professor Ango Abdullahi on Friday that the Northern Elders have endorsed the immediate past President of the Senate, Dr Bukola Saraki and Bauchi State Governor, Senator Bala Mohamed. It could be recalled that Saraki alongside the Governor of Sokoto State, Aminu Waziri Tambuwal and Governor Bala Mohammed were the ones who front the northern consensus arrangement ahead of the party’s primaries and 2023 general elections. However, the Sokoto State Governor, Aminu Waziri Tambuwal who was part of the arrangement at the initial stage refuted the report, saying the consensus arrangement collapsed on Wednesday. Reacting to the development in a statement issued by the Technical Committee (TEECOM) for the actualization of Atiku Abubakar’s Presidency in the 2023 general elections, the group explained that Atiku did not subject himself to any purported consensus arrangement. The statement partly read, “Therefore, he is not bound by any of the recommendations and conclusions of the purported report. “Waziri Atiku Abubakar as a nationalist strongly believes that Nigeria has never been so divided as it is today, and any regional, zonal, ethno-religious gang up or consensus-driven in this manner will further deepen and widen the wounds that urgently require to be healed. “He is anxious to implement plans, policies and programmes that will rescue and rebuild Nigeria POLL “Finally, we urge our supporters to continue with consultations and town hall meetings with delegates across the country as the party prepares for the presidential primaries scheduled for Saturday/ Sunday May 28 and 29, 2022.”
