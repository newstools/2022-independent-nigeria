Lagos – After missing Napoli’s victory at Atalanta, the Partenopeans have revealed that the Super Eagles striker, Victor Osimhen, is fit and ready for their next clash against Fiorentina on Sunday. Osimhen missed Napoli’s 3-1 victory at Atalanta last week, and there were reports that the Super Eagles star could be on the sidelines for a little while. However, after running tests on the 23-year-old, the Partenopeans have clarified that their most expensive signing is fit as a fiddle and would be available when Napoli host Fiorentina on Sunday. Osimhen is having the time of his life in the Serie A this season. The former Lille man has notched 11 goals and three assists in 20 appearances for Napoli. And Luciano Spalletti would bank on his star striker to deliver the goods as Napoli look to claim their first Scudetto in 32 years. The Super Eagles hit man was recently voted Serie A’s March Player of the Month. Since his big-money move from Ligue 1 club Lille to Napoli in August, the Super Eagle has been a key figure in the Naples based squad. Victory for Napoli against Fiorentina will keep their title bid on track. Eight days later, the Blues welcome Jose Mourinho’s AS Roma to Stadio Diego Armando Maradona.
