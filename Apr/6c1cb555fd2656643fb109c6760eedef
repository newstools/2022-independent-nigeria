American Pam Shriver, a winner of 22 Grand Slam doubles titles, says she was in an “inappropriate and damaging” relationship with former coach Don Candy during her playing career. The former world number one said the pair’s relation­ship started when she was 17 and Candy was 50. “Don never abused me sex­ually, but I would say there was emotional abuse,” she told the Daily Telegraph. Shriver, now 59, said the relationship ended in 1984 when she was 22. “The short version of this story is that I had an inap­propriate and damaging relationship with my much older coach, which began when I was 17 and lasted a little over five years,” she wrote. Australian Candy died in 2020, aged 91. “If Don had been better in­formed, he might have been cannier about the potential complications that come with coaching an adolescent girl. Clearly, he wasn’t a pred­ator,” she added. “I still have conflicted feel­ings about Don. Yes, he and I became involved in a long and inappropriate affair. Yes, he was cheating on his wife. But there was a lot about him that was honest and authen­tic. And I loved him. Even so, he was the grown-up here. He should have been the trust­worthy adult. POLL “Only after therapy did I start to feel a little less re­sponsible. Now, at last, I’ve come to realise that what happened is on him.” Shriver says she is moti­vated to tell her story now because she believes pres­ent-day players are in similar situations. “I believe abusive coach­ing relationships are alarm­ingly common in sport as a whole,” she added. “My particular expertise, though, is in tennis, where I have witnessed dozens of instances in my four and a bit decades as a player and commentator.
