BENIN – The Esan Agenda Development Worldwide (EADW), a socio-cultural group, has cautioned aspirants to various elective positions in all the political parties to refrain from the use of foul language in their engagements as they canvass for support ahead of their party primaries. EADW gave the admonition in a statement signed by its president, Elder Gary Utubor Irabor and noted that having watched the political scene from the sideline in the past few months, the group is now in a better position to offer useful recommendations to the political gladiators in Edo Central Senatorial District and Edo State at large. According to the statement, ” EADW has observed with reservations the attitude of some political gladiators who appear bent on stoking the war narratives and unnecessary heating up of the polity, and thereby calls on the political players to adopt civility and decorum to their campaign approach. The Forum will not be a party to any election war mongering in Edo Central Senatorial District as well as Edo State at large and condemns it in its entirety. “The Forum equally take a stance against the use of blackmail and slanderous narratives to drive political contents in this season and warn all its members to back out from blackmail camps and be thoroughly professional in their crafts. EADW wishes for issue-based campaigns not black on the media. “Ultimately, EADW identifies peace as the basic panacea for meaningful development in any society and has urged Edo Central Senatorial and Edo State people, in general, to embrace peace for a sustained future. “To keep pace and ensure adherence to its recommendations, EADW will from henceforth, emerge more visible on State issues, so as to help establish positive public opinion ahead of the 2023 election, for elections will come and go, Edo Central Senatorial District and Edo State will remain for all of us,” the statement noted.
