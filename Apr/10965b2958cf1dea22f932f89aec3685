Vocal social commentator and former actress, Georgina Onuoha has lauded Ukraine’s former president, Petro Poroshenko for enlisting to join in the war with Russia. According to her statesmanship and love of country are tested during difficult times. In an Instagram post, Onuoha expressed hope that someday Nigeria will produce leaders in that mould, who are ready to defend their nation against an aggressive invader. “This is the Former Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko as he dons battle gear in Kyiv. He is bearing arms to defend his current. Mind you, the current president Zelenskyy defeated him in the 2019 election. But today, they stand side by side defending their homeland against an army. “I pray someday; I can take such pride in seeing our nation’s leaders defend Nigeria this way. There are so many moral lessons to learn from this war against Ukraine by Russia,” she captioned photographs of the former president in military gear. According to information, Ukraine’s former president, Petro Poroshenko, appears to have joined fighting forces defending the capital city of Kyiv. He was recently the political rival of current President Volodymyr Zelensky, losing his re-election bid to the TV celebrity in 2019. “We are in the centre of Kyiv; we are here to protect Ukraine. The invaders are a little bit more than 2 kilometres (1.2 miles) from here. We want to be free. We want to be democratic. And we want to return back our country to the European family,” Poroshenko, 56, was quoted to have said. He wore a bullet-proof vest as soldiers moved about behind him. Poroshenko brandished a Kalashnikov rifle in a recent CNN interview while listing the small arms held by his unit and declaring that Ukraine can hold out forever. He was the fifth president of Ukraine, serving in office from 2014 to 2019, known as a pro-Ukrainian nationalist who worked to separate the nation from its former USSR-era overlords in Moscow and align more with the West.
