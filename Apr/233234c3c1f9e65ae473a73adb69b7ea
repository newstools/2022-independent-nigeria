Former Secretary to Ekiti Government, Modupe Alade, has debunked the reports of her being at loggerheads with the state former Governor Ayo Fayose. She disclosed this on Friday while speaking to reports, at the close of burial of her mother-on-law, Mrs Dorcas Abike Alade, in Ifaki-Ekiti. Alade said, “I am still very much in politics, and a proud member of PDP for that matter. I have neither called it quits with PDP or Fayose or anybody for that matter. I still remain in PDP till this time of speaking with you, so where is the crisis? “The only thing I think has happened which I can not control, is that I am never interested in seeking elective offices, and this is probably due to the civil service blood that is still flowing in me, even as a retired Permanent Secretary. “Though ideologies may differ some of the time, there is no crisis between me and Ex-governor Fayose. I will tell you he remains my mentor, and I am still loyal to him. Do not forget that he was the one that appointed me Secretary to the State Government at a time.”
