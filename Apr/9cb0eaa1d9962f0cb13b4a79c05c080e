The UK announced on 21 April 2022 that it will introduce import bans on silver, wood products and other high-end products from Russia including caviar. The UK also announced that it will increase tariffs by 35 percentage points on certain products from Russia and Belarus. The products which will face the additional 35 percent tariff (on top of any tariffs that are currently applicable) range from arms and ammunition, pharmaceutical products, rubber, textiles to luxury items such as leather and diamonds. The import tariffs and bans affect over GBP 1 billion of Russian goods. The UK has noted that legislation will be laid in due course in order to implement these measures.
