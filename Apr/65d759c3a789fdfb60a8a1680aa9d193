*Elections Peaceful, Processes Free And Fair MAKURDI – Voters’ apathy greeted the Local Government Council (LGC) elections that were held across Benue state last Saturday. However, Daily Independent can authoritatively report that the election was generally conducted under a peaceful atmosphere. While we observed that the processes of the elections were free and fair, we also observed that electoral materials and election officials arrived the polling units on time. DAILY INDEPENDENT also noticed that as early as 9:30am, voters started trickling into some of the polling stations situated in Wailomayo ward to vote candidates of their choice. Even though, observers that monitored the elections in the state hailed the peaceful conduct of the elections, they decried the low turnout of voters for the elections. Acting Chairman, Forum of State Independent Electoral Commissions of Nigeria, Barrister Jossy Eze also corroborated our findings. Eze who spoke to newsmen in Makurdi after while in the process of monitoring the elections said, he particularly noted that voters were not intimidated into voting. POLL According to him, “So far, the places we visited I noticed that the election was peaceful; there is general voter apathy as regards the number of voters, viz-a-viz the number we have seen from the ballot boxes. “Although, the turnout is low, there is still time, people are still ready to vote and people will still come to vote, since the closing time would be at about 4pm and this is midday. “We also noticed that the atmosphere around the polling booths are conducive for people to come out and vote, no intimidation, but surprisingly we do not see party agents and we also do not see enough security personnel,” he pointed out.
