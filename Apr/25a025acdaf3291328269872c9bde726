Covid infections have hit a record high across the UK – just as free Covid-19 testing for millions in England comes to an end. Some 4.9 million people in the UK are estimated to have had Covid-19 in the week ending March 26, up from 4.3 million in the previous week, the Office for National Statistics said. The ONS data shows one in 13 people in England are estimated to have had Covid during that week, up from one in 16 the week before, and in Wales, the figure is one in 14 people, up from one in 16 the week before. Both are record highs. From Friday, people in England need to turn to the high street for tests if they want them. Kara Steel, the senior statistician for the ONS Covid-19 infection survey, said: “Infection levels remain high, with the highest levels recorded in our survey seen in England and Wales and notable increases among older age groups. “The rapid rise continues to be fuelled by the growth of the Omicron BA.2 variant across the UK.” Earlier, Professor Tim Spector from King’s College London, who runs the Zoe Covid tracking app, said the timing of the end of free testing “couldn’t really be worse”.
