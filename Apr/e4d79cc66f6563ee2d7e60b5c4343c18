KANO – University dons under the auspices of the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU) during the weekend declared that the deployment of UTAS is key to the resolution of the ongoing dispute between the body and the federal government. Comrade Abdulkadir Muhammad, Zonal Coordinator, ASUU Kano zone, told newsmen that failure to deploy the module would exacerbate industrial disharmony in national life. ASUU Kano zone comprises of Ahmadu Bello University, Zaria, Bayero University Kano, Kaduna State University, Kano University of Science and Technology, Federal University Dutse, Yusuf Maitama Sule University, Kano and Sule Lamido University, Kafin Hausa. Comrade Muhammad explained that “it is our hope that the federal government will to the line of honour to allow the ongoing integrity tests to be finalised for quick deployment of UTAS in the interest of the Nigerian public university system.” ASUU, however, lampooned the NITDA DG over its alleged unfriendly stance on UTAS, as they called on the federal government to prioritize character and competence in the appointment of public officeholders. Comrade Abdulkadir Muhammad explained that “it is embarrassing that the DG NITDA is either ignorant of or unpatriotically forsake a fundamental mandate of the agency he superintends: promoting local innovation like UTAS”. He enjoined stakeholders, religious and traditional leaders, media, and the general public to be vigilant by joining the struggle to save the Nigerian University system from neo-liberal attacks.
