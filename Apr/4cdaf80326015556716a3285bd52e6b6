…Says he has no case to answer with EFCC MINNA – Countdown to the 2023 general election, Niger State governorship aspirant, Alhaji Isah Liman Kantigi, has vowed to unseat the ruling All Progressive Congress (APC) if given the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) ticket in the state next year. Kantigi, the former Commissioner for Local Government and Chieftaincy Affairs in the past dispensation however said he is ready for the Economic and Financial Crime Commission (EFCC) as he has no case to answer with the anti-crime agency. Kantigi, who is the latest to join the over twenty guber aspirants or both APC and PDP, from Zone ‘A’ told supporters at the state PDP secretariat after announcing a donation of N1 million each to the six Local Government Areas badly affected by armed bandits that he would run an open-door government with equity and fairness to all Nigerlites. He told delegates from across the state who had converged at the party secretariat along eastern by-pass to felicitate with members on the Ramadan fast that PDP is the best platform that meets the needs of the masses and if given the mandate will rescue Niger from the APC misrule and restore the state to its lost glory. While pleading with the delegates to consider him as the most qualified for the number one seat in the state as he is ready to carry everybody along, Kantigi assured of, a government that will consider the needs of the citizenry above that of his. Meanwhile, Kantigi has challenged the EFCC that he is available for their probing and verifications as he has no case with them whatsoever as being speculated, adding that the EFCC are humans not spirits and when invited he will be ready to honour their invitation. Kantigi, who, however, clarified his position with an adage said, “A broom can sweep and would sweep a lot of dirty things”, said he is more concerned about how to end the hardship inflicted on Nigerians, Nigerlites in particular by the present administration. If emerge as Governor of Niger state come 2023, Kantigi assured that citizens will be relieved of the pains and hardship they are currently going through, describing the PDP as ‘a party from God Almighty that allowed welfare and security for all while other political parties believed in individualism despite the suffering of others’. POLL The PDP guber hopeful accused the APC of hiding monies meant for the masses in their fridges at the expense of the impoverished citizenry and promised more support towards the growth and development of the party in the state including the purchase of forms for many aspirants who have indicated interest to contest in the 2023 general elections.
