There are strong indication that the Lagos State Governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu may likely run for the 2023 gubernatorial election with the incumbent Secretary to the State Government (SSG), Folashade Jaji as running mate. This followed revelation that Sanwo-Olu’s Deputy Governor, Dr Obafemi Kadiri may likely vie for a senatorial seat on the platform of the All Progressives Congress, (APC). Daily Independent gathered that the choice of Jaji as the Deputy Governor is being considered to balance the gender equation as well as attract the full support of womenfolk which forms the bulk of the voters and give them a sense of belonging. It is instructive to note that during the previous administrations in the state, particularly, former governors Babatunde Fashola and Akinwumi Ambode had female deputies. Hamzat had always been rumoured to have the plan of relocating to Epe after the first tenure with Sanwo-Olu where he initially intended to run for the office of Governor before reshaping it to senatorial after power bloc advice. In the wake, he was advised to relocate to Ifako/Ijaiye and contest the Lagos West Senatorial district which is vacant because of the incumbent, Senator Solomon Olamilekan, popularly called, Yayi, relocating to Ogun West. Interestingly, quite a number of aspirants have started emerging for the West Senatorial District to replace Yayi. Notable among then is former Minister of Defence, Senator Musiliu Obanikoro, whose colourful posters could be seen at various corners of the district. Others are Senior Special Assistant to President Muhammadu Buhari on Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) Mrs Joke Orelope-Adefulire, and Dr Idiat Adebule, both former deputy governors and former Commissioner for Transportation, Comrade Kayode Opeifa and still counting.
