LAGOS  – ExxonMobil Foundation, in collaboration with ExxonMobil affiliate Companies in Nigeria, have announced renewed support for partner organizations committed to ending malaria in Nigeria. These grants, among other scheduled activities for World Malaria Day, mark the 20th anniversary of ExxonMobil’s support for programs to reduce the burden of malaria in Nigeria. For the past 20 years, ExxonMobil’s Malaria Initiative said it has provided more than $37.4 million (over N15 billion) in cash grants to partners working to develop community-based solutions in Nigeria. Continuing this legacy, ExxonMobil has announced its 2022 grant recipients, including, PanAfricare, in conjunction with NBA Power Forward, to foster the development of youth in Nigeria through sports, life skills and malaria education. “This World Malaria Day, we mark ExxonMobil’s contributions over the past two decades that have helped equip and strengthen resilience within our communities to fight against malaria,” said Richard Laing, Chairman and Managing Director of ExxonMobil affiliate Companies in Nigeria. “Thanks to these efforts, Nigeria is better prepared to continue the progress we have made and work toward a malaria-free future.” ExxonMobil’s Malaria Initiative works with nonprofit partners and leading global health organizations to advance progress against the disease in malaria-endemic countries by supporting malaria education and awareness, improving access to tools for prevention, diagnosis and treatment, strengthening health infrastructure and advancing research and innovation. The initiative continues to support malaria prevention and control programs in Nigeria, a country which currently accounts for more than one quarter of the global burden of the disease. POLL In honor of World Malaria Day, these partners are focused on leveraging the power of sports and media to reach Nigerian youth, through malaria-themed tournaments and creative radio, television and school-based malaria campaigns, among other activities.
