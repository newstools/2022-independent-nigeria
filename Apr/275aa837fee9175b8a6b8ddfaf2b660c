LAGOS  – International Breweries Plc, a proud member of Anheuser-Busch InBev, a global beer brand, has organised a Smart Drinking Roundtable Session in furtherance of its commitment to Smart Drinking and implementation of effective and collaborative solutions to disrupt harmful drinking. This session brought together key stakeholders in the health & safety, transport, and hospitality sectors to discuss responsible drinking with the theme: Enhancing the Social Consciousness around Responsible Beverage Service: A Collective Responsibility of Stakeholders. The event which held in Lagos was used to launch the Responsible Beverage Service in Nigeria with eminent stakeholders and representatives from the Federal, and State Ministries of Health, Federal Road Safety Commission, Nigerian Medical Association, Hospitality and Tourism Management Association of Nigeria, Lagos State Traffic Management Agency (LASTMA), Lagos State Ministry of Tourism and Hospitality, Lagos State Ministry of Transportation, and the Lagos State Safety Commission in attendance. Responsible Beverage Service (RBS) is a first of its kind intervention programme in Nigeria with the objective of contributing to the reduction of alcohol-related harms caused by drunk driving, underage drinking, binge drinking, gender-based violence and alcohol consumption by pregnant women. A key component of the RBS program will be the training of owners and managers of bars and alcohol sales outlets, alcohol service staff, and event centre managers. Community champions and health workers will also be trained in the provision of alcohol health literacy to pregnant women. Hugo Rocha, Managing Director, International Breweries Plc, in his welcome address, said: “Since 2018, Smart Drinking has, more and more, become part of our DNA and we continue to strive to bring that culture to our communities. Our commitment extends far beyond saying “drink responsibly”: it spans our Global Smart Drinking Goals, the work of the AB InBev Foundation, the commitments of our brands, and the behaviours that we ask our consumers to practice every time they pick up a beer.”
