A young Liverpool player, who only signed a contract to join the Reds this month, has suffered an early injury set-back. Ben Doak made the move from Celtic to Anfield barely a week ago, after announcing on social media that he had agreed to join the Merseyside giants in a deal understood to be worth around £600,000 to the Hoops. But the 16-year-old has been hit by a groin issue which has ruined the versatile youngster’s forthcoming international plans. Doak was set jet off to Israel to represent Scotland in the UEFA Under-17 Championship Finals, but an injury sustained on the eve of the competition has scuppered his plans and Brian McLaughlin’s team will now travel to the tournament without the Anfield teenager. Doak made two substitute appearances for Celtic’s first team, including against old firm rivals Rangers, before earning his big move to Liverpool. An exciting prospect, he can operate as either a midfielder or full-back. After impressing at youth level for his parent club, Doak received strong interest from a number of top clubs before Jurgen Klopp convinced him to join the Reds.
