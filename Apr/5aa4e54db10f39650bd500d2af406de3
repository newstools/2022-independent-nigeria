A commentator has taken the opportunity to mock Manchester United and Cristiano Ronaldo while lauding Lionel Messi’s performance for Paris Saint-Germain on Saturday. The Argentinian forward scored an incredible goal to give his side the lead against Lens in Ligue 1. Corentin Jean equalised late on for the visitors but it wasn’t enough to stop PSG from claiming the French title. An excited commentator in America couldn’t resist taking a dig at Ronaldo after Messi’s stunning finish as he watched on. He said: “Ronaldo of Manchester United are confirmed to be Conference League team in sixth or seventh place.” He then laughed: “The GOAT Messi scores really the goal that gets the title for PSG.” While United’s chances of reaching the Champions League now look slim, a place in the Europa League looks far more likely than the Europa Conference League. United are four points behind fifth-placed Tottenham after they could only draw at Brentford. Despite defeat for his side against Arsenal, Ronaldo managed to get on the scoresheet once again to drag United back into the game.
