Following APC’s announcement on the price of the nomination and interest forms, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), has called on the security agencies to immediately commence an investigation. In a statement by PDP national chairman Iyorchia Ayu, signed by his communications secretary, Simon Imobo-Tswam, the party said, “This is a confusing and unsympathetic act by the ruling party. Those who buy the N100 million and N50 million nomination forms should be investigated for fraud.’’ Meanwhile, the PDP has set its presidential form price at N40 million, and so far, 17 candidates have declared their intention to run.
