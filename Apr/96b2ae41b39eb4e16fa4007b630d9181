The Governor of Kogi State, Yahaya Bello has revealed why he wants to become the next President of Nigeria in the 2023 general election. Governor Bello who made this known on Saturday had earlier officially declared his intention to run for President on the platform of the All Progressives Congress (APC) to restore the hope of Nigerians. Speaking at Eagles Square in Abuja, Bello promised to build on the legacy of President Muhammadu Buhari by creating 20 millionaires in the country by 2030. According to him, each of the 20 millionaires would empower five other Nigerians and he would guarantee security, unity and progress. The governor also promised to replicate some of his achievements in Kogi State across Nigeria if elected president. The Presidential aspirant recalled how reports claimed that over 100 million Nigerians lived in extreme poverty during the administration of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), noting that the Buhari-led administration reduced the figure to 70 million. He said, “I am running for president because I see a bright light shining at the end of the tunnel for our nation. I am not one of those who always see doom. What God has helped us to do in Kogi state, by the grace of God we will replicate the same in Nigeria. “We are so blessed as a nation and yet it does not always seem so. I am running to restore hope by providing guarantees for security, unity and progress to all Nigerians. POLL “Our focus will be proper management of our great diversities so that it can really be an advantage. We will foster more cooperation and integration amongst citizens and make sure that progress is made steadily across all sectors and indicators.”
