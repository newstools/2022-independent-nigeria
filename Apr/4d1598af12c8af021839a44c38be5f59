The Nigerian Council of Registered Insurance Brokers (NCRIB) has condoled with the victims of the deadly attack on unsuspecting passengers of the Nigerian Railway Corporation Train facility from Abuja connecting a regional hub in the North. In a condolence letter to Rotimi Amaechi, the Honourable Minister of Transportation, Mr. Rotimi Edu, ,the President of the Council, noted that the council identified with the Federal Government and the immediate family members of the victims, at this moment of grief. Edu described the attack on the Kaduna bound train with over 900 passengers as unwarranted and hand work of cowards and urged the Federal Government to ensure that the perpetrators of the dastardly act were fished out and made to face the wrath of law to serve as deterrent to others who may have such devilish mind. Mr. Edu noted that the increasing cases of attack and insecurity in Nigeria constituted a huge challenge to government, foreign investors and other stakeholders and urged all the Services Chiefs to ensure a better synergy to adequately secure lives and properties of Nigerians. In spite of the strident efforts of the Federal Government through its various dedicated agencies, especially, Ministry of Transportation to build enduring legacies of massive infrastructural development, he said the incidences of gunmen attack and other vices of insecurity remain a blemish that could plunge the nation back into stone ages of poor infrastructure While commending the Kaduna State Government’s directives to bear the cost of treatment of the victims, Mr. Edu seized the opportunity to underscore the need for insurance. He specifically highlighted the crucial roles of Insurance Brokers who he noted were professional intermediaries in the insurance value chain and have the duty to advise clients about what to insure, how to insure and how to pursue their claims in the event of losses.
