ONITSHA – The Anambra State chairman, Pentecostal Fellowship of Nigeria (PFN), Bishop Moses Ezedebego, has warned Nigerians not to be carried away by the antics of some Northern elders under the platform, Northern Elders Forum (NEF), calling for the resignation of President Muhammadu Buhari. The group had few days ago called for the president’s resignation over worsening insecurity in the country which had taken a toll on the economic and social life of citizens, even as several lives had been lost to banditry and acts of terrorism. Bishop Ezedebego in his Easter message to Nigerians warned the citizens not to take the Northern elders call serious, stressing that it was meant to distract Nigerians who feel disappointed at Buhari’s performance. The PFN boss, who expressed sadness over the state of insecurity and economic downturn, wondered why the northern elders had been distancing themselves from the president when he (Buhari) was about to leave office. He explained that the call was suspicious as the north might be hatching a grand plan to plant another Fulani man from any political party to replace Buhari.
