AWKA – The Chairman of Anambra State House of Assembly Committee on Finance and Appropriation Hon. Obinna Chris Emeneka has observed that Governor Charles Soludo will realise a better state with the choice of new commissioners confirmed by the legislature. Emeneka who made the observation shortly after the confirmation of the list of commissioner nominees by the State Assembly explained that the Screening Committee thoroughly drilled the nominees and found them worthy of handling the responsibilities and obligations of their respective offices. Emeneka also explained that the legislature has fulfilled one of her constitutional roles by confirming the commissioner designates that were properly screened by the House of Assembly Committee on Screening and Election Matters. He, therefore, stated that the citizenry is hopeful that the governor will swear the commissioners in as announced by the Chief of Staff because the Anambra people earnestly await the transformations coming with Soludo’s government. The lawmaker who also stressed the need for a transparent and realistic budget, tasked the new commissioner for Budget and Economic Planning to ensure that items were clearly specified in the budget to guarantee verifiable results in implementation and executions. Emeneka also pointed out that from the credentials of the new commissioners and what were identified during the screening exercise, the people expect a liveable and prosperous Anambra with the constitution of the governor’s cabinet members.
