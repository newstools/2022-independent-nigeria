Umuahia – Former Abia State Commissioner for Local Government and Chieftaincy Affairs, Charles Ogbonna, has revealed that the emergence of the governorship candidate for the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) does not rest on Governor Okezie Ikpeazu rather, on all stakeholders of the party. Ogbonna, who is a founding member of PDP in the state, while fielding questions from newsmen in Umuahia on Tuesday, said the alleged plot by Governor Ikpeazu to mastermind the emergence of the party’s governorship candidate would be resisted by stakeholders of the party. “PDP does not belong to one person, it belongs to all of us, it’s not Okezie Ikpeazu’s PDP. “It is only when the process is right to produce a governor that you will be sure to have all hands on deck and make sure to win the election. But if you decide to alienate some people, you don’t listen to anybody, you have the power to put in anybody and produce a governorship candidate; it is simple, go ahead and do it, we will shoot you down by frustrating such an attempt,” he disclosed. The former member of the State Executive Council further alleged, “He wants to hand over to his kinsmen so that they can protect him, those things cannot happen”. “People are not Happy not because of the Zoning but because of Infrastructural Development of the State”, he said. According to him, he is not a lone voice against the choice of Governor Ikpeazu to anoint a candidate for the party even as the former Senate President, Senator Adolf Wabara and former Chairman of Niger Delta Development Commission, Onyema Ugochukwu, as well as other major stakeholders opposed the move to deny Abia North to produce the successor to Governor Ikpeazu in 2023. POLL He described those currently paying solidarity visits to the governor as political jobbers, “In the whole of Abia- North there is no single project the governor and government of PDP have been able to do in that Zone”.
