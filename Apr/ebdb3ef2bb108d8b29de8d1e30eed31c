NNEWI – Shortage of food items has hit Anambra State, causing price of commodities to skyrocket. Sources said that there was shortage of some food items in the state which included certain species of grains like beans, cassava powder (garri), tubers like yams, potatoes and cocoyam. Brown rice, sweet beans, irish potatoes, red coco-yams were said to have disappeared completely from markets in Anambra State forcing the price of white cocoyam, grains and tubers like sweet potato, brown beans to increase beyond the reach of the common man. Meat such as beef, pork, and mutton was scarce as cows were prohibited from entering the South East from the Northern parts of the country. Price of 10 lb of beef which sold for N1,500 last week now goes for N3,500 and N5000 in some parts of the state. Price of chicken has also increased from n2,000 to n7,000 depending on size and weight. The price increase has consequently affected other commodities making them scarce and hard to afford. Traders within Nnewi, Ozubulu , Awka, Ekwulobia , Ihiala, Awka- Etiti who spoke to Daily Independent , Thursday attributed the lack and shortage of food items to terrorist activities in the country who attack and harass farmers in various parts of the country from where the food items come. POLL On Thursday April 7 and Friday April 8 last week, some none-state actors in the guise of gunmen killed over one thousand cows in some parts of Anambra State, namely Igbo-Ukwu, Awka-Etiti and Awka, the state capital. “All this are the cause of high price of food items and disappearance of some commodities in Anambra. People are now afraid to go to market and to the farms. We hope that someday things would be better,” Okonkwo Igwe a grains dealer at Ekwulobia, lamented.
