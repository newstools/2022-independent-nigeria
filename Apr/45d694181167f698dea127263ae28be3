Kano State High Court on Tuesday sentenced the President of the Humanist Association of Nigeria, Mubarak Bala to 24 years imprisonment after pleading guilty to 18-count charges bordering on incitement and breach of public peace levelled against him. Bala, a renowned Kano-born atheist was arrested at his home in Kaduna on April 28, 2020, and taken to Kano, where complaints of blasphemy and incitement were lodged against him. The self-styled Atheist was said to have posted comments critical of Islam, Allah and Prophet Muhammad (SAW) on his verified Facebook timeline that triggered outrage among Muslims Umma. The Presiding Judge, Justice Farouk Lawan of Kano High Court 4, Audu Bako Secretariat, therefore, sentenced him to 24 years imprisonment after the accused person pleaded guilty to all the charges. There was however a mild drama when the judge asked him whether he knows the consequences of his guilty plea, Mr Bala insisted on not to change his initial plea. Mr Bala’s lawyer, James Ibor, had earlier tried to persuade his client to change his plea, but he insisted that he was guilty of charges. The lawyer however cited frustration and fear as reasons for his client’s guilty plea, saying his client had been in prison for two years. But Mr Bala, who appeared unruffled, raised his hand and told the court that he was guilty as charged. POLL In his plea of leniency, Mr Bala however said the intent of his social media posts was not to cause violence. He, therefore, promised not to repeat the blasphemous posts in future.
