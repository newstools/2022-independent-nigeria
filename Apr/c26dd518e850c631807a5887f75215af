LAGOS – The removal of Asisat Oshoala as the captain of the Super Falcons should not affect their performance at the African Women Cup of Nations coming up in Morocco in July. This is the position of former coach of the women national team, Godwin Izilien, while in a chat with our correspondent, noting that it remained the discretion of the coach to chose who should captain his team, explaining that changing a captain is always as a result of so many factors. Recall that since Coach Randy Waldrum stripped the FC Barcelona Ladies forward of the Super Falcons captainship, Nigerians have expressed mixed opinions on the rightness or wrongness of the decision with the women AFCON just about two months to go. However, Izilien, a very experienced manage who coached the team before, said there was no cause to worry. “It will not or should I say it should not affect them at the Cup of Nations. “Chosen a captain is the discretion of the coach and he can change his captain over so many factors. “He can change his captain because of indiscipline, poor performance and not been able to carry the team along because all other players look onto the captain. “He can change the captain because he wants greater commitment and may be he is not seeing or getting that from his present captain; in fact there are so many reasons a captain can be changed. POLL “One thing is sure; it will not affect the team because captains come and go but the team remains. The change should not affect the team because they are not playing for anybody but for the country,” the coach said. The nine times African champions qualified for the 2022 Women Cup of Nations in Morocco after overcoming their Ivorian counterparts 1-0 in Abidjan. The serial AFCON winners had earlier saw off the same team 2-0 in Nigeria.
