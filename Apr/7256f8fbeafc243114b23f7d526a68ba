Nigerian rapper and actor, Folarin Falana, popularly known as Falz, has revealed why he stopped featuring in the Nigerian actress, Funke Akindele’s soap opera titled, Jenifa’s Diary. According to the singer in an interview with Inkblot’s Meet & Greet, he stopped being on the show due to the schedule, and timing of shooting. He said, “If I could be on the show every single episode, I would but it’s just schedule, timing, shooting, ah! “People genuinely root for them (Jenifa and Sege). And there was a time that she had a bit of a confusion in her life as per which guy she should pick and everybody was like Sege! “Funke is able to build herself around characters that she’s working with and I have to say she’s one of the most, if not the most hardworking person I have come across in this entertainment industry. This woman, as we’re on set, she’s writing the next episode, she’s directing.” The singer further revealed his love for film making, expressing that he plans to make more films. “ I love filmmaking, that’s what I’ve come to realize. I really love the process of taking an idea and bringing it to life in the form of film. I really love that. So I think I’m definitely going to do a lot more. I don’t know the specifics. I can’t say for sure that I will go into directing. “I’m already a filmmaker with House 21. We’re creating films, we’re creating different other types of content. Now writing I think I probably would get into. That’s for sure. Ideas come to me already and with music, I already write music and it’s not the same, but having that kind of background, I think I’ll be able to write. But directing, you never know,” he said.
