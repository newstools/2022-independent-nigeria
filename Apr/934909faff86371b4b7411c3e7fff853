Manchester United have been urged to go all out and try lure Kylian Mbappe to Old Trafford. Mbappe is currently out of contract at the end of the season, and reports suggest his time at PSG is coming to an end. However, Mbappe looks destined for Real Madrid over the summer, but Emmanuel Petit has urged United to try their luck with the Frenchman. “He’s a leader at PSG. There are big talks [over his future] and big speculation – is he going to stay or is he going to leave? He recently said there have been new elements in his reflections, so maybe there is a third club after him,” Petit told Genting Casino. “There is speculation if it’s a club from England or Germany. It’s not Barcelona. So it’s Real Madrid, PSG and maybe it’s Bayern Munich, but do they have the money? “Is it the policy of Bayern Munich? Maybe there is a club in England? People are talking about Manchester City and Liverpool, but why not Manchester United? “I know Kylian is very linked to his town, the fans, family and friends, so it’s a huge decision for him. If PSG convince him to stay and he will be the centre of the new project, it could be enough to keep Mbappe, but it will be very difficult.” Mbappe and PSG were knocked out of the Champions League by Real Madrid in the Round of 16, and the Frenchman could leave in search of European success. However, United have some ground to make up if they are to offer Mbappe European football – with Ralf Rangnick’s side currently languishing in seventh.
