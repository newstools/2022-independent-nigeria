Lagos – The Super Eagles 2023 Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) qualifying group would be tricky. This is the position of the team’s former defender, Kadiri Ikhana, while in a chat with our correspondent. The 1980 AFCON winner said much as everyone is saying the group would be easy for Nigeria, there was the need for the three times African champions to prepare adequately if they hope to qualify for the 2023 AFCON in Cote d’Ivoire. “The group looks good on paper but football is not always like that. Remember football is not what it used to be because there is urgency in every country now to play at the biggest stage, so I will ask that we prepare well. “The group is not that easy because we can remember the last time Sierra Leone visited here, they came back from the dead to draw us 4-4 and that should be a reason we should not leave anything for granted. “Ordinarily qualifying from the group should not be that difficult if football is played based on current form but gone are the days,” he said. Meanwhile, in the race to qualify for the 2023 AFCON to be played in Cote d’Ivoire, Nigeria is pooled in Group A where they will confront the trio of Sierra Leone, Guinea Bissau and Sao Tome & Principe. The two top teams will qualify for the AFCON, which is billed for January of 2023. Nigeria are three time winners of the competition even as they remain the only winners of the biannual championship in that group.
