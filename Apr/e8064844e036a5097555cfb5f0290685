The Secretary to the Government of the Federation, Boss Mustapha has tasked the National Agency for Science and Engineering Infrastructure (NASENI) to lead Nigeria in the popularisation of home-initiated and home-sustained industrial goods, machines, technologies, equipment and reverse engineering of key processes to achieve sustainable economic recovery of Nigeria. Mustapha gave the charge at the weekend while declaring open a three-day Retreat for Technical Board Members and Managing Directors of NASENI Development Institutes held at Royal Institute for Training & Human Capital Development, Zuma Rock Resort, Niger State. Mustapha, represented by the Permanent Secretary Cabinet Affairs Office, Mr James Sule, said “A home initiated industrialisation is not only key to achieving a sustainable economic recovery for Nigeria but also it is the secret of the Asian Tigers, the magic of Europe and the culture of the Americans” The SGF directed that discussions by participants at the retreat must further strengthen President Buhari’s agenda and developmental goals whose priority areas included good governance, building a thriving and sustainable economy; enhancing social inclusion, reducing poverty; enlarging agricultural output for food security and export, attaining energy sufficiency in power and petroleum products as well as expanding access to quality education, affordable healthcare and productivity of Nigerians. He reiterated that a lot is expected of NASENI by Nigerians, entrepreneurs, industries, and Small and Medium Enterprises operators, urging the Agency to chart a new path for Nigeria’s industrial revolution. On the theme of the retreat, “NASENI-The Vehicle for Nigeria’s industrialisation,” Mustapha said it resonated with the Federal Government’s efforts toward positioning Nigerians to benefit from the fourth industrial revolution. In his welcome address, Prof. Mohammed Haruna, Executive Vice Chairman of NASENI, said President Buhari had directed the full implementation of all statutory provisions of the establishment act of NASENI in line with global best practices for the Agency to compete favourably and deliver on its mandate of providing enabling environment for home initiated and the home sustained industrialisation of Nigeria. He noted that the mandate of the Agency was in the areas of capital goods research and development, adding that NASENI was established in the model and fashion of similar agencies in Indonesia, Malaysia, Brazil, Japan and Thailand. POLL Those similar organisations, he explained, were in the forefront of providing research and development works, leading to their inventions and innovations of new and emerging technologies resulting in their economic prosperity and stability.” He said, “These countries operate knowledge-based economies and as such, their sources of foreign exchange include advanced technologies such as passengers and military aircraft; autonomous vehicles; conventional and renewable energy products, among others.
