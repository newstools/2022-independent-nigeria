ABUJA – The Federal Capital Terri­tory (FCT) has hinted that malaria accounts for 70 per­cent of outpatient visits, 40 percent of admissions with a total 389,957 cases reported in the nation’s capital. Mandate Secretary, Health and Human Service Secre­tariat (HHSS), Dr. Abubakar Tafida, stated that the ma­laria prevalence rate is 35.4 percent. Tafida gave this hint on Wednesday during a stake­holders’ interactive forum organised by the Secretariat as part of activities to mark the 2022 World Malaria Day, with the theme: “Harness innovation to reduce malar­ia disease burden and save lives”, in Abuja. He stated that this year’s theme is apt, as it is a clarion call by the World Health Or­ganisation (WHO) for new in­vestments and innovation to speed up the pace of efforts to control the malaria menace. His words, “Nigeria ac­counts for 32 percent of ma­laria related deaths, as the disease is responsible for 60 % of admissions, 11% of maternal mortality, 25% of infant mortality and 30 % of under-Five mortality. “The situation in the FCT is also critical. Stagnant waters, which are charac­teristics of the ever-enlarg­ing slums across the FCT, are the breeding ground for the Anopheles mosquitoes, whose bites cause malaria.” He revealed that the FCT Administration has stra­tegically and innovatively adopted a multi-pronged ap­proach towards reducing/ controlling the menace of the disease. He said, “We have free treatment and diagnostic testing of malaria cases in some selected primary health care facilities; free provision of malaria prophylaxis med­icine, sulfadoxine pyrimeth­amine for pregnant women.
