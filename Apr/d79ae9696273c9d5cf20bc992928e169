In line with the calls to stop plastic pollution, Lagos Apex Lions Club has partnered Ecorestoration Foun­dation Nigeria and Marine Research, to organise environmental coastal clean-up, medical and social outreach at Maruwa Beach, Lagos. Briefing journalists during the exercise, Lion Dr. Matilda Braimoh, President of Lagos Apex Lions Club, decried the unhealthy effects of pollution on the ecosystem by destroying its usefulness to human existence. Braimoh said healthy ecosystems cleanses the water, purifies the air, maintains soil, regulates the climate, recycles nutrients and provides hu­mans with food. She added that they provide raw materials and resources for medi­cines and other purposes. “They are at the foundation of all civilisation and sustain economies,” she said. The Lagos Apex Lions Club Presi­dent said that it is for this reason that her club is collaborating with Steph­anie Nzeke Waniko who works with the Nigerian Institute for Oceanog­raphy and Marine Research, Lagos, to promote the preservation of the ecosystem. She said Waniko, who is the Prin­cipal Research Officer and a trustee of Ecorestoration Foundation Nige­ria, shares similar vision with her club on preservation of ecosystems. She was optimistic about the suc­cess of the environmental coastal clean-up programme which included medical outreach, feeding and distri­bution of gifts to people on the beach.
