The General Overseer of the Omega Fire Ministries International, Apostle Johnson Suleman has warned married men against assaulting their wives, expressing that anyone caught would be beaten by brothers in church before being taken to the police station. The cleric disclosed this while addressing the congregation on assault, following the death of gospel music musician, Osinachi Nwachukwu, who allegedly died in hands of her abusive partner. He said, “When I once said there are certain marriages that should break, there was nothing they didn’t say about me. That’s why I kept quiet now, or did you hear me say anything? “But that’s what everyone is saying now. Somebody reached out to me, saying, ‘when you said it years ago they insulted you.’ “All those women that their husbands are beating, don’t they have brothers? If they don’t have biological brothers, they have Christian brothers. “If you are in this church and you are beating your wife, stop it. If she reports you to me, we will beat you. “I will go to the police station and take permission before I gather brothers in this church to beat you.”
