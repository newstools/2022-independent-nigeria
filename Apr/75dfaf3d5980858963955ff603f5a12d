At least 22 persons have been abducted in Jere, a town along the famous Abuja – Kaduna highway barely 24 hours after the visit of the Inspector General of Police, Usman Alkali Baba. Witnesses said 22 villagers were abducted by bandits from Unguwar Ma’aji in Jere town Sunday night. Jere shares a boundary with Tafa-Sabon Wuse in Niger State, and is located on the ever-busy Abuja-Kaduna Highway. A resident of Unguw Ma’aji, Shehu Bala, said the latest abduction took place about 11p.m on Sunday, adding that the bandits came in large numbers, invaded some houses and whisked away 22 residents, including five women. He said some of the bandits wore army uniforms. Bala said, “They moved from house to house and woke their victims up before they marched them into the bush at gunpoint.” He said the bandits operated silently in the community for over an hour, adding that they only started shooting sporadically to scare people from coming after them after leaving the community. Bala, however, said one among the 22 kidnapped victims escaped from his abductors while being led into the bush. There was no immediate comment from the spokesperson of the Kaduna State Police Command, ASP Mohammed Jalinge.
