The Leader of the INRI Evangelical Spiritual Church, Primate Elijah Ayodele has revealed what God told him about Governor Dapo Abidoun while releasing a fresh prophecy concerning the Ogun State 2023 gubernatorial election. Primate Ayodele who made this known in a statement signed by his Media Aide, Osho Oluwatosin revealed that Governor Abiodun will have a second term, although it will not be rosy. According to him, the challenges Abiodun will face are within his party, the All Progressives Congress (APC) and that there is no serious person in the camp of former governor Ibikunle Amosun that can take the seat away from him. Speaking further, he noted that Governor Abiodun has not done well especially in terms of infrastructure, insecurity and payment of pensions while advising him to work on them to have a rosy second term. He said, “In Ogun State, I don’t see any serious person that can take it from Governor Dapo Abiodun though he has not done very well in terms of infrastructure, insecurity and payment of pension. ‘’There will be serious rancor within the party that will shake his second term ambition, the only challenge he will face is within his party, He should do a lot of reconciliations to get his second term ticket. ‘’If he wants his second term to be rosy, he should work on the aforementioned areas where he is lacking but he will still retain the seat regardless of the ups and down.’’ The Man of God, however, advised some candidates of the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) namely Segun Sowunmi, Ladi Adebutu and Jimi Lawal not to waste their money because Abiodun will retain the seat. POLL ‘’In PDP, Segun Sowunmi, Ladi Adebutu, and Jimi Lawal won’t go anywhere, let them not waste their money, they should use it for charity. “For now, if there’s election in Ogun State, Dapo Abiodun will still retain the seat,” he said.
