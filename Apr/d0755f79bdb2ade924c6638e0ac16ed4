Everton boss Frank Lampard says fellow relegation battlers Burnley’s decision to sack Sean Dyche “doesn’t affect” the Toffees. Dyche was axed last Friday by the Clarets, who subsequently drew 1-1 at West Ham on Sunday with Mike Jackson in caretaker charge. With seven matches to play, Burnley are 18th in the Premier League, three points adrift of 17th-placed Everton, who have a game in hand. Lampard’s side were beaten 3-2 at Turf Moor on April 6 then defeated Manchester United 1-0 at Goodison Park three days later, before Burnley lost 2-0 at Norwich the next day in what proved the final game of Dyche’s tenure. Everton return to action by hosting Leicester on Wednesday, with the Clarets then entertaining Southampton 24 hours later. When asked at his pre-match press conference about Dyche’s sacking, Lampard said: “Firstly, Sean Dyche has been an incredible manager of the club. I think that’s been quite a universal reaction to it. “But the club have decided to make a change, and Sean Dyche I’m sure deserves maybe a bit of a rest and then will get a fantastic job because of the level of manager he has shown himself to be. “I wish Sean all the best going forward on that. In terms of what happens to Burnley, what it means in this period, nobody knows. POLL “You can probably go through history and find good reactions from changes, not so good reactions from changes. “It doesn’t affect Everton. I saw a quote this week saying we were let off the hook that it’s happened. I don’t see how. “This doesn’t change anything – Burnley are a good team and used to fighting to stay in the Premier League, and that fact will remain the same.”
