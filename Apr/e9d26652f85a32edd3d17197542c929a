The Governor of Rivers State and presidential aspirant on the platform of the People’s Democratic Party (PDP), Nyesom Wike has faulted the consensus move by former Senate President Bukola Saraki, Governor Aminu Tambuwal of Sokoto State amongst others. Governor Wike who spoke with some delegates and members of the party in Calabar, Cross River State on Wednesday described the move as rubbish, deceptive and fake news used in deceiving PDP members. The governor, however, said that consensus could only happen through equity, justice, and fairness while recalling telling Saraki that he would not support a consensus arraignment in PDP. He said, “I am not here for any consensus rubbish. I have told people not to deceive our party members with fake news about consensus. We all believe in consensus, but it must come with equity, justice, and fairness. “When some of my colleagues led by the former Senate President came to me, I told them I would not fall into the consensus trap. If you want to run for election, please run, and if you are not ready, please go home. “They want somebody who would come and bow down for them. But what the country needs now is fearless and courageous somebody.” The likes of former Senate President, Bukola Saraki, Presidential aspirant, Atiku Abubakar and some other aspirants have been clamouring for a consensus Presidential candidate for the PDP.
