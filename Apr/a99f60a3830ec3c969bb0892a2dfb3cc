LAGOS – A member of the Federal House of Representatives, Hon. Yusuf Ayinla on Thursday said that the achievements of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) will make the party remain in power beyond 2023. Ayinla, who said that Nigerians have seen the difference between the APC and PDP, maintained that “Nigerians will never give PDP another chance to return to power. They were there for 16 years and they had nothing tangible to show for those years. “In just eight years of the APC, we have been able to resuscitate our railways, many of the highways that were in a very poor state, have been reconstructed,” he stated. The lawmaker in an interview with our correspondent, however, noted that there are still some challenges confronting the nation but that the challenges are surmountable as long as APC continues to govern the country. “We are still facing some challenges and I believe that these challenges are surmountable. Wherever we find ourselves today, it is as a result of the 16 years of misrule of the PDP. The APC is gradually taking the nation out of all these problems and with time, we will get out of all of them. “For us to get to that promised land, Nigerians must continue to support the APC and ensure that they elect a leader that is capable of getting us to that promised land. “We need a leader like Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu to lead Nigeria to the desired destination where we will be able to compete with some of the developed nations. “Asiwaju has done it before when he was Lagos State governor when he raised the IGR of the state from just N600 million to N30 billion monthly without inflicting additional hardship or tax burden on the people. POLL “So he is the kind of leader we need to solve those challenges still confronting and I am sure that once Asiwaju becomes the next president of Nigeria, the citizens won’t elect any other party to govern the country,” Ayinla added.
