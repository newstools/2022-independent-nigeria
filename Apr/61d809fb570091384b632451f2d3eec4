The Osun State Government has appealed to the angry youths in Ile Ife protesting the death of a suspect in police custody. The protest was sparked by the sudden death of one Femi Oriyomi who was arrested by policemen in connection with ritual killing along with two others presently undergoing interrogations with the police. During the melee, one person was shot dead while the police were drafted to quell the protest resulting from the incident. But Osun State Government in a statement issued by Commissioner for Information and Civic Orientation, Funke Egbemode said that the violence has come to its notice urging the youths against taking laws into their hands. The statement said, “the violence sparked off by the face-off between the men of Nigerian Police Force and the youths of Iloro area of Ile-Ife, has come to the notice of the government of Osun State, and it is using this opportunity to appeal to the youths and residents of the town to give peace a chance. The government has ordered an immediate investigation into the remote and immediate causes of the violence, especially the alleged death of a detained suspect and the shooting by men of the Nigerian Police at unarmed youths. In the meantime, residents of the area are urged not to take laws into their hands by hurting more people or destroying properties. We implore our citizens to embrace peace and shun violence, in the spirit of this solemn season.
