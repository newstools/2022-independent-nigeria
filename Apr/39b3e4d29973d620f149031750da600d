ABUJA – The National Agricultural Land Development Authority (NALDA) has begun the distribution of 500 pumping machines to farmers in Katsina State to boost irrigation farming. Prince Paul Ikonne, Executive Secretary of NALDA, flagged off the distribution of 500 pumping machines at the Authority’s Integrated Farm Estate in Suduje, Daura Local Government Area of the State. Addressing the beneficiaries of the Federal Government’s gesture, Ikonne charged them to use the machines to boost their irrigation activities, warning them to desist from selling the machines. He said: “These machines are not for you to sell, no. They are  for you to use and grow your farms and earn more income for yourselves and your family.” One of the beneficiaries, a retired Technical College Teacher, turned farmer, Abashe Ali Daura, who engages in both wet season and dry season farming, said the pumping machines would go a long way in improving and expanding his farm. “I demarcated some parts of my farmland for irrigation purposes. This machine will contribute a lot to the improvement of my irrigation farming where I farm vegetables and fruits like guava and I thank the Federal Government for this support.” A female beneficiary, Mrs Murja Ahmed, a vegetable farmer, who spoke in the Hausa language, said she was overwhelmed by the gesture as it would go a long way in boosting her income generation. “Allihamdullahi, we thank the Almighty God for these machines the government has given us. They will really help us in supporting our children in their education and other things. POLL “And by God’s grace with the aid of this machine, I would be more committed and put in more efforts in the dry season farming,” she said.
