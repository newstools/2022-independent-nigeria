Spanish broadcaster Gol will show next week’s La Liga game between Real Sociedad and Real Betis live on TikTok — in a first for the Spanish league. The game will be shown in vertical format, in 9:6 dimensions, and in 4k. Gol says it is the first football match both in Spain and in a major European league to be broadcast in this way. There will be over 30 people working on the production at San Sebastian, with Spanish company Mediapro using a “special device” to capture the 4k footage. The fixture, which kicks off at 8pm BST, will also be available as normal on Gol’s regular TV channel. La Liga’s director of digital strategy, Alfredo Bermejo, said: “This is one more step for La Liga in the quest to build new audiences and bring football to all viewers. “This agreement with TikTok confirms the work that La Liga and MEDIAPRO have been carrying out in recent seasons, to continue creating value and innovating in the broadcasting of matches.”
