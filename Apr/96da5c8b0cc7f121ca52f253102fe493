LAGOS – MTN Nigeria and Pan-Atlantic University (PAU) Wednesday launched the MTN Media Innovation Programme (MTN MIP), which would be run by PAU’s School of Media and Communication (SMC). The six-month, fully funded fellowship for Nigerian media practitioners is designed to support the sustainable development of the nation’s changing media scene. It is open to media practitioners across the spectrum, including print, electronic, online platforms and social media content creators. The course is designed to give participants a greater understanding of Nigeria’s technology sector and the nexus between media and technology; it will also leave participants better able to adapt to changing realities. Fellows will also have access to professional resources and mentorship from the SMC faculty.
