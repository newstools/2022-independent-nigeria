Justice Inyang Ekwo of the Federal High Court sitting in Abuja has ordered the Chairman, Code of Conduct Tribunal (CCT), Danladi Umar to appear before the Senate and face his probe over alleged public misconduct. Umar was alleged to have publicly assaulted one Sargwak, a security guard at Banex Plaza in Wuse 2, Abuja, in March 2021, following a disagreement that ensued between them over a parking lot on the premises. Following public outcry and a petition, the Senate invited the CCT Chairman to question him on what had transpired between him and the private security guard. But in a bid to evade Senate’s probe, Danladi Umar hurriedly headed to court to stop his invitation by the Senate. In a judgement on Tuesday, the court held that as a public officer administering law, he is answerable to the Senate on moral standards and conduct. Justice Ekwo stated that Umar’s suit seeking to stop his probe by the Senate lacked merit and was consequently dismissed the same.
