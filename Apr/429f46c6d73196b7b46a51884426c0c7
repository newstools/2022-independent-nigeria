The Nigerian Army has said that its troops of the 34 Artillery Brigade, have neutralised a member of the proscribed Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) at Ihioma community, Orlu Local Government Area of Imo State. In a release signed by the Director, Army Public Relations, Brig.-Gen. Onyema Nwachukwu, the troops on routine patrol encountered members of the separatist group who fired sporadically at them at Banana Junction, in Orlu LGA. According to him, “the IPOB was enforcing the illegal sit-at-home order on law-abiding citizens going about their legitimate businesses when they encountered the soldiers.” He added that the group, on sighting the troops, withdrew in a blue Toyota Highlander towards Ihioma Community for reinforcement. “In the firefight that ensued during the operation, one of the criminals was taken out, while others fled in disarray. “Troops are combing the general area in a follow-up operations to track down the fleeing dissidents,” he said. “Having suffered casualty and effectively denied freedom of action by the troops, the irredentist group have resorted to cheap propaganda to whip up public sentiments by circulating a doctored video on the social media alleging troops complicity in their mindless atrocities. “This propaganda should be disregarded in its entirety,” he added.
