Savannah Energy PLC, the Brit­ish independent energy com­pany focused on the delivery of projects that matter in Africa, has announced that Accugas Limited (Accugas), the company’s 80 per­cent indirectly owned subsidiary, has signed an addendum to its existing interruptible gas sales agreement (IGSA) with the First Independent Power Limited (FIPL), originally signed on 28 January 2020. Accugas currently supplies up to 35 MMscfpd of gas to FIPL’s Afam power plant. Under the terms of the addendum, FIPL will be able to increase the quan­tity of gas purchased from Accu­gas to up to 65 MMscfpd so as to also supply the Trans Amadi and Eleme power plants, in addition to its Afam power plant. FIPL’s power plants have a total generation capacity of 391 MW, with the Trans Amadi and Eleme plants having generation capacities of 136MW and 75 MW, respectively. All three plants are located in Rivers State. FIPL is an affiliate company of the Sahara Group, a leading in­ternational energy and infrastruc­ture conglomerate with operations in over 42 countries across Africa, the Middle East, Europe and Asia. Andrew Knott, CEO of Savan­nah Energy, said “Accugas has re­corded growth in total revenues from gas sales for each of the last five years, with a realised CAGR of 15 per cent.”
