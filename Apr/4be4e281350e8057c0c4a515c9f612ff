Liverpool haven’t given up hope of Roberto Firmino being available for Sunday’s Merseyside derby against Everton. Firmino was absent from Tuesday’s 4-0 Premier League demolition of Manchester United having suffered a foot injury during the closing moments of Saturday’s FA Cup semi-final win over Manchester City at Wembley. The Brazilian, who netted twice in the Champions League draw with Benfica last week, underwent a scan that revealed there was no serious damage. And Jurgen Klopp will now wait on the fitness of the forward before finalising plans for the 240th derby this weekend. “Bobby was not involved (against United) because in the very last situation of the City game he got something on his foot,” said Klopp. “It’s not really bad. “Will he be fit for Everton? We hope so. Actually, we were a bit worried but the scan was fine. But it’s still very painful and that’s why there was no chance (of playing on Tuesday).” Liverpool were given a day off on Wednesday after a run of six games in 18 days following the international break. They will return to Kirkby on Thursday to being preparations for the weekend visit of Everton.
