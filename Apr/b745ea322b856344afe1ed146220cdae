French President Emmanuel Macron had to be whisked away by security Wednesday after he was attacked with cherry tomatoes on his first outing since his election victory on Sunday. Macron was talking to a small crowd at a market in Cergy, a northwestern suburb of Paris, when someone in the crowd threw a handful of cherry tomatoes in his direction. The tomatoes hit a passer-by and did not connect with the president, but led to shouts from the crowd and his security guard to yell “projectile,” before opening an umbrella to protect Macron from further attack. He was then escorted away from the scene. Macron said he was visiting Cergy, an area of around 65,000 people situated around 30 kilometers from the center of Paris, to show his commitment to listen to and govern all French people, no matter who they had voted for. Almost half — 48 percent — of the suburb’s voters opted for far-left candidate Jean-Luc Mélenchon in the first round of the presidential election on April 10, with Macron trailing far behind, with just 23.7 percent. “I have come to say that I have heard the voices of each and everyone, and that I will continue to be engaged with the neighborhoods that are most in difficulty … every day,” Macron said, before the incident took place.
