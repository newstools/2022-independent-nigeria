Lagos – As the nation awaits the announcement of a new Super Eagles coach after several names have been shortlisted and spoken to, Friday Ekpo has charged the Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) to go for a coach that can instill discipline in the players. The former midfielder of the team, who was part of the 1992 Africa Cup of Nations in Senegal where Nigeria finished third, said that it was obvious that lack of discipline also accounted to why the national team, filled to the brim with quality players, has continued to under perform even when they are expected to do better. Recall that the poor display of the Super Eagles got to a head after they failed to qualify for the 2022 World Cup in Qatar, with accusing fingers pointed to members of the team, who majority of Nigerians saw as never serious with the two legged games against the Black Stars of Ghana. Ekpo, in an interview said that the coach the team needs now was one that would maintain decorum in the team and return the glory days. “Super Eagles do not need just any coach but one that will ensure discipline in the team and make sure they give their best whenever they are called upon. “Matches we have played recently shows that the players at times don play their hearts out and that has a lot to do with the kind of coach that is managing them. “We need a coach that will control the players and ensure peace in the dressing room because that is where indiscipline starts. “So they (NFF) should go after such a coach because we have quality players that can do the job whenever they want to give their best,” he said.
