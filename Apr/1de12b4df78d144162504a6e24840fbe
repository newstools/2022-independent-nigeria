At least one inmate died, while 12 others were injured, during a fight that snowballed into an attempted jailbreak at the Port Harcourt Correctional Centre on Monday. It was gathered that two inmates were engaged in a fight, which led to the death of one of them, even as a protest ensued amongst other inmates. The situation spiraled as many inmates tried to scale the facility’s high walls, but were repelled by a combined team of security operatives who shot outside the fence, with 12 of them sustaining serious injuries. Spokesperson of the Port Harcourt Correctional Centre, Juliet Ofoni, confirmed the incident
