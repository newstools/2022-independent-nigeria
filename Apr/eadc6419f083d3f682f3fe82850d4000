The People’s Democratic Party (PDP) standard-bearer for the June 18, 2022 Governorship poll in Ekiti State, Honourable Bisi Kolawole, has dismissed the seeming rising political profile of the Social Democratic Party (SDP) gubernatorial candidate, Engineer Segun Oni, as a potential threat to his (Kolawole) ambition stressing that “Third Force” has a history of electoral humiliation in Ekiti. Kolawole, who maintained this position while interacting with journalists in Ado-Ekiti urged his supporters not to be disturbed by the alleged over-bloated political credentials of some office-seekers in Ekiti. Going down the memory lane, the PDP candidate said: “Third Force has never had any significant impact in the governorship election. “Yinka Akerele tried it ANPP in 2007, but he failed. Michael Opeyemi Bamidele tried it under Labour Party in 2014, but he failed. Even my principal attempted it under Labour Party in 2011 and he had a nasty experience. “The truth of the matter is that no true PDP member would defect to another political. Those following Oni are those who came with him from APC. Let me tell you, the PDP is intact in Ekiti and we are taking over government in Ekiti 2022 by God’s grace. “So, I am not rattled by Segun Oni’s Social Democratic Party. The Third force had never made any remarkable difference in the Ekiti election as reflected in the elections of 2007, 2011 and 2014. “Oni moving from one party to the other for him to be governor could best portray him as mere political normal.” Outlining his programme, Kolawole said his government would re-engage the sacked workers laid off by Fayemi, while also creating an enabling environment for youth to venture into the farming business.
