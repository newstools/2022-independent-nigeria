The Nigerian Youth and Diaspora Forum For Bola Ahmed Tinubu (NYD4BAT) has praised the National Leader and Presidential hopeful of the All Progressive Congress (APC) for cancelling his 70th birthday event in honour of victims of the terrorist bombing in Kaduna. On March 29 over 60 Nigerians were reportedly killed by a bomb blast set against the Kaduna-Abuja train while passengers were on board. 970 passengers were aboard the train when it was attacked between Katari and Rijana communities. A statement signed by the Media Director of the NYD4BAT, Dr Ajibola Abayomi, praised Tinubu for demonstrating uncommon love for the victims of the incident by halting all the activities related to the birthday already ongoing at the Eko Hotel and Suite in Lagos. “While NYD4BAT sympathized with the families of the bereaved and wished the survivors quick recovery, we want to put it on record that “Aswaju Tinubu in his statement element demonstrated what leadership entails despite the billions of naira already invested in the colloquium that had on seat top dignitaries both from Nigeria and abroad. “The manner Tinubu took everyone by storm when he mounted the podium to announce the cancellation of the event is a demonstration of genuine concern and total humanity that are lacking in our system which many occupiers of political offices today must learn from. With this spirit of heartfelt love for the victims, If he becomes the President, certainly he would run a government with a human face. “At this moment, the heart of the NYD4BAT is with the victims and we call on the federal government to ensure that every energy is channelled to ensure that terrorism is defeated in Nigeria” Dr Ajibola counselled.
