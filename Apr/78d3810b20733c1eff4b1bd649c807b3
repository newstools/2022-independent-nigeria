Katsina State Government has debunked the purported news report on Saturday that 34 citizens of Akwa Ibom State residing in Katsina were attacked, saying there was no such scenario in the state. Addressing a joint press conference held at the Government House Press Centre, the Director-General of New Media, Al_Amin Isah and the Special Adviser on Security Matters, Ibrahim Ahmad Katsina said that the essence is to clear the air and deny the claims which have already been in circulation across the state and the nation. In particular, the Special Adviser on Security drew the attention of the Akwa Ibom State Government and other State Governments that may fall victim to people that are trying to create tension and attract certain favours from their governments that the state never witnessed such a scenario. “The situation in Katsina State as confirmed by security agencies in the state and as all can attest to is stable, peaceful and government and other security agencies are on top of the situation”. “There was no single incident where some non-indigene were been attacked or subjected to the terror of banditry we are facing”. “Most of the problems the state is facing are community-based and everybody can attest to this”, he explained. ”We want to assure Nigerians and the international communities that Katsina State is safe and that peace has already been returning gradually. We want the Akwa Ibom State Government to be wary of that”, he noted. It would be recalled that, on Saturday, the Akwa Ibom State Government evacuated 34 of her citizens, who were stranded in Katsina State following alleged heightened banditry and insurgency in some parts of the state. POLL The victims, who arrived in their home state were received by the Commissioner for Women Affairs and Social Welfare, Dr Ini Adiakpan on behalf of the state government, at the Women Development Centre in Uyo.
