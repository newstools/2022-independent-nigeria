ILORIN – Two suspects caught with fresh head of young boy and a pair of hands have told police in Kwara State that the human parts were meant for an Alfa (religious scholar), based in Ilorin. SP Ajayi Okasanmi, the spokesman for the state Police Command, who disclosed this in a statement did not how­ever indicate whether they would bring the Alfa in for questioning. The suspects, Wasiu Omonose, male, aged 35, of Abioye Compound, Share, and Akanbi Ibrahim ‘male’ aged 32 of Sayo Street, Share, allegedly confessed that the human parts were meant for ritual purposes. The Police said their pa­trol team on Sunday, around 11 a.m. intercepted two men on a motorcycle. The suspects, according to police, attempted to evade the officers on stop and search duty, which aroused the suspicion of the police operatives. “The suspects were then given a hot chase and forced to a stop. In the process of searching them, a bag con­taining a fresh human head and hands were found in their possession,” Police said “For the umpteenth time, the Commissioner of Police Kwara State, CP Tuesday As­sayomo is warning criminal elements to relocate from Kwara State, as the Police Command would not fold its arms and allow criminals of whatever nomenclature to truncate the peace and har­mony currently existing in Kwara State,” the police said.
