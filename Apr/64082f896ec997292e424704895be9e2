The brother of former first lady Michelle Obama has filed a lawsuit after his young “model student” sons were dismissed from their university prep school following a dispute between his family and school administrators over teachers allegedly using inappropriate language in class. Craig Robinson and wife Kelly appeared on Good Morning America on Tuesday to discuss the lawsuit. According to their court filing, the school dismissed their 9-year-old and 11-year-old after the parents complained to the school about the inappropriate use of racially-charged language like the word “plantation” during classtime.
