In line with the mandate of Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu towards ensuring a cleaner environment, the Lagos Environmental Sanitation Corps (LAGESC), has admonished Lagosians to maintain a tidy environment and continue to obey the environmental laws of the State during and after the Easter break. Speaking recently on the Easter Celebrations at the Command Headquarters, Bolade-Oshodi, the Corps Marshal of the Agency, CP Gbemisola Akinpelu (rtd), said it is essential for Lagosians to keep their surroundings clean as more waste will be generated during the festivities, charging them to pack the waste appropriately for pick up by accredited PSP operators in their neighborhoods. The Corps Marshal warned street traders and hawkers displaying their wares for sale on the pedestrian bridges, road setbacks, lay-bys, medians and verges to desist from the illegal act as it contravenes the State Environmental Management Protection Law of Lagos State 2017 and impedes free vehicular as well as pedestrian movement. She further harped on the need for pedestrians to resort to the use of strategically-erected pedestrian bridges on highways across the State to avoid accidents, stressing that their safety is of high priority to the Lagos State Government. On the menace of commercial motorcyclists, dispatch riders, and uniformed men using the wheelchair ramps of pedestrian bridges to cross to the other side of the road, CP Akinpelu warned culprits to desist from such practices as the ramps are meant for People Living With Disabilities (PLWD). The Corps Marshal also lamented the unhygienic behavior of residents, who channel their waste into gutters, as well as those who refuse to empty their overflowing septic tanks, warning that residents involved in such environmental infractions across the State will soon be dealt with by the law. CP Akinpelu also urged Lagosians to be security-conscious at all times whilst maintaining a clean, hygienic, and habitable environment in their residential areas to stem the spread of diseases in Lagos.
