LAGOS  – Famfa Oil Limited, one of Nigeria’s leading indigenous oil exploration, and Production Company collaborated with Futurize to co-fund the launch of its first annual Fuel Africa Innovation Programme which was organised in partnership with AstraZeneca and Microsoft recently. The programme which was also co-funded by Bristol Myers Squibb, virtually brought together hundreds of students and recent alumni from twelve universities across seven countries in Sub-Saharan Africa for an entrepreneurship bootcamp and innovation competition. During the innovation competition, participants formed multi-disciplinary teams, received industry insights, mentorship, and hands-on training through workshops to generate solutions for early-stage business ventures. At the end, the teams pitched their ideas to a panel of judges and were awarded pre-seed investment through cash prizes and opportunities to advance their careers. Digital training is crucial to sustainable development, boosting entrepreneurship and job creation. “By bridging the gap between education and the current labor markets, entrepreneurship programmes like Fuel Africa can unlock the tremendous talent universities hold,” said Futurize CEO Rhea Singhla. Participants had opportunities to network with peers and international experts to create a collaborative ecosystem that can drive innovation to grow the African economy.
