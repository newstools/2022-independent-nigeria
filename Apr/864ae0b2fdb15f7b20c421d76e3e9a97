WARRI – The Director-General of the Sherification Movement, Palmer Ogheneyole Nathaniel has condemned in strong terms the rumours of possible disqualification of Speaker of the Delta State House of Assembly, Chief Sheriff Oborevwori on grounds of discrepancies in academic certificates, nothing that enemies of the state were at work as no such thing ever occurs during the screening of aspirants in Port-Harcourt. In a press statement on Friday evening, the Director General of The Sherification Movement, a political pressure group set up for the election of the Speaker as Delta State Governor, disclosed that nothing close to what is in the rumour mill ever happened as Oborevbori was cruising home to victory in preparation for the 2023 general polls. “It has come to our notice the news of the alleged disqualification of our principal Rt. Hon. Sheriff Oborevwori, from the Delta State gubernatorial race of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). “Ordinarily, a malicious, unfounded and evil hoax of that nature, concocted by enemies of the state who are shivering at the thought of having a new Sheriff in town, need not attract response from us, but for the sake of the reading public and Deltans especially our ever-cooperating delegates and patriotic citizens who may be swayed by these falsehoods, we deem it necessary to state the facts as they are.”
