Zulfa and the Plateau state Governor, Simon Lalong. Daily Independent reports that recently Barr Zulfa Bitrus Rimven had set up a committee to receive decampees. Speaking while receiving the decampees, Hon Zulfa who was accompanied by the Commissioner for housing Hon Brian Bintim Dadi and all the LGA APC aspirants for the forthcoming 2023 election, assured them of justice and fairness amongst members of the ruling party and called on others who are yet to join to do so. The council boss who described the event as a ‘harvest’ of over 1,502 members, expressed delight that most of the returnees are former leaders, ward excos and members of the people’s democratic party ( PDP).
