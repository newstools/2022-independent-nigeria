Following the report of one Chibuike Nwachukwu who accused Medville Global Health Center of being responsible for the death of his wife during childbirth, the Lagos State government has shut down the hospital located at Ago Palace way in Okota. The Executive Secretary of the Health Facility Monitoring and Accreditation Agency (HEFAMAA), Abiola Idowu, in a statement said preliminary investigations by the team disclosed that Medville hospital was not registered with HEFAMAA, and had inadequate personnel. Mr. Nawchukwu had claimed the hospital induced his wife to speed up labor but 10 hours after that, she had yet to give birth. He alleged that his wife died as a result of incompetence after a series of procedures were performed on her, adding that the baby is at the Intensive Care Unit of another hospital. HEFAMAA’s board chairman Solanke Koya has now ordered a full-scale investigation to uncover the facts surrounding the death of Nwachukwu’s wife.
