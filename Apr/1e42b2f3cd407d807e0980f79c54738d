Researchers are seeking to recruit 120 former professional footballers to help with a new study to investigate how to reduce the risk of dementia. The BrainHOPE study will be led by consultant neuropathologist Willie Stewart, whose previous research showed ex-professionals were three-and-a-half times more likely to die from neurodegenerative diseases than the general population. The new project, which will be jointly funded by the English Football Association (FA) and FIFA, will use a range of tests to compare brain health in former footballers between the ages of 40 and 59 with the general population, and explore whether there are ways to reduce the risk. “This is an incredibly important study, and we are grateful to the FA and FIFA for their support to allow it to proceed,” said Stewart, an honorary professor at the University of Glasgow. “Our findings from the Field study show there is reason to worry about lifelong brain health in former footballers. BrainHOPE is designed to identify tests that might detect problems early on and, more importantly, possible ways to try and reduce dementia risk for former footballers,” Mr Stewart added. Former Republic of Ireland manager Jack Charlton, and several of his teammates from England’s 1966 World Cup winning squad, were suffering from dementia at the time of their deaths. In 2002, an inquest recorded a verdict of death by industrial disease in the case of former West Brom striker Jeff Astle caused by repeated heading of the ball.
