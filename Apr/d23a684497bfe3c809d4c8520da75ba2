LAGOS – Chevron Nigeria Limited has expressed its commitment to continue to work with the Nigerian government towards the development of the oil and gas industry and the Nigerian economy generally. The company’s stance was sequel to recent report alleging that CNL is one of the partners hindering full operation of the Nigeria Liquefied Natural Gas (NLNG) by not allowing the transportation of third-party gas through its pipelines to increase gas supply to the plant. The company said the report was untrue. “CNL wishes to clarify that the statement must have been made in error as CNL is not one of the NLNG partners and is not part of the NLNG gas supplier system”, it said in a statement.
