A former Big Brother Naija Season Five housemate, Tolani Shobajo, popularly known as Tolanibaj, has lamented that Nigerians only love and accept celebrities with grass to grace story. The BBN Star disclosed this in a video while reacting to a blog post which tagged her as one of the worst dressed at Rita Dominic’s wedding. She said, “Because I am not your fave, someone is now paying a blog to put me on their worst dress list. “The moment I realized as a celebrity that if you are not homegrown, Nigerians are not going to accept you. Like if you don’t have a grass to grace story, poverty story, they are always going to treat you like an outsider.”
