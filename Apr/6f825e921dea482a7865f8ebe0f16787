Graeme Souness has slammed Manchester City’s decision to splash out on Jack Grealish for £100 million last August. City paid the British record transfer fee to sign Grealish from Aston Villa in August last year. Eyebrows were raised at the time because City were also keen to sign a world-class striker and wanted to bring in Harry Kane from Tottenham Hotspur. Grealish has had to adapt to life at Pep Guardiola’s City this season and has only managed five goals and three assists in 34 games this season. The boyhood Villa fan admitted in an interview earlier this month that he knows his output needs to improve. Last season he managed seven goals and a dozen assists in only 27 games with Grealish sidelined for the majority of the second half of the campaign through injury. “Obviously as an attacking player, you do want goals and assists. I know for one thing I should definitely have more assists,” Grealish told the BBC. “Goals – I think I need to get myself in goal scoring positions a little bit more but I know it’s not all about goals and assists. There are big games we’ve won and I feel like I’ve contributed.” Writing in his column for The Sunday Times, former Liverpool and Newcastle United manager Souness thinks City made the wrong call by signing Grealish. And he also thinks other clubs will be hit by the decision because of the knock-on effect the £100m fee will have in future transfer windows. “City got it wrong last summer by signing Grealish from Villa,” he said. “To commit £100m on an area that didn’t need strengthening – they already had Raheem Sterling, Bernardo Silva, Riyad Mahrez and Phil Foden – was a mistake. You can’t say Grealish has made a difference. “The Grealish fee also sets a precedent if City come calling for a player. “If you’re selling, you would always ask for more than you value the player at because you know clubs like City, and Newcastle United now, have deep wallets.”
