He said: “I am using this medium to sincerely appreciate the Honourable Speaker of the House of Representative, Rt Hon Femi Gbajabiamila for his unflinching efforts in ensuring the dividends of democracy gets to the youths and people in Surulere and beyond. “Mr Speaker’s striving is too obvious to even the blind. No area is left untouched in the aspect of facilitating infrastructure projects such as road construction, the building of ICT centres in schools, construction of schools and equipping schools with needed equipment; provision of healthcare facilities; series of leadership and empowerment programmes for youths within and outside the constituency; just to mention but a few.” Laguda, who sued for continued peace among youths in the area and state, further advocates for the active participation of youths in national development by effectively utilising the facilities provided. “The place of the youths cannot be underestimated in national development.

What is essential is the provision of required facilities for them to excel. “I humbly appeal to the youths to adequately utilise the facilities provided by the speaker and the government across the country and not vandalise them. “I call on all stakeholders to further deploy activities and resources that would easily facilitate and push the youths for developing our nation”, he said.
