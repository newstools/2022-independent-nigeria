Tottenham are ready to offer as much, hoping not to be involved in a bidding war. According to the report, Fabio Paratici has recently spoken to Torino directors asking for both him and Singo. The Premier League side could offer more than €50m to sign both players in the summer transfer window.

Cristian Romero, Pierluigi Gollini, Dejan Kulusevski and Rodrigo Bentancur have all joined the club over the last year.
