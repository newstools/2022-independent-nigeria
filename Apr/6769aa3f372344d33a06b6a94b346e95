Jose Mourinho continued his combative rapport with the media during a press conference, accusing a journalist of ‘sh***ing your pants’ in his presence. The Roma coach has been clashing repeatedly with various press figures during his conferences and today was no different. He already mocked them by holding up a piece of paper with ‘The second question will be about Zaniolo’ written on it, just as he was indeed asked about the Italy international after initial injury updates. Mourinho then took a question from a reporter who he evidently knew very well due to this response when asked about the three-man defence. “I expected a much more violent question from you. I heard you on the radio yesterday, you were much more aggressive, much more critical, much more violent. I was not expecting such an easy question. “The conclusion I therefore reach is that you are super aggressive and super violent on the radio, then you come here and s**t your pants in front of me.”
