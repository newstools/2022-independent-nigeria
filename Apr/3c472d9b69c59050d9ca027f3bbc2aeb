Netflix Nigeria, in partnership with EbonyLife Studios, is set to screen its first-ever Nigerian original series, ‘Blood Sisters’. Featuring some of Nollywood’s finest acts, the series will launch globally and exclusively on Netflix Come May 5, 2022. Excited at the collaboration and the prospects it holds, EbonyLife Studios’ Chief Executive, Mo Abudu described ‘Blood Sisters’ as a pulsating limited series. “Blood Sisters is a crime thriller, which is a new genre for us, so the prospect was challenging but very exciting! It was also a particularly unique and intense experience as we shot during the pandemic, but we remained committed to the vision we share with Netflix – to tell authentic and exciting African stories with superb production values,” she wrote. ‘Blood Sisters’, she said, tells the story of two friends – Sarah and Kemi. Sarah is engaged to her dream man, Kola. However, their seemingly idyllic union has a darkside and despite Kemi’s vocal misgivings, Sarah is determined to press on with the wedding. What follows is a heart-stopping series of catastrophic events. “To our cast and crew, thank you so much for your commitment, passion and professionalism to us making ‘Blood Sisters’ happen,” she added. The series stars Ini Dima Okojie, Nancy Isime, Kate Henshaw, Deyemi Okanlanwon, Uche Jombo, Gabriel Afolayan, Kehinde Bankole, Ramsey Nouah, Etim Effiong, Ibrahim Suleiman and a host of others. Late last year, Netflix and EbonyLife Studios revealed the cast of ‘Blood Sisters’, announcing that the four-part crime thriller will be directed by the cerebral Biyi Bandele and Kenneth Gyang. Also excited at the prospect of the movie is one of its star cast, Ini Dima-Okojie. She wrote; “It’s crazy, I cried my eyes out after watching this trailer this morning. We worked so hard day and night for months and now we finally get to share ‘Blood Sisters’. Who’s the victim and who’s the actual culprit?”
