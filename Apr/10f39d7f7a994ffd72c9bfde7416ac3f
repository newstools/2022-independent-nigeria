Antonio Conte was delighted his Tottenham side made the most of their rivals slipping up to take a big step towards Champions League football. Both Manchester United and Arsenal lost earlier in the day, and Spurs took full advantage as they beat Aston Villa 4-0 and moved three points clear in fourth. Heung-min Son scored a hat-trick in the ruthless win, with Dejan Kulusevski also on the scoresheet, and Conte hailed his side’s killer instinct in seizing the moment. “We have to look at ourselves – a strong team doesn’t depend on others,” Conte said. “We have to understand the moment to kill the opponent. Today was an important moment, especially because other results were good for us. “It was good because we won. If we don’t win, it’s not useful to look at the results of the other teams. “The winner has to feel when there is the blood of your opponents and then you have to try to kill them.” Tottenham were sensational in the second-half at Villa Park but they had to ride out some tricky moments in the first 45 minutes, with the home side well on top during the opening period. POLL A combination of Hugo Lloris and some poor finishing meant Villa trailed at the break, and Conte was impressed with the resilience his side displayed. “I have to be pleased to see this commitment, this attention and this accuracy in every situation,” Conte said. “The first half was very tough because Aston Villa brought high intensity and tried to put a good pressure on us. We showed a great consistency to be solid and at the same time, when we were in possession to score goals. “For sure a good moment for us. The hard work that we did this month was important. To have six, seven details to prepare is very important. You have time to take care of the details, to improve with the ball and without the ball, and the tactical situation. “We have grown in an important way and we are showing that it’s tough to play against us.”
