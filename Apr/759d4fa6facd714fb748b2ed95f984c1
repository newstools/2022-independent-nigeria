JOS – House of Representative hopeful and son of late former Deputy Senate President Ibrahim Mantu, Dr Umar Ibrahim Mantu, has declared his interest in contesting the Mangu/Bokkos Federal Constituency election in 2023 under the Platform of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). Dr Mantu, in an interview with newsmen at his Party’s Secretariat in Jos, the Plateau State capital, said his decision to run for the race is to serve his people at a higher capacity and to be their representative in the lower chambers of the National Assembly in 2023. According to him, he contested his party primaries in 2018 and lost by four votes to his opponent but added that he doesn’t believe in winning the election at all costs as there is always another time and that time has come. He disclosed that because of his love for the people of Mangu / Bokkos federal constituency, he has used his private NGO MANOMA foundation to do a lot of support work in Nigeria especially in more than six local government areas, especially in Mangu/ Bokkos Federal Constituency where he has donated kits to expectant mothers, mosquito nets to primary health centres, build schools, renovated classroom blocks, 14 boreholes through his private effort, not government effort. Mantu added that this time around, he is going to pick his party’s ticket for Mangu/Bokkos constituency to stand for the 2023 constituency election as it is God that gives power to whom he wishes. He said, “I should be given the opportunity to serve my people as God has shown me my purpose in life which to serve humanity.”
