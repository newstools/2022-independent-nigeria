André Onana will be looking forward to his imminent move to Inter as his relationship with the Ajax fans continues to deteriorate. The 26-year-old Cameroonian goalkeeper’s contract expires with the Dutch giants at the end of June and he’s set to leave on a free transfer, moving to Simone Inzaghi’s Inter as the long-term replacement for Samir Handanovic. As highlighted by VoetbalKrant, Onana was at fault for Groningen’s goal in Ajax’s 3-1 win yesterday, failing to make a save on a relatively speculative shot by Jørgen Strand Larsen, allowing the hosts to go ahead. Ajax managed to turn things around and win fairly comfortably, but the fans were not so quick to forgive the 26-year-old Cameroonian shot stopper, heavily criticising him and saying they’re tired of seeing him on the pitch. The only defence came from coach Erik Ten Haag, who highlighted a number of top saves made by the player. Onana’s relationship with the Ajax fans is continuing to deteriorate and it’s clear now that his departure in the summer is a good move for both parties.
