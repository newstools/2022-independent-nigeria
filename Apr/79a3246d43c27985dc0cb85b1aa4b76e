Xavi says Ousmane Dembele must decide whether he wants to stay at Barcelona as speculation over his future continues. The Frenchman had been expected to leave Camp Nou during the January transfer window as Barça attempted to push him out, but no move materialised and he has since played his back into the starting XI reckoning under Xavi. Having struggled for fitness under previous boss Ronald Koeman, Dembele has been given chances since the turn of the year and has been in excellent form recently, particularly impressing in victories over Athletic Club, Osasuna and Real Madrid. While uncertainty over his future continues, Xavi claimed he is pleased with Dembele’s contribution but said it is down to the former Borussia Dortmund forward to decide whether or not he wants to stay in Catalonia. He said: “I see him very happy, he’s very involved in the project since I arrived. I have no complaints about him. “It’s a question for Ousmane to answer on his future, I’m clear on that. “He’s making a real difference for us, he gives assists, and in our way of playing it’s very important because of how I want to play, as in one-on-ones he’s very good.” Dembele’s contract expires at the end of the season and his injury-riddled spell at Barça seemed to indicate a departure was on the cards back in January. However, there is still time for a U-turn, with the club in a much better position than it was towards the end of 2021. POLL 90min understands that Chelsea and Paris Saint-Germain remain interested in signing the winger. Barça have gone from Champions League hopefuls to top two contenders thanks to an unbeaten run of 13 league games, winning nine of those matches to lift them up to fourth. They are only three points behind second-placed Sevilla, having played a game fewer.
