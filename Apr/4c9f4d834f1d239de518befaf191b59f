The Nigerian National Petro­leum Corporation (NNPC) and Shell Nigeria Exploration and Production Company Limited (SNEPCo) on Thursday inau­gurated a state-of-the-art Infor­mation and Communication Technology (ICT) Centre at the Federal University of Pe­troleum Resources, Effurun, in Delta State. The 100-seater one-storey building was built and equipped by the NNPC and SNEPCo part­nership to promote research, teaching and learning in a con­ducive environment. Delta State Governor, Dr. If­eanyi Okowa, said, “The facility would go a long way in expand­ing the capacity of the students and staff of the university to compete locally and globally.” Represented by the state Commissioner for Science and Technology, Mrs. Jennifer Adesen-Efeviroro, Okowa com­mended NNPC and SNEPCo for the focused intervention, which he said could not have come at a better time when the world is technology-driven.
