Nigeria is still striving to achieve unrestricted use of family planning 26 years after the International Conference on Population and Development in Cairo, despite a number of myths and misperceptions.This is especially common among Nigerian women between the ages of 15 and 49 who want to use contemporary contraception but are discouraged from doing so due to misperceptions based on deep-seated socio-cultural beliefs.Many studies on the subject have focused on individual contraception attitudes over the years; nonetheless, myths about contraception spread readily within groups and prevent women from evaluating family planning options.In Nigeria, for example, myths and misconceptions differ from one community  to the other. Some common at the individual and communal levels are, “People who use contraceptives end up with health problems,” “contraceptives are detrimental to women’s health,” and “contraceptives can injure your womb.” “Using current family planning methods at an early age can cause infertility and prevent one from becoming pregnant in the future,” according to another.Some argue that “using condoms can lead to a reduced sperm count,” and that “a woman cannot become pregnant shortly after birth if her menses have not returned.”There are still some misconceptions regarding how contraceptives, like implants, dissolve inside a woman’s body.Some believe that when implants are utilised, they wander around the woman’s body from the hand to the brain, whereas the majority of women feel that family planning causes cancer.”A woman cannot become pregnant soon after delivery if she is breastfeeding,” “modern family planning fails,” “traditional family planning methods are safer and more effective than modern methods,” and “women are operated on during the insertion or removal of implant,” are among the other myths and misconceptions.Unfortunately, millions of women are still hampered or prevented from starting or continuing to utilise contemporary contraception because of harmful, difficult-to-address myths and misperceptions.The average number of births per woman was 3.0 when the Cairo conference hosted delegates from 180 nations, including Nigeria, thousands of non-governmental organisations, and activists from around the world in 1994.The conference endorsed a new approach to stabilise population and enhance development by recognising women’s critical role. Two and a half decades later, the global fertility rate has dropped to 2.5.But, this is not true about Nigeria which has emerged as the fourth most fertile African country at a yearly population growth of six million,  according to the 2020 World Population Data Sheet by the Population Reference Bureau (PRB). Sadly, her rising population along with its fertility and the birth rate is also two times higher than its death rate.As the fourth among the most fertile countries, its fertility rate put at 5.7 exceeds both the continent’s and global average Total Fertility Rate (TFR) which is 4.4 and 2.3 respectively, the PRB data further showed.Unfortunately, not every Nigerian woman of reproductive age who needs modern family planning has access to it. Indeed, surveys show that a major reason is concern about the side effects and/or health risks of contraceptive methods.However, the surveys don’t show how many of these women are avoiding modern contraception because of myths and misconceptions about the various methods. Obviously, reaching more Nigerian women who still want to plan childbearing, but aren’t using contraception will require innovative tactics and approaches to break down the myths and misconceptions that scare them away.Similarly, there is a need to respond to the very real side effects that these methods can cause. Research shows that there is no such thing as feeling some movements in the body after implant insertion.A contraceptive implant is inserted in the upper arm inside the surface of the foreskin in the upper arm. It is a very small or short surgical procedure that takes a little time to clear after a user.If you are on injectable, you need to give yourself some time before it is cleared out of your system. The female condom, or femidom, is made of polyurethane. It has a flexible ring at each end. One fixes behind the pubic bone to hold the condom in place, while the other ring stays outside the vagina.A diaphragm is a rubber, dome-shaped device that is inserted into the vagina and placed over the cervix. It fits into place behind the woman’s pubic bone and has a firm but flexible ring that helps it press against the vaginal walls.Used with spermicide, it is 88 percent effective. Used alone, it is between 77 and 83 percent effective.An intrauterine device (IUD) is a small, T-shaped device made of plastic that’s placed inside your uterus to prevent pregnancy. They provide long lasting, reliable protection against pregnancy, and they’re reversible. There are two types of IUDs: hormonal and non-hormonal. Several studies have demonstrated that birth spacing for a number of years, at least for a minimum of two years between one pregnancy and the next, provides a number of health benefits, with no evidence of a link to any disease or disorder.A well-informed service provider will make a significant difference in establishing trust in the adoption of family planning  in Nigeria.
