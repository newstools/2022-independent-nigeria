April 7, which marks the annual National Beer Day, celebrates the day a law went into effect in 1933 that allowed the brewing and sale of beer up to 4% alcohol by volume. The holiday was proposed by Richmond in 2009, Virginia., beer enthusiast Justin Smith, and the date April 7 was chosen to coincide with the anniversary of the date that the Cullen-Harrison Act took effect in 1933. The Cullen-Harrison Act allowed brewing and sale of beer containing up to 4% alcohol by volume. The act led to the repeal of the 21st Amendment and the end of Prohibition later in the same year. Till this day, National Beer Day is officially recognised in a 2017 proclamation by then- Gov. Terry McAuliffe of Virginia.
