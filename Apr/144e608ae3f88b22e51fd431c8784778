The Inspector-General of Police (IGP), Usman Alkali Baba, has charged all per­sonnel of the Force to take full advantage of the police health facilities in their respective commands and formations especially in light of the recent acquisi­tion and distribution on the basis of need, of hospital equipment necessary for both basic and advanced health services to police hospitals, clinics, and cot­tage health centres around the country. As part of events to mark this year’s World Malaria Day, the IGP has ensured the distribution of the acquired medical facilities which include, among others, 50 Oxy­gen Cylinders, 50 Oxygen Regulators, 52 Chemical Sprayers, 4 Electrocardio­gram (ECG) machines, Au­tomated External Defibril­lators (AEDs), Anesthetic Machines and accessories, Operating Tables, Hospital Beds/Mattresses, Incuba­tors, Autoclaves and Suc­tion Machines. CSP Olumuyiwa Adejo­bi, Force Public Relations Officer, Force Headquar­ters, Abuja disclosed this in a release made available to Daily Independent. Adejobi said the IGP noted that the services of Police Hospitals and Health Care Facilities were not re­stricted to Police person­nel alone as well-meaning members of the public can equally access and benefit from the top-notch services rendered at the Police Med­ical facilities across the country. He said the Inspec­tor-General of Police equal­ly admonished police per­sonnel to take advantage of these health facilities and engage in physical exercises, medical checks and good diet to improve their living conditions and reduce avoidable deaths while on duty, and subse­quently advance their ser­vice delivery. He said the IGP, in the spirit of the 2022 World Health Day, also charged the public to regularly imbibe good health con­ditions, environmental sanitation, reduction of activities responsible for the depletion of the ozone layer and all sorts of pol­lutions that are capable of damaging our ecosystem which in turn kills us si­lently on a regular basis.
