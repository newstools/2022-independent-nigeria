Sterling Bank Plc has stated that it will continue to support women and young girls who have been victims of gender-based violence at one time or another to develop the courage to break the silence in a bid to stop sexual harassment in the country. Mojisola Bakare, General Manager, Corporate and Investment Banking with Sterling Bank Plc, made the promise on behalf of the bank while speaking at the premiere of the movie Chatroom in Lagos recently. She explained that the movie is aimed at ‘Breaking the Silence’ about the gender-based abuse women and young girls go through in the Nigerian society. The film, produced by Olapeju Ibekwe, is a 98-minute movie that tells the inspiring story of Ebiere, a young, unassuming lady who enters a dancing reality TV show to escape the haunting experience of her past. The experiences in the house turn the table on her, causing national chaos. Addressing the audience at the event, Ibekwe said the CHATROOM project, which started a few years ago, was inspired by the true-life story of someone who is still alive. She urged more survivors to break the silence and speak up about their situations for the benefit of others, adding, “We wanted to create a story that would give people hope; to let us know that things happen, but we don’t have to wallow in the mud, and that was the beginning of CHATROOM. The movie is available on www.afrocinema.tv and can be watched from anywhere in the world. “ She added that a virtual chatroom has also been established on the movie website, www.chatroomthemovie. com, which will be a safe place for survivors where trained counsellors can help them.
