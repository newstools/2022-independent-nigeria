Jessie Lingard seems set to become the latest Englishman to make the move over to Serie A, with Milan, Juventus and Roma all keen to pick him up in the summer. The 29-year-old English forward is set to leave Manchester United at the end of this season when his contract expires, meaning he’ll be able to join a new club on a free transfer. West Ham and Newcastle United are both interested in signing him, but a future in Italy seems more likely. As reported by the Mirror, Lingard is keen on the idea of moving to Italy after seeing Chris Smalling and Tammy Abraham’s growth in Serie A. Roma, Milan and Juventus are all interested in picking up the Englishman on a free transfer and could battle it out for his signature in the summer. The 29-year-old Lingard has made 19 appearances across all competitions so far this season, for a total of 392 minutes. In that time, he’s scored two goals and provided one assist.
