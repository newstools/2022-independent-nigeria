LAGOS – Equiano, a new private subsea cable that will connect Africa with Europe, has berthed in the Lekki Peninsula area of Lagos. The subsea cable which started in western Europe runs along the West Coast of Africa, between Portugal and South Africa, with branching units along the way that can be used to extend connectivity to additional African countries. Nigeria is the first branch of its landing. This new cable is fully funded by Google, making it Equiano’s third private international cable after Dunant and Curie, and its 14th subsea cable investment globally. Expecting the launch are dignitaries from the government and private sector. Seated already is Lagos state commissioner of Science and Technology, Hakeem Fahm with other personalities. Google’s private subsea cables all carry the names of historical luminaries, and Equiano is no different. Named for Olaudah Equiano, a Nigerian-born writer and abolitionist who was enslaved as a boy, the Equiano cable is state-of-the-art infrastructure based on space-division multiplexing (SDM) technology, with approximately 20 times more network capacity than the last cable built to serve this region. Equiano will be the first subsea cable to incorporate optical switching at the fiber-pair level, rather than the traditional approach of wavelength-level switching. This greatly simplifies the allocation of cable capacity, giving us the flexibility to add and reallocate it in different locations as needed. And because Equiano is fully funded by Google, we’re able to expedite our construction timeline and optimize the number of negotiating parties. A contract to build the cable with Alcatel Submarine Networks was signed in Q4 2018, and the first phase of the project, connecting South Africa with Portugal, is expected to be completed in 2021. POLL The event will start shortly. Details later…
