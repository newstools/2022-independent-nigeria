JOS – One of the leading Plateau Governorship aspirants on the platform of the All Progressive Congress (APC), Chief Amos Gizo, has tipped National Leader of the Party, Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu, to emerge the APC’s presidential candidate at the 2023 presidential election. Chief Gizo, a political ally of the former Governor of Lagos, told newsmen at his campaign office at Kalwa House in Jos, the Plateau State capital, that Tinubu is the most qualified among the presidential aspirants of the party to fly the party’s flag at the 2023 presidential election. According to Gizo, a veteran politician in Plateau State, Tinubu has a political structure on the ground throughout the states of the federation that can match anybody PDP featured in the 2023 Presidential election. He said there are three methods of selecting the flag bearer of the party which are consensus, direct and indirect the party adding that the only one he knows that could be manipulated against Tinubu is consensus that the party coi bring someone outside the people they know. According to him even if the party insist on a consensus candidate, it should be Tinubu because he is the one that is most apt for the position. According to Gizo, looking at the role Tinubu played that led to the formation of the party, he sees nobody other than Tinubu picking the Presidential ticket of the party. Gizo added that whether direct, indirect or consensus, Tinubu is the only one he knows that has people on the ground that will be used as delegates to win the primaries. “Going by the roles Tinibu played in bringing this party on board, Tinubu’s roles was more than any other person in the party and so it behoves on every other person that Tinubu should be given that opportunity,” Chief Gizo stressed.
