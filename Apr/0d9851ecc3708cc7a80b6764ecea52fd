LAGOS  – The role of “Corporate Trust­ees in capital market debt is­suance is primarily hinged upon investors’ protection while not jeopardising the interests of the issuer.” STL Trustees Head of Trust Services, Akin Oni, stated this during his pre­sentation at a recent webinar organised by STL Trustees Limited titled, “The Role of Corporate Trustees in Capi­tal Market Debt Issuances.” Oni analyzed that at every point in time when an issuer comes to the capital market to raise capital for various devel­opmental projects or working capital requirements, inves­tors come together to provide the required funding to meet the issuer’s funding need. It is statutorily required that a corporate trustee be engaged to oversee the trust arrange­ment between the issuer and the bondholders and the role of the trustee include ensur­ing that the fund so raised is judiciously utilised in line with the use of proceeds as contained in the transaction documents so as not to jeop­ardize the interests of the in­vestors, ensuring repayment of both the coupon and prin­cipal of the bondholders as at when due, among other critical roles.
