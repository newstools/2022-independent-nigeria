Kenya, Zimbabwe To Be Included Despite FIFA BanLAGOS – The Confederation of African Football (CAF) has explained the draw procedure for the 2023 Africa Cup of Nations draws holding tonight at the SuperSport Studio in Johannesburg, South Africa. The 48 teams taking part in the tournament holding in Cote d’ Ivoire will know their group opponents. The teams were divided into four pots of 12 teams each based on FIFA ranking released on 31 March 2022. The teams will be drawn into 12 groups of four teams (Group A to L) with the top two teams from each group qualifying for the tournament to be played in Cote d’ Ivoire. The hosts will also participate in the draw despite already qualified for the tournament meaning only one team will qualify from the group. Kenya and Zimbabwe, who have been suspended by FIFA from all football activities globally, will also be included in the draw despite their temporary bans. However, if the suspension is not lifted two weeks before their first matchday of the qualifiers, both associations will be considered as losers and eliminated from the competition. Consequently, their groups will be composed of three teams with the first and runner-up teams of those groups qualifying to the final tournament. As a result of that decision, Kenya and Zimbabwe cannot be drawn in the same group in order to avoid having one group with only two teams in case the suspension on both associations is not lifted. POLL In the draw to be conducted by the CAF Director of Competitions Samson Adamu and assisted by African football legends Lucas Radebe of South Africa and Ivorien Solomon Kalou, the first ball will be drawn from Pot 4 and will go to position A4. The procedure will be repeated for the remaining teams of Pot 4 who will go to positions B4, C4, D4, E4, F4, G4, H4, I4, J4, K4 & L4 according to the draw order. The same procedure as above will be repeated for Pot 3, Pot 2 and finally Pot 1. The qualifiers will start in June 2022.
