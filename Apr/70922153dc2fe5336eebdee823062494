A bandits’ leader, identified as Nasanda, has requested the sum of N30 million from Zamfara State government over the death of wife, her uncle and her aunt. The bandits’ leader disclosed this in a viral audio message, stating that he would avenge their death by killing 300 people if the State government doesn’t pay the 30 million naira with 14-day. He said, “If the State government fails to pay the compensation, I vow that I would lead to the killing of 300 community people “I cannot give months for the government to settle me, the 14 days would be enough to settle my demands. And we will not attack until when people are on their farms. If our Fulani people are not allowed to live in peace, we will also not allow others to live in peace. “If the government can’t pay the N30 million demanded, the government should be ready to see me in action. I will kill 300 people to avenge the death of my bride and two of her relations. Yes, the lives of 900 will be in danger.”
