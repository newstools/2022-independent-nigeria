Roy Hodgson has said he is not guaranteed to stay as Watford manager until the end of the season as the club take another step toward relegation. Manchester City were rampant on a sunny day at the Etihad only adding to the ‘Orns woes. Gabriel Jesus stole the show scoring four times – twice in each half – as City cruised to a 5-1 Premier League victory. Rodri also got in the act with a wonderful volley that came just six minutes after Hassane Kamara had momentarily reduced the score to 2-1. As a result, the ‘Orns remain second-last in the league, one point above the very bottom, and seven points from safety, with just five games to save their season. While a positive result at the Etihad was not expected, it does all but confirm their relegation down into the Championship next term. Watford have already sacked Xisco Munoz and Claudio Ranieri this season. And, having failed to arrest the negative slide he inherited upon arrival in Hertfordshire, Hodgson confessed he was not sure he would make it until the end of the season. Speaking in his press conference after the defeat. he said: “No. no assurances at all. So that’s another matter altogether. If they think that the situation can be changed by getting rid of myself and Ray [Lewington], then that will be their prerogative. “I’ve never asked for any assurances since I came to the club. I said: ‘I’ll come to the club, I do the job to the best of my ability’. But I’ve never once asked for an assurance, and I don’t have those types of conversations with the owner.” He also added: “When I came in, I was given a mandate and the club made it clear what they would like Ray and I to do to try and get a better organisation certainly defensively. “But having said that, you know, even that hasn’t worked in the way we would like because when you concede five goals up here, you can’t say we’ve improved the defending as much as we would have liked.”
