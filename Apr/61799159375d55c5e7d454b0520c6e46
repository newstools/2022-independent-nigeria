The All Progressives Congress (APC) presidential hopeful and Minister of Labour and Employment, Chris Ngige has revealed why he won’t resign to contest the 2023 presidential election yet. The Minister made this disclosure while speaking to journalists immediately after the Federal Executive Council (FEC) meeting on Wednesday in Abuja. He, however, denied knowledge of the APC directives that all appointees should resign ahead of the May 30 presidential primary. According to him, he has not received any specific instruction from the ruling APC on his presidential ambition while maintaining that his decision to remain a member of the FEC is in line with the 1999 Constitution, as amended. The Minister further stated that the March 18 judgement of the Federal High Court in Umuahia, struck out Section 84(12) of the Electoral Act, adding that he is under no compulsion to resign his appointment. When asked when he will resign in line with his party directives, he said: “Because I don’t know about that I’m hearing for the first time from you. But like I always say, I’ll be guided by the letters and spirit of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria.”
