A Russian missile struck a crowded train station in eastern Ukraine on Friday where thousands of people were waiting to evacuate, Ukrainian authorities said on Friday — killing at least 30 people and drawing new outrage over Moscow’s ongoing military campaign. The missile struck the station in Kramatorsk, where civilians had gathered for a way out of the battle-torn area. More than 100 people were injured, officials said. Kramatorsk is located about 50 miles north of Donetsk and 80 miles northwest of Luhansk — regions of eastern Ukraine, known as the Donbas, that have been at odds with the Ukrainian government for almost a decade. Kramatorsk is located within Donetsk Oblast. Prior to Friday’s missile attack, many at the train station were attempting to evacuate the dangerous region that has repeatedly been hit by Russian shelling over the past six weeks.
