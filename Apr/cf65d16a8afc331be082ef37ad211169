LAGOS – The Governance Advisory Council (GAC), the apex decision-making body within the Lagos state chapter of the All Progressives Congress (APC) on Monday approved the second term for Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu at its meeting this afternoon at State House, Marina. The GAC is led by Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, former governor of the state and APC National leader. With the APC governorship election primaries slated for May 27, the speculation on whether Sanwo-Olu will get a second term has become rife among the business and political elites in the state, especially members of the APC. Sanwo-Olu has not said anything about running for a second term and has not picked his nomination forms for the election apparently waiting for the official endorsement of the party chieftains. It would be recalled that his predecessor, Former Governor Akinwumi Ambode, failed to secure a second term in office because he fell out of favour with the party structure and GAC members despite the popular sentiments that he performed very well enough in office to deserve a second term.
