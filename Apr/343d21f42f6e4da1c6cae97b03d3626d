Former Nigerian Senator, Shehu Sani, has stated that the armed men responsible for the killing and abduction of the Abuja-Kaduna train are ‘jihadist’ terrorists. Recall that on 28, March 2022, terrorists attacked the Abuja-Kaduna train with 362 passengers, claiming the lives of six-person, leaving several others injured and some abducted. According to the former lawmaker in a tweet via his official Twitter page, the terrorists are not bandits as alleged. The tweet reads, “The video footage of the Train terrorists & their hostages making demands to the Government confirmed the fact that the cruel abductors were not just bandits but ‘Jihadist’ terrorists. “Authorities must walk the tight rope of freeing the hostages without bowing to terrorists.”
