LAGOS  – The International Air Transport Association (IATA), has reported passenger growth of 115.9 per cent in February 2022, compared to the same period in 2021. A statement by the association said that air travel posted a strong rebound in February 2022 compared to January 2022, as Omicron-related impacts moderated outside of Asia. The statement further hinted that the ongoing war in Ukraine, which began on 24 February, did not have a major impact on traffic levels. IATA said that the 115.9 climb was an improvement from January 2022, which was up 83.1 per cent compared to January 2021. When it compared the current statistics with February 2019, however, it said traffic was down 45.5 per cent. According to IATA, February 2022 domestic traffic was up 60.7 per cent when compared to the year-ago period, building on a 42.6 per cent increase in January 2022 compared to January 2021. It said there was wide variation in markets tracked by it as domestic traffic in February was 21.8 per cent below the volumes of February 2019. International Revenue Passenger Kilometers (RPKs) increased by 256.8 per cent versus February 2021, improved from a 165.5 per cent year-over-year increase in January 2022 versus the year-earlier period. POLL All regions improved their performance compared to the prior month. February 2022 international RPKs were down 59.6 per cent compared to the same month in 2019. “The recovery in air travel is gathering steam as governments in many parts of the world lift travel restrictions. States that persist in attempting to lock-out the disease, rather than managing it, as we do with other diseases, risk missing out on the enormous economic and societal benefits that a restoration of international connectivity will bring,” said Willie Walsh, IATA’s Director-General. European carriers saw their February traffic rise 380.6 per cent versus February 2021, improved over the 224.3 per cent increase in January 2022 versus the same month in 2021. Capacity rose 174.8 per cent, and load factor climbed 30.3 percentage points to 70.9 per cent. Asia-Pacific airlines had a 144.4 per cent rise in February traffic compared to February 2021, up somewhat over the 125.8 per cent gain registered in January 2022 versus January 2021.
