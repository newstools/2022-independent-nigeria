In a recent report, Super Deporte mentioned that Arsenal are set to rival Juventus for Atletico Madrid forward Alvaro Morata. It has been claimed that the Gunners are open to paying €35m for the Spain international. Morata is having a decent campaign in Spanish football after producing a series of influential displays as the spearhead of Atletico’s attack. The 29-year-old has banged in 11 goals and grabbed eight assists in 42 matches for the Spanish outfit this season across all fronts. The Madrid-born talent has given a good account of himself in the final third by averaging 1.7 tackles, 1.3 key passes and 0.7 dribbles per 90 minutes in Serie A. He has even been accurate when distributing the ball up top, as evidenced by his pass success rate of 75.9% in top-flight football . Morata is a decent dribbler with the ball at his feet when he is playing with confidence on the field. He excels at creating a yard of space for himself to get a few shots in on target and can create some inviting openings for others around him. At 29, the Spaniard is currently playing at his prime and would add some much-needed firepower to Arsenal boss Mikel Arteta‘s attack. Plus, he would serve as a slight upgrade over Alexandre Lacazette at the North London club next season. However, the former Chelsea striker needs to work hard on improving his link-up play on the attacking end of the field if he wants to taste more success in the coming seasons. Morata is good enough to earn a regular starting spot at the Emirates Stadium if Arteta can find a way to bring him to the English capital this summer. The Atletico Madrid centre-forward might still have a few good years left in him to play at a high level. Morata has enough experience to help the Gunners challenge for a top-four finish in the Premier League next season. Thus, it makes sense for Arsenal to engineer a move to secure the signature of the Spanish striker when the transfer window reopens later this year.
