Liverpool moved back to with­in one point of English Premier League leaders Manchester City and left neighbours Ever­ton languishing in the bottom three after victory in the Mer­seyside derby. Struggling Everton made Liverpool fight for their win with a well-organised and disciplined performance that will give them hope they can still avoid the drop but was not enough to deny Jurgen Klopp’s quadruple-chasing side. Liverpool can find different ways to get the job done and af­ter blowing Manchester United aside on Tuesday they demon­strated patience to finally break down Everton’s stubborn resis­tance in what could prove to be a priceless win. The deadlock was broken after 62 minutes when Andy Robertson arrived at the far post in front of the Kop to head home Mo Salah’s cross. Everton could not respond, although Demarai Gray pow­ered a drive just wide, and Liverpool wrapped up the win when substitute Divock Origi tormented the neighbours once again when he headed in Luis Diaz’s bicycle kick with six min­utes left. The loss means the Toffees end the day in the top-flight’s bottom three for the first time since 6 December 2019. They were last in the relegation zone this far into the season in 1998/99.
