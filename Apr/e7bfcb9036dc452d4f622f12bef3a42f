As gladiators position for sen­atorial ambition ahead of the 2023 general elections, Emeka Odumegwu-Ojukwu (Jnr), son of the late Biafran lead­er and Ikemba Nnewi, Dim Chukwuemeka Odumegwu Ojukwu, has endorsed the aspiration of Senator Victor Umeh to run for the Anambra Central Senatorial District. Compared with all other aspirants for the seat, Ojuk­wu Jr said that Senator Umeh has the maturity and experi­ence to best represent the in­terest of Anambra people and Ndigbo generally at the upper legislative chamber, aside the intimate ties between him and the late Dim Ojukwu. Other aspirants for the Anambra Central Senatorial District for now include Ok­agbue Uzugbenem, former protocol officer to erstwhile Governor Willy Obiano and Dozie Nwankwo. Ojukwu Jnr, who opened up on the race for the senatori­al position in Abuja declared that he knows the aspirants well to voice the opinion. “Well I don’t think any­body needs me to expound on the relationship between Sen­ator Victor Umeh and Eze-Ig­bo. He was very close to my father, right from the onset of the party, before he stepped up to be the national chairman.”
