LAGOS  – Lead Pastor, Harvesters International Christian Centre (HICC), Bolaji Id­owu has called on church leaders and ministers to be united for the expansion of the gospel of the kingdom. The pastor made the call yesterday during the an­nouncement of the fourth edition International School of Ministry (ISM) Global Ministers Class­room (GMC) conference in Lagos. The programme slat­ed for April 29 and April 30, 2022, initiated by the founder and president of LoveWorld Incorporated, also known as Christ Em­bassy, Chris Oyakhilome is a conglomeration of minis­ters of the gospel: Pastors, Bishops, Apostles, Evange­lists, Prophets and Ministry leaders. Speaking on the pro­gramme, Idowu said so much is happening in the world and it has become im­perative that ministers of the gospel come together in the unity of the faith, to stra­tegically plan the expansion. “This year is the fourth edition of this historic class­room with Pastor Chris and it will be a very transform­ing and transformative time for ministers of the gospel. We are therefore filled with great excitement, anticipa­tion and joy for all that the Lord will accomplish in our lives as ministers of the gospel as we participate in this global classroom from around the world and in particular, ministers of the gospel here in Nigeria.”
