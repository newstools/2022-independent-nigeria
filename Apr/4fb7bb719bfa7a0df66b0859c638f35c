Nollywood actor, Yul Edochie, has urged Nigerians to support his presidential ambition ahead of the 2023 general election. The actor disclosed this on Saturday, urging Nigerians to help him buy the presidential form in order to assist him in fixing Nigeria. This plea is coming after the actor announced the existence of his son by his second wife, Judy Austin on Wednesday. His post reads, “See what we did on Wednesday, we shook the world and still shaking it. The energy you all applied, and still apply is unmatchable. “The energy is united. The energy knows no tribe, no religion, no gender; the energy is coming from the North, the South, from the East, and the West and indeed, the whole world. “Once again, the energy is united. We are everywhere, on TV stations, radio stations, newspapers, blogs, Internet, Youtube, WhatsApp groups, churches, streets, we are on the lips of everyone; we are everywhere. The energy is unparallel. “My dear Nigerians, we can make use of this energy positively. I cannot do this alone, we cannot do this alone, we need you, I need you, Nigerians. Nigeria needs you. “My fellow Nigerians, please buy me the presidential form and together we will take back our country and fix it. POLL “My name is Yul Edochie, I am running for the President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria in 2023. Thank you and God bless Nigeria. Thank you.”
