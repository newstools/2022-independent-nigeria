Sri Lanka has declared a 36-hour nationwide curfew and deployed troops backed with sweeping powers under a state of emergency to quell protests against the president, his relatives and even his trusted shaman. The lockdown will go into effect at dusk on Saturday and be lifted on Monday morning — a period that covers planned mass anti-government protests against worsening shortages of fuel, food and medicines. The order comes days after President Gotabaya Rajapaksa invoked a state of emergency following a violent attempt to storm his house, saying it was for the “protection of public order”. The ire of a mob in the near-bankrupt country was directed on Saturday at a woman identified as a soothsayer frequently consulted by Rajapaksa in the northern town of Anuradhapura. Rights activist and former opposition legislator Hirunika Premachandra led dozens of women to storm seer Gnana Akka’s shrine and residence, but armed police stopped them. “Why are police protecting a shaman?” she asked a senior officer who physically blocked her march, as seen on a Facebook live video. “Think of the country and let us pass,” another woman activist pleaded.
