The national leader of the All Progressives Congress (APC) and presidential aspirant, Bola Ahmed Tinubu, is set to obtain his expression of interest and nomination forms to contest the 2023 presidential election today. The presidential form which is valued at N100 million would allow him to contest the Presidential ticket of the ruling party. It was gathered that associates of the former Lagos governor will pick up the forms at the APC National Headquarters in Abuja. In January, Tinubu, who is currently in Mecca, Saudi Arabia for lesser hajj, informed President Muhammadu Buhari of his presidential ambition. In an interview with reporters, Tinubu said his ambition to be President has been life-long, noting that what he did in Lagos during his time as Governor, he has the capacity to do in the entire country. On why he would not remain a kingmaker, Tinubu said nothing stops a kingmaker from becoming the king unless he has committed murder. The APC leader has begun consulting with various stakeholders regarding his 2023 presidential ambition. Naija News reports that Tinubu will join the likes of the Minister of State for Education, Chukwuemeka Nwajiuba; Governors of Kogi and Ebonyi State, Yahaya Bello and Dave Umahi to obtain the APC presidential form.
