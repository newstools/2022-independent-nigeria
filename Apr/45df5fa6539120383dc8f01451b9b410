Nigerian Air Force (NAF) fighter jet targeting terrorists has reportedly killed at least six children in Kuregba community of Shiroro Local Government Area of Niger State. Daily Independent gathered that the air component of the Joint Security Operatives mistakenly struck the community while trying to bombard the hideouts of terrorists in some part of the local government. The Coalition of Shiroro Associations Spokesman, Salis Mohammed Sabo, said the incident happened in the morning when the children were fetching water from a motorised borehole within the Kurebe community. Sabo said a father lost two of his daughters and two granddaughters to the strike, adding that the community where the airstrike took place was not the hideout of the bandits. “The terrorists’ camps are well known. The terrorists around the community are of two groups, with two different camps. One links up with the community through Unguwan Zomo, the other through Kwantan Yashi area,” he said. Efforts to reach the spokesman of the NAF, Air Commodore Edward Gabkwet, proved abortive as calls to his mobile did not connect. He had yet to reply to a text message sent to his mobile phone or issued a statement as of when filing this report.
