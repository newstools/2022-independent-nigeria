ASABA – National Chairman of the People’s Democratic Party (PDP), Senator Iyorcha Ayu, on Friday expressed fear over the division in the state chapter of the Party over the successor of Delta State Governor Ifeanyi Okowa. During his address on the occasion of the Commissioning of internal roads in Asaba, Oshimili South Local Government Area of the state, Senator Iyorcha cautioned party stakeholders against division that could cost the state in the 2023 elections. He maintained that it would be devastating to lose the state due to division rather than non-performance. “We cannot lose Delta State, particularly with the performance of Okowa in the last four years. It is normal to have disagreement but whatever it is should remain a family disagreement. Nothing should divide the united PDP family in Delta State” he asserted. He lauded the infrastructural development of Governor Okowa saying that only a committed democrat of the party can do what Okowa has done. He further noted that the state governor in the party has justified the need for a change of leadership at the federal level. “It is only in PDP you see the Party Chairman commission projects. That is not so for other parties. All they commission elsewhere are bandits and terrorists who make life unbearable for Nigerians,” he declared. POLL Earlier during his speech, Governor Ifeanyi Okowa noted that he has no intention of slowing down the spade of construction while he promised to complete ongoing projects.
