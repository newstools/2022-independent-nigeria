The newly-inaugurated Chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Sen. Abdullahi Adamu has urged Senate Minority Leader, Enyinnaya Abaribe, to leave the opposition People’s Democratic Party (PDP) in order to actualize his political ambition. Adamu made the appeal on Thursday at a valedictory session organized to mark the exit of Adamu; Deputy National Chairman (North), Abubakar Kyari; and Deputy Governor of Zamfara State, Hassan Muhammad Nasiha. Recall that Abaribe, who is eying the PDP governorship ticket in Abia State, had been caught in the web of a zoning formula, which favours Abia Central and Abia North senatorial districts. Speaking on Abaribe’s governorship ambition, Adamu said: “Some of you are the best materials this country can have but you are in the wrong camp. It is in my heart of hearts, those of you who are willing to reach out to a higher pedestal, our hands are open and we are stretching the hands to you. “l assure you, among you, there is the best governor Abia State ever had. Among you, there is a good governor to be, that is being denied. “Come over. We are very humane, very fair; we play according to the rules of the game. “I assure you that I will continue to cherish our relationship. I hope and pray that you will see the light and come over to APC.”
