Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi reaffirmed Tehran’s support for security, stability and establishment of a strong government in Iraq, warning that the US has no compassion for Muslim nations, particularly for the Iraqi people.In a telephone conversation with his Iraqi counterpart on Sunday, Raisi said Iran supports Iraq’s unity, independence, security, and the elevation of the Arab country’s regional and international standing. He also voiced Tehran’s backing for the formation of a strong government in Baghdad, stressing the need for efforts to ensure regional security and calm without foreign interference. Raisi said time has proved the truth of the remarks from Leader of the Islamic Revolution Ayatollah Seyed Ali Khamenei that the US has by no means any sympathy for the Muslim nations in the region, especially for the Iraqis. It has now become clear that the outsiders are only after hegemony and fulfillment of their own interests, the Iranian president added. “Any country in the region that neglects the hegemonic objectives of the US and the Zionist regime would trample on the interests of its nation and be abhorred by the Muslim nations,” he added. For his part, Iraqi President Barham Salih called for close cooperation between Baghdad and Tehran to overcome regional challenges, saying Iran plays a major role in the establishment of regional stability and security. Iraq and Iran have common views and goals at the regional and international levels, he stated, noting that closer cooperation and coordination would help them take effective steps in fulfilling the interests of the regional nations. The remedy for the regional crises relies on the willpower of the nations and intra-regional solutions without foreign interference, Salih added.
