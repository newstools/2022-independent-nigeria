UGHELLI – The member representing Bomadi/Patani Federal Constituency, Nicholas Mutu, has said that his in­tention to seek re-election for the seventh term was a response to a divine call. Mutu stated this when as he paid a consultative visit to the Peoples Dem­ocratic Party (PDP) dele­gates at Uduophori town in Patani Council Area and Bomadi town in Boma­di Council Area of Delta State, saying that God’s mandate for him is sev­en-term in the National Assembly, thereafter he would seek for other elec­tive position. The House of Represen­tatives aspirant said 2023 will usher in new leader­ship at the federal level, it was wise for the delegates to elect an experienced hand into the National Assembly for him to at­tract development to the constituency. Mutu denied rumour going around that he en­dorsed Basil Ganagana to take over from him in 2023, adding that the video clips and clergymen who were around during the said gathering for endorsement denied knowledge of it. The lawmaker appealed to the delegates to look at his antecedent from 1999 to date, saying that he has affected every town and community that made up the constituency positively. He affirmed that he has been a true party man de­spite his travail and perse­cution due to his ranking position in the National Assembly, but remained faithful and refused to be bought over by the All Pro­gressive Congress (APC).
