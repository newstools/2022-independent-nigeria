Lagos – While so many Nigerians believe that the Super Eagles should seamlessly qualify for the 2023 Africa Cup of Nations after the country was pooled in Group A of the qualifiers alongside Sierra Leone, Guinea-Bissau and Sao Tome and Principe, the team’s former defender thinks it would not be a stroll in the pack as many thinks. Obinna Nwaneri, former Super Eagles full back, said thinking that the qualification would be easy because Super Eagles were grouped alongside the so-called minnows would be a huge mistake. Nwaneri said recent results from different continents and countries should serve as warning to the Super Eagles on the premise that nothing is won on paper, challenging them to take every match, as the final if the would easily qualify. “The group looks easy but nothing is quite easy nowadays because football is evolving by the day. “Who could have believed that Northern Macedonia would stop Italy from going to the World Cup? I cannot imagine that. “What of Ghana and Comoros who made sure the Black Stars could not make it beyond the first round at the last Cup of Nations. “You see the group is fair to be honest but nothing is certain until qualification is achieved and I want to let our players know that hey have to take every game serious and even qualify before the last game,” the CAF Champions League winner with Enyimba of Aba said. Nigeria failed to progress beyond the second round of the last AFCON after the Super Eagles were dumped out by the Carthage Eagles of Tunisia in a game Nigeria was highly tipped to win following their seamless group stage performance where they saw of Egypt, Sudan and Guinea Bissau.
