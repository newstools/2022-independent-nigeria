Delegates of the Social Democratic Party (SDP) exchanged blows at the congress of the Imo State chapter of the party. Trouble started when Chairman of the party in Owerri zone, Chidiebere Oja, insisted that the congress would not go on over the suspicion that some members were planning to hijack the party. He and other party members, who had gathered at the Wethral Road secretariat of the party for the congress, insisted that the exercise must be suspended. The disagreement degenerated as the members freely threw chairs and any nearby objects at one another. They asked the staff Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) invited for exercise to leave. The Oguta local government area chairman of SDP, Chidi Oziri, and his Okigwe LGA counterpart, Nwankwo Maduka, had a serious shouting match. The alteration between the two chieftains drew the attention of their supporters, with each group trying to defend their master. The state chairman of the party, Mr. Ben Anochie, who spoke to newsmen said the exercise had to be suspended to restore order. POLL He said a new date date for the congress would be made known after a meeting of the State Working Committee (SWC).
