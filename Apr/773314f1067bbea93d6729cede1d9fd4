Chief Justice Bridget Mary McCormack said in a statement that she was tested Saturday and had notified the court’s other justices and other close contacts. McCormack said she had a negative result on a COVID-19 test on Tuesday ahead the court hearing oral arguments Wednesday. “As previously noted, I am fully vaccinated, and have had two boosters,” McCormack said. Court spokesman John Nevin said he knew of no current illnesses among the six other justices and that McCormack planned to follow COVID-19 quarantine guidelines.
