It has been joy and happiness unlimited in the home front of the matriarch of the illustrious Igbinedion family of Okada, Edo state. The elegant lady of means and abundant beauty, Lady Cherry Igbinedion and wife of the billionaire businessman, Sir Gabriel Igbinedion, clocked graciously and majestically the milestone age of 70 eventful years on earth. In recent days, the word finesse may have joined the stash of street lingo now being thrown around. It is gradually losing its characteristic softness, class, and unique implications. Despite this, there are still individuals who embody these words and adjectives in their original and truest form, and they do it so well that it is best to include another melodious word, poise or charisma. Like it is often said, some are born great while some have greatness thrust on them with their charm and grace. Lady Cherry Igbinedion of Benin Kingdom is one of the latter while her husband, Chief Gabriel, is undoubtedly in the first category. Both of them are as suited for each other as matching colours are to flowers in their ambience, irrespective of their advancing age. At 70, Lady Cherry continues to consolidate the excellence and illustriousness of the great Igbinedion family, and by extension gradually becoming one of the main pillars of this majestic clan. Lady Cherry has sired Omosede, Ivie, Amenze and Orobosa Igbinedion, and is currently wallowing in her new status as a septuagenarian. Chief Gabriel has never failed to give due honour to Lady Cherry. Judging from his words over the years, many wives there may be in the Igbinedion household but Cherry is a radiant flower among them.
