ABEOKUTA – The Association of Community Pharmacists of Nigeria (ACPN) has described the late Alaafin of Oyo, Oba Lamidi Adeyemi III, as a bridge-builder of young and future generations. National Chairman of the as­sociation, Adewale Oladigbolu, noted this in a statement issued in Abeokuta on Wednesday. Oladigbolu, a Prince of Agunloye Ruling House, ex­pressed his gratitude to God for the grace and privilege given to the late traditional ruler over the countless contributions and goals achieved during his 52 years of impactful and memora­ble reign. According to him, the late Oba Adeyemi has written his name in gold as he was so pas­sionate in promoting and pre­serving cultural values. He noted that the late tradi­tional ruler contributed his quo­ta to the peaceful coexistence among his people and Nigeria as a whole. Recall that the late Oba Ad­eyemi joined his ancestors last Friday at the Afe Babalola Multi System Hospital, Ado Ekiti, at the age of 83 and has since been buried. Meanwhile, the Basorun of Oyo, head of Oyomesi, the kingmakers, has taken over the leadership of the ancient town pending the emergence of a new Alaafin.
