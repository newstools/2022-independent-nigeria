EJIKEME OMENAZU Rev. Dr. Grace Deh, Presiding Minister and Visioner, Altar of Praise and Worship, has lamented that the Nigerian women are not taken seriously by the country’s leadership. Speaking with Sunday INDEPENDENT on the long drawn protests by women in recent time, she maintained that the Nigerian women needed a pride of place in the country’s administration for the nation to progress and prosper. She lamented that only the few women whose parents gave special love and educated were being taken seriously. Rev Deh stated: “I call on more women to join the protests. They are not just demanding for their rights. They are fighting for the rights of the unborn child. “May God empower them to remain tenacious. God will fight for them. The women who are not on the frontline of this fight should be supporting with prayer because those women are fighting for our future and destiny. “Women should not accept that they are nothing. The women are joint heirs with the men.” Rev Deh maintained that the problem of women was due to the fact that for long, ‘right from their upbringing, women have been relegated to the background d, even in education. POLL “So, women need re-education and re-evaluation and re-orientation on how important they are, even from creation. That was why God created them. “Where you have a nation where women are ineffective, that nation needs help. Unfortunately, such a nation will keep thinking it needs foreign aids. “What such a nation needs is to empower women. Globally, countries that do well are where women are empowered and have their rights, while those that are poor are where women are denied their rights. “What Nigeria needs is to give the women their rights and not foreign aids”.
