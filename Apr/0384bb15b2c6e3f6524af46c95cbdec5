Operatives of the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA), have raided and sealed Diplomatic Suite Hotel, Asokoro, Abuja in a joint operation with men of the De­partment of State Services (DSS) to stop a cannabis party and the launch of a suspected new psychoactive drink. About 200 attendees including three young ladies who organised the hemp party are currently be­ing profiled and interviewed while bottles of the new drink have been taken for lab analysis. Femi Babafemi, Director, Media & Advocacy, NDLEA Headquarters, Abuja, disclosed this in a release Thursday. Babafemi said the hotel was raid­ed at about 8:18 p.m. on Wednesday, April 20, 2022 following actionable intelligence that some youths were planning to hold a hemp party at the hotel. He said quantities of cannabis sativa were recovered from the pock­ets and bags of those arrested at the hemp party. He said, “The audacious party no doubt is part of attempts by some elements to create a drug subculture in the Nigerian social space. The ND­LEA will however continue to work with other security agencies and rel­evant stakeholders to ensure abuse of illicit substances is not allowed to get entrenched in the country under any guise.”
