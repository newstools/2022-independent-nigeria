IBADAN – A former Chairman of the Peo­ples Democratic Party (PDP) in Oyo State, Alhaji Kunmi Mustapha, has said that the de­fection of members of African Democratic Congress (ADC), led by the leader of the party in the state, Senator Monsurat Sunmonu, to PDP on Tuesday indicated that the governor did not renege on his promises to members of ADC for inclusion and good governance. Governor Seyi Makinde had in the wake of the 2019 gubernatorial election prom­ised a coalition of political parties that included ADC that he would fulfill all promises he made during the coalition agreement meeting, which in­cluded appointment of com­missioners, Special Advisers, Chairmen and members of commissions, boards and para­statals among members as well as appointment of ADC mem­bers into the local government councils among other various political offices. Mustapha, in a press re­lease he made available to journalists on Thursday in Ibadan, appreciated the ADC members, led by the former first female Senator in Oyo State for staying on course throughout the period of elec­tioneering and her members’ support to the governor in promoting good governance in Oyo State. Mustapha, who is the Spe­cial Adviser to the Governor on Inter-Party Affairs, main­tained that the defection was an outcome of consultations that had started since the be­ginning of the present admin­istration. He saluted the efforts of the incumbent party Chairman, Hon. Dayo Ogungbenro, Par­ty Leaders and Stakeholders across the State, especially for leading a party that has be­come a beautiful bride to many in the State through what he called the visible performance of Makinde.
