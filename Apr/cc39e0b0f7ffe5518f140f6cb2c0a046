David Moyes has revealed there is a hope Ben Johnson’s absence will not be a long-term one. The defender missed Sunday’s win over Everton, only the fifth time he was not been involved in a Premier League squad this season. With Vladimir Coufal only fit enough for the bench as he ramps up his own return from injury, the idea of missing Johnson for a pivotal few weeks will be a concerning one. West Ham host Lyon in their Europa League quarter-final clash on Thursday before traveling to France a week later with a trip to Brentford in-between as they attempt to keep up their European challenge on a domestic front too. Speaking after watching his side condemn Frank Lampard’s team to another way defeat, Moyes offered a hopeful update on Johnson’s injury, a hamstring problem he picked up while making his debut for the England U21s during the international break. “He felt his hamstring playing for England on Wednesday night,” said the Scotsman. “He trained Friday and Saturday but felt it again Saturday. We don’t think it’s bad but it was a decision today. I’m hoping he’ll be ok.”
