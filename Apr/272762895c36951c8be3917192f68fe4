One of the leading Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) as­pirants for the Delta State 2023 governorship election, Olorogun David Edevbie, has expressed his preference for a female running mate if giv­en the ticket. Edevbie disclosed this at the palace of the Olu of War­ri, HRM Ogiame Atuwatse III, when he paid the mon­arch of the Iwere Kingdom a consultation visit. Speaking on his agenda for Public Service Reforms and his decision to reserve 35% of appointive positions for women, in line with the global Affirmative Ac­tion and 25% for youths, he argued that women and youths are the largest in number in population and their increased inclusion in governance wais necessary not only for the government to be more reflective of the people it governs but also to allow for wider shades of opinions in planning gov­ernment programmes and policies. “If I am allowed, I will pre­fer a woman as my deputy if given the ticket. Statistically, we have more women than men but they are not suffi­ciently included in gover­nance. Empirically too, it has been proven that women are more committed to service, are more hardworking and are less corrupt than men.”
