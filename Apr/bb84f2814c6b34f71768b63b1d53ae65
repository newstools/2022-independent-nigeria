Lagos – Nigeria Super Eagles will kickoff their quest to qualify for the 2023 Africa Cup of Nations in Cote d’ Ivoire with a home game against Leone Stars of Sierra Leone on May 30, 2022. Following Tuesday’s draw in Johannesburg, South Africa, Nigeria was grouped alongside Sierra Leone, Guinea Bissau and either of Sao Tome Principe or Mauritius. After hosting Sierra Leone, the Super Eagles will play their second group game against either Sao Tome and Principe or Mauritius away on 14 June. Super Eagles will next play Guinea-Bissau in a back-toback qualifier on September 19-27, 2022 with their last two qualifying games against holding in March 20-28, 2023 against Sierra Leone in Freetown before their last group game at home to either São Tomé and Príncipe or Mauritius. However, Nigeria will wait for CAF disciplinary decision on the protest by Mauritius against Sao Tome and Principe. According to Nigeria Football Federation Mauritius have a pending protest against São Tomé and Príncipe, who won their preliminary qualifying fixture, insisting that one São Tomé player had tested positive for covid-19. “The matter became somewhat more interesting because the player at the centre of the controversy is the one that scored the only goal of the match,” said our source. The two top-placed teams in each of the 12 groups at the end of the qualifying campaign will qualify for the 34th Africa Cup of Nations finals taking place in Cote d’Ivoire next year summer. However, hosts Cote d’Ivoire are definite qualifiers from Group H, meaning only one of Zambia, Comoros Islands and Lesotho will make it to the finals no matter the results garnered by the Ivoriens in the race.
