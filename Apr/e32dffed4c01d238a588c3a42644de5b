Undergraduates and gradu­ates in the country have been counseled to conceive and explore business ideas early, right from school, and not wait until family pressures begin to mount, saying it takes time for businesses to mature. Secretary to the Ogun State Government, Tokunbo Talabi, gave this advice as a guest lecturer at the First Personality Lecturer Series organised by the Department of Business Administration and Marketing of Babcock University, Ilishan Remo, noting that students must, as a matter of relevance, begin an experiment on business plans before leaving school, so as to make an impact in the economy. Talabi, while speaking to undergraduates and post­graduate audience listening physically and virtually, said youths must wake up to the reality of the unemployment rate in Nigeria, which now stands at 33.3 percent as of 2020 according to the Nigeria Bureau of Statistics (NBS), noting that youths must be­gin to imbibe entrepreneurial sense.
