Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp has ruled the club out of the Erling Haaland transfer saga set to take place this summer due to the reported price tag being too high, Fabrizio Romano reports. Romano goes on to state that Liverpool have never been in the race to sign Haaland despite Klopp being an admirer of the 21-year-old as a player and the decision to not enter the race is purely down to Liverpool’s transfer strategy. Speaking to German football magazine Sport Bild, the German manager said: “We will not be going near there. The figures being mentioned out there are crazy. We have nothing to do with them. No chance.”
