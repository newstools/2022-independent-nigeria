Lagos – President of the Professional Footballers Association of Nigeria (PFAN), Tijani Babangida, has called for a restructuring of the board of the Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) as the body is getting set for its next election in September. According to him, “the current structure is deficient on many fronts. The Chairmen of the state Football Associations dominate the structure to the detriment of other stakeholders. This does not portray football as the most democratic game in the world. He said that the dominance of the Exco by the Football Association Chairmen has its roots in the faulty nature of the composition and distribution of votes where the FA’s has 37 votes out of the 44 votes must be addressed if we must move forward. “There is no doubt that the structure of the Congress and the board has continuously promoted and encouraged election malpractices such as vote-buying with its negative effects on the quality of members of the board which robs quality decisions making and good governance,” he said. He is canvassing for a structure that is less cumbersome, less expensive, more democratic, and transparent and more inclusive of all major stakeholders based on equality. “What I mean is that we should adopt a system where the board is composed of representatives of only duly and democratically elected persons of the various stakeholders such as the Football Association, the leagues, the Players Union, Coaches Association, Nigeria Referees Association, Sportswriters Association, etc, who will now be responsible to elect the president of NFF and other key Officials amongst themselves.
