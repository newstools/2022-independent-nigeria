ABUJA – Former Chairman of Taraba State Chapter of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Chief Victor Bala Kona, has said he has support across the state to succeed the incumbent governor, Ishaku Darius. Speaking to newsmen after submitting his expression of interest and nomination forms at the party secretariat in Abuja to contest the Taraba state governorship election, Kona said nobody has anointed him. He said: “Nobody has anointed me, it is only God that crown leaders. You can see the calibre of people that are with me on this project, from all the local government areas of the state, even National Assembly members. This is to attest to the fact that I have support across the state.” Disclosing the strength of his campaign team, the governorship aspirant said, “my campaign team is made up of various professionals, business leaders and other stakeholders.” He boasted that with the achievement of the governor, Ishaku, the state will be easy for the party to reclaim in 2023. The aspirant, who said he has the support of Taraba women and youths, promised that if elected as governor he will boost the agricultural productivity of the state and work towards feeding the entire country. The former Chairman of Taraba State noted that the incumbent governor has reduced the menace of insecurity to the barest minimum, adding that the governor’s slogan of ‘Gives me peace and I will give you development’, has assisted in securing Taraba state. He said that he was committed to making sure that the prevailing peace is maintained.
