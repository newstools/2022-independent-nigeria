Ex Militant Group, Justice Freedom Movement of the Niger Delta has called on President Muhammadu Buhari to halt Operation Dakatar Da Barawo recently launched by the NNPC and the Nigerian Navy to curb oil theft and illegal refinery in the region expressing concern that it will heighten tension in the region. The Group in a statement by its spokesman, Wisdom Pere issued in Yenagoa, Bayelsa State said the Federal Government had always looked the other way when it comes to issues regarding the Niger Delta region as their only concern is the drilling of the region’s natural resources while the people live in perpetual fear and penury. ‘It’s mind-boggling that the Federal Government through the NNPC and the Nigerian Navy had procured 40 warships,5 helicopters and 200 gunboats as part of renewed efforts to intensify the fight against oil theft and illegal refineries in the region without considering the security implications” “The NNPC and international oil companies IOC are only interested in milking the region of its God-given natural resources at any cost without recourse to the people and the environment while the region’s development is at its lowest ebb”. “The billions of naira spent in the procurement of the 40 warships,5 helicopters and 200 gunboats is enough to engage youths, communities and stakeholders in the various communities in the Niger Delta on the security of oil pipelines and other critical oil assets within the length and breadth of the long-neglected region”. “The NNPC and Navy should look inward as regards those involved in oil theft in the Niger Delta region, they cannot absolve themselves for the menace to which the country is losing billions of naira daily”. “I urge President Muhammadu Buhari to rescind the decision of the Operation Dakatar Da Barawo in the Niger Delta region and engage youths and stakeholders on the solutions to oil theft and illegal refineries”.
