…Seeks Programme’s Institutionalization ABUJA – The Federal Capital Territory Administration (FCTA) has held discussions with food vendors, aggregators, relevant stakeholders, and the office of the Federal Ministry of Humanitarian Affairs, Disaster Management, and Social Development to facilitate the feeding of over 125 thousand school children. The interactive session, which took place on Wednesday at the LEA Primary School Jabi in Abuja came amid growing complaints from some food vendors about certain issues, particularly money and menus given to them, which were affecting the program. It would be recalled that the programme, which kicked off in 2019, is targeted at increasing the enrollment and nutritional value of pupils in public schools as well as empowering the downtrodden as a strategic survival venture. And in FCT, primary 1-3 pupils of 657 primary schools are involved in the programme. Speaking at the event, the FCT Focal person/ SA to FCT Minister of State on Social Investment Programme (SIP), Mrs Chinwendu Amba, noted that the programme started in FCT with the feeding of 81,000 plus children, but now there are a total of 125,000 plus children, and FCTA has written to the Ministry of the Humanitarian Affairs to capture the new number of children and schools in their next tranche of payment. She said most of the issues were resolved at the meeting, including the controversy trailing funds disbursement and purported payment of the approved additional N30 to the N70 feeding cost per pupil. She added that they have platforms where the administration interacts and disseminates vital information to those involved in the programme so that everybody should know what to do at any time, as well as desk officers to handle complaints.
