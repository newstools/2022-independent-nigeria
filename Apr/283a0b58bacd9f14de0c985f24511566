American comedian, actor, screenwriter, television producer, film producer, and director Chris Rock opened his first comedy show since being slapped by Will Smith onstage during the Oscars, performing to a sold-out crowd Wednesday at the Wilbur Theatre in Boston. The audience gave Rock a standing ovation that lasted about five minutes, according to attendees. Beyond his winking acknowledgment at the outset, Rock said that he is “still processing what happened,” but eventually he will talk about it. Before the show, the venue manager said that Rock was “in a great mood.” At the Oscars, Rock had made a joke about Smith’s wife, Jada Pinkett Smith, being in G.I. Jane 2, because of her bald head. But she has alopecia, which causes hair loss, and Smith didn’t take kindly to Rock’s words. Smith has since apologized to everyone involved; however, Rock’s brother said Smith had yet to reach out personally to the comedian. Despite Smith’s mea culpas, many continued to condemn his actions, including Oscars co-host Wanda Sykes, who called Smith’s actions “sickening.” On the same day Rock returned to stand-up, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, which awards the Oscars, announced that, after holding an emergency meeting on the matter, it had “initiated disciplinary proceedings” against Smith for violations of its code of conduct. His offenses were “inappropriate physical contact, abusive or threatening behavior and compromising the integrity of the Academy,” the group wrote in a statement, also revealing that he was asked to leave the Kodak Theatre following the altercation but declined. Smith, who collected the Best Actor award for King Richard following the incident, was given an opportunity to respond; members will vote April 18 on whether to suspend, expel or sanction him in another way.
