Rivers State Governor Nyesom Wike has said there is a need to invest in security intelligence in order to tame the unknown gunmen wreaking havoc in the South East. The governor who stated this in an interview with BBC Pidgin said fighting insecurity is beyond procuring weapons, urging the government to be proactive in tackling the challenges in the Southeast by prioritizing intelligence gathering. He said, “It is not just about procuring weapons for the security operatives, government needs to spend money on intelligence. When Russia was about to invade Ukraine, Ukrainian forces were not aware but America, because of their intelligence, alerted Ukraine. “You don’t need to wait till an incident occurs before you act. Governance is all about protecting lives and property, if you are not good at that, you have no business with the government. “If everybody is dead, who would use the infrastructure you are putting up”?
