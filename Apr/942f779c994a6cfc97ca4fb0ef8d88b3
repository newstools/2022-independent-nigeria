LAGOS – Speaker of the Lagos State House of Assembly, Right Honourable Mudashiru Obasa, has sent greetings to Christians in the State and Nigeria as they join the world in the celebration of this year’s Easter. In an Easter message released by his media office, Obasa noted the divine love of God for mankind as confirmed by the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ which is celebrated by Christians all over the world at Easter. He argued that such love, spread among neighbours, will help to put Nigeria in an enviable position among the comity of nations. According to Obasa, love comes before other considerations for a society’s existence or progress. “It is love that propels peace. It is love that makes leaders want to act right, it is love that helps the followers to live in unity. Even Jesus noted that loving your neighbour is one of the most important commandments of God. “It is love that will help us build faith in our country and grow it further from where it currently stands. With love, there can’t be cases of man’s inhumanity to man. “Just as Easter allows us to understand the importance of love and forgiveness, I want to urge Nigerians to celebrate the resurrection of Jesus with sober reflection on His virtues and the lessons He left behind,” Obasa said. The Speaker further urged Christians to use the opportunity of the celebration to pray for a better Nigeria, a peaceful 2023 election as well as divine wisdom for the leaders of the country. POLL He promised that the Lagos State House of Assembly will continue to promote peaceful co-existence among residents by passing pro-people laws, motions and resolutions.
