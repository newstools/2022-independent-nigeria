Tottenham Hotspur view Christian Eriksen as a less prominent target than Youri Tielemans due to the Dane’s age, according to a report from The Sun. Spurs are looking set to make a number of signings this summer. The Telegraph suggested that Antonio Conte wants six additions when the window opens. They have been linked with a host of names. Reports previously claimed that they are the side showing the most interest in signing Eriksen in light of his brilliant form for Brentford. Meanwhile, they are also said to be admirers of Tielemans ahead of the final year of his contract with Leicester. His asking price is reportedly £30 million. Eriksen is set to be a free agent. And obviously, he is someone who knows all about playing for Tottenham and Conte. So it may seem like a no-brainer for many. However, it seems that the 30-year-old may not be a top target for those behind the scenes at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium. The Sun reports that Eriksen is seen as a less prominent target than Tielemans. And it is suggested that it is his age that leaves Spurs less convinced about a move. POLL Plenty of Tottenham fans would be delighted if Eriksen returned. He is playing superbly for the Bees. And he could arrive on a free transfer. So it would baffle many if Spurs looked elsewhere. And the club would be under pressure to pull something special out of the bag if Eriksen did not come back. Signing Tielemans would be a positive move. He has been described as a ‘special‘ player. And he clearly has an enormous amount of potential. It says a lot that Spurs view him as a more important target than Eriksen.
