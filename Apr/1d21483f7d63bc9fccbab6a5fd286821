Senator Kabiru Marafa of Zamfara state has denied reports that he and ex-governor, Abdulaziz Yari have dumped the All Progressives Congress, APC for the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP. Marafa on Sunday evening during an Interview with Tambarin Hausa, said; “All we know is that we are into negotiations with many political parties that have invited us to join them in the state.” “…For now any news that said we have decamped is falsehood.” “All that I know is that there are lots of political parties, not only the PDP, that have invited us and wanting us to join and up till now we are still discussing with them.” “To the best of my knowledge up till now we have not reached a decision with anyone of them.…It is not true that we have decamped to the PDP, whoever said so has erred.” “In my capacity, I’m calling on people to discard any information about the issue from any person, until they hear from us,…We have not yet reached at any decisions.”
