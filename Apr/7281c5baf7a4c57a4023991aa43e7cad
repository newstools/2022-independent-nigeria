Tennis is certainly a global game, but for some, it takes much longer to find a route to promise land. Marcos Baghdatis has been at the forefront of tennis for so long that some might not remember his elongated path toward the upper ech­elon of the pro game. He was born in Cyprus, quickly became the best player in his country, and then had to leave to find better competition. While it pushed Baghdatis to new heights, it’s something he’s hoping to change in his post-playing career. Baghdatis spoke with Kamau Murray on this week’s Tennis.com Podcast about ev­erything from the journey, the climatic moments on court, and doing his best to help the next generation. Baghdatis left home at a young age to seek a life in pro tennis, and it was a com­mitment that really tested his passion for the sport. “Academies back then weren’t what they are now,” the Cypriot recalled. “I had to take the subway alone every morning. I missed my friends and family but I had a dream to play a Grand Slam main draw.” That goal was more than at­tained, as Baghdatis went on to reach a Top-10 ranking and make the fourth round or bet­ter at every Grand Slam event. But it was his greatest achievement in the majors that is also the source of his heaviestheartbreak. In 2006 at the tender age of 20, Bagh­datis went on an improbable run to the Australian Open fi­nal. Playing Roger Federer at arguably the peak of his pow­ers, Baghdatis won the first set and was neck and neck in the second. And that’s when he lost focus. “I started thinking about the future. And all of a sud­den, I hit three double faults, an unforced error, and he breaks me,” Baghdatis rec­ollected. “In any match, if you start thinking about the future and you’re not in the moment and at the present time, it slips away so fast and you cannot control it.”
