President Muhammadu Buhari has been urged to intervene in the conduct of the Local Government Council elections adopted in his home state, Katsina, saying “it is a sham”. Barrister Ibrahim Shehu Shema, former Governor of the state made this call in an interview with newsmen in Dutsinma, on Monday. “It’ll be a shame if the conduct of local government election cannot be done correctly, according to free, fair and equal opportunity to all Nigerians and Katsina people”. “From the report we have received, election materials left the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) between 8am to10am, and representatives of our party, the PDP, escorted these materials to the 34 local governments”. “But shockingly and amazingly, the arrival of these materials- you have seen it on social media, places like Kankara, Bakori and quite a number of other places; the materials either arrived and government is trying to cart them away”, he posited. “In a lot of places, like Mashi for example, the Returning Officer is a card carrying member of the APC, and on top of that, they took election material to the the polling units, but there are no result sheets”. Shema who expressed disappointment with the APC administration in the state, concluded that, “It is a sad testimony of APC’s administration in this country”.
