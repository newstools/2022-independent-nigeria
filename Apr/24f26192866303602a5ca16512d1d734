NNEWI  – A few days after the sugges­tion of an elder statesman, Chief Afe Babalola (SAN) calling for the suspension of the Nigerian constitu­tion and setting up of an interim administration to douse tension caused by insecurity before conduct­ing next year’s presidential election, Sir Silas Ikeh, an Igbo statesman and estate investor has called for the scrapping of the two na­tional assemblies—the Senate and House of Rep­resentatives. He said that the National Assemblies are nothing but a huge drain pipe for the na­tion’s scarce resources go­ing by their contribution to national development. Ikeh added that the huge resources being wasted on them should be channelled to youth’s development, creation of employment, provision of quality health care, education, etc. Canvassing for this po­sition while speaking with newsmen in his residence at new Haven Estate Nk­welle Ezunaka Oyi LGA last Friday, Ikeh berated the current leadership in the country led by Presi­dent Muhammadu Buhari and national legislators of showing gross insensitivity to the worsening condition of the masses on hardship, unemployment, insecurity, the collapse of the educa­tion sector, the higher fuel pump price, and corruption. In the 2023 presidency, he stated that equity demands that all geo-political zones should support an Igbo man to be president going by political permutations and wondered why other people from other zones like north and west are jos­tling for it adding that it is only an Igbo man that has the ability to put Nigeria right again. Said he, “it is the turn of Igbos from the southeast to rule Nigeria, others from other zones had taken it. Igbos are yet to be there because since after the civil war, people from the southeast should be given chance.”
