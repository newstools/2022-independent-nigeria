LAGOS  – The Lagos Chamber of Commerce and Industry (LCCI), has urged the Federal Government to consider immediate deregulation of the downstream sector of the oil and gas industry. The development was necessary due to public interest, President of the Chamber, Michael Olawale Cole, said in his recent review of the state of the economy. He raised eyebrow over the retention of petrol subsidy regime by the Federal Government. He said the continuous Russia-Ukraine war has triggered a positive oil price shock with spillover effects on operating costs, raw materials, and inflation in countries that are not directly engaged with the war. He added that Nigeria is not an exception as prices of goods and services are moving northward with the potential implication of shrinking production of goods and services. He said the worsening security challenges in many parts of the country are another serious threat to the agricultural and manufacturing value chain, which is capable of reducing production and contracting these sectors. “If the above conditions persist, production volumes will be impacted by the raw materials supply chain disruptions caused by the war in Ukraine, the rising cost of diesel, and other internal security crises. Job losses are also very likely due to constrained production and disrupted supply chains. All of these will likely depress growth potentials in Q2 2022.” Olawale-Cole added He said government that sustaining the pace of recovery in 2022 and navigating through the rising uncertainties in the global economy requires well-coordinated fiscal and monetary policies in promoting growth-enhancing and confidence-building policies that would encourage private and foreign capital inflows into the economy.
