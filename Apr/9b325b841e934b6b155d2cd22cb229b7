Akure – Vice President Yemi Osinbajo on Monday disclosed that he would be betraying Nigerians if he failed to contest for presidetnt in the 2023 general election. He stated this in Akure, the Ondo State capital, when he visited Governor Oluwarotimi Akeredolu to express his intention to succeed President Muhammadu Buhari in 2023. Osinbajo disclosed that he decided to contest for the presidency because he had learnt a lot and made many contacts both within the country and at international level. He admitted that he was given responsibilities by President Buhari to run the affairs of the nation as an acting president. The vice president disclosed that President Buhari only charged him to be fair and just while in charge. He, therefore, said the nation needed a serious service to get it out of the doldrums. According the vice president, “It’s an opportunity to be called to public service. This is most valuable thing we can add to our society. It’s a privilege to be called to serve. “Our country needs service to get it out of doldrums. I have declared my intention to contest as president. Nobody can be anything except God puts a stamp on it. “I chose to contest based on the fact that I have served as vice president. POLL I was given very serious responsibility. While in office, I got to find out many things and met many people and gained experience. “When I was given opportunity, President Buhari only told me to make sure you’re fair and just. “Knowing what I know, the contact, both nationally and internationally, it will be a betrayal to our country if I decide to retire to Lagos and write my memoir with all God has given to me. “I will be doing our country a great disservice and injustice. That’s why I threw my hat into the ring. “I will give this country the best I can with openness, transparency.”
