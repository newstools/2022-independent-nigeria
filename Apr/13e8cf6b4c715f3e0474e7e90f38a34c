The CONI Guarantee Board has ruled that Inter’s postponed match against Bologna must be played. The match between the Nerazzurri and the Rossoblu was originally scheduled to be played on January 6 at the Stadio Renato Dall’Ara in Bologna, but it was called off after Sinisa Mihajlovic’s side failed to turn up. The Bologna squad were struck with a COVID outbreak and their Local Health Authority refused to let them travel to the stadium. As announced by the Italian National Olympic Committee’s Guarantee Board, Inter’s appeal has been rejected and so they’ll have to play against Bologna on April 27. The same also for Atalanta, who made a similar appeal regarding their postponed match against Torino. The result of the match between Udinese and Atalanta, where Gian Piero Gasperini’s side won 6-2, was also confirmed. Finally, Lazio’s appeal to reduce the length of the ban applied to their two doctors following the COVID protocol violation was rejected.
