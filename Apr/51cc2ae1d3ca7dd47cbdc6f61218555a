Pakistan is currently in the midst of political upheaval. Prime Minister Imran Khan was faced with a vote of no-confidence vote on Sunday, which was expected to remove him from power. But before the vote could happen, it was thrown out by the deputy speaker. Khan then announced the dissolution of parliament. He insists that the push to oust him is a foreign conspiracy. We take a closer look. Sri Lanka is also facing a political crisis. This week, its president offered to share power with the opposition. The offer came after days of protests and calls for Gotabaya Rajapaksa and his family to step down. Anger has flared in the country over the government’s handling of the worst economic crisis in decades. Over the weekend, a state of emergency and a 36-hour curfew were declared. Finally, one gimmick to entice people out of their homes as the Covid-19 threat eases is “Shuttle In The Dark” badminton. It’s on offer at a fitness centre in the Petronas Twin Towers in the Malaysian capital Kuala Lumpur. The game is like normal badminton except that the court, clothes and equipment glow in the dark.
