The Federal Government has expressed its commitment to petroleum products sufficiency in the country. The development explains its acquisition of 20percent stake in Dangote Refinery, Minister of State for Petroleum Resources Chief Timipre Sylva said. He was quoted in a statement as saying that “the commitment of President Muhammadu Buhari in ensuring petroleum products sufficiency prompted his approval for Nigeria’s 20% stake in Dangote Refinery and the rehabilitation of the three nation’s refineries.” He implored Nigerians to give the government the benefit of the doubt in achieving the objectives of making Nigeria a better place for the citizens. He emphasised the need for Nigerians to continue to offer support for the success of the President Muhammadu Buhari led-government. He said Buhari government “is doing its best” in dealing with the security, economy and social challenges facing the country and appealed that “support, prayers and encouragement are the true ingredients we need to sustain Nigeria at this critical moment of our national life. Those beating the drum of war should desist from it because we have no other country but Nigeria.” He said: “We thank Nigerians for their patience and understanding during the last fuel scarcity. We share in your pains and we are putting measures in place to ensure that we overcome petroleum products scarcity in the country.” Sylva said “as a government we are committed to improving the welfare of the citizens and we plead with Nigerians to be patient with us. We pledge to deliver on our promises of a better Nigeria for our people and that we will do”.
