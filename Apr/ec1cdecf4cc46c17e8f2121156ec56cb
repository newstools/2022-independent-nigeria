WARRI – A chieftain of the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) in Delta State, Hon Daniel Omimi, has lauded the ster­ling leadership quality of Senator Iyorchia Ayu, Na­tional Chairman of the par­ty, insisting that the party is better organised now to face any opposition in the 2023 generation elections. Omimi, a political ad­viser to Governor Ifeanyi Okowa, is highly elated that the party made up of persons of credible char­acter, is ready to sweep the polls in the next political dispensation. The PDP stalwart known for his unflinching support for the Governor and the PDP family, made these re­marks when he addressed the press yesterday in War­ri. According to him, PDP, one of the biggest political parties in Africa was lucky to have a former Senate President and tested poli­tician as the national chair­man who is ready to move the party forward. “Interestingly, PDP has got all it takes to wrestle power from the ailing APC that has thrown Nigeria into deeper woes and pan­demic situation,” lamented the PDP strong man. He, however, advised APC to start packing its bag and baggage from the Aso Rock as they have woe­fully disappointed Nigeri­ans and the people are also tired of them. On Senator Ayu, the PDP chieftain further described the National Chairman as a winner, calm and resolute person who knows his on­ions. “My honest advice to APC is to try as much as possible to clear the mess they have caused Nige­ria into deeper woes and hunger before they quit in 2023”, stressed Hon. Omimi stated.
