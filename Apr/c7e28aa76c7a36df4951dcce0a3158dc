Barcelona and Ronald Araujo have finally settled on a mutual agreement until 2026 and the team hopes to finalise every formality in the coming days. As reported by the Spanish news outlet SPORT, Barcelona could make an official announcement as soon as next week. As of today, while the agreement is in place, documents are been formalised to be reviewed and signed by everyone involved. The appraisal of Araujo is carefully fortified by inserting a whopping €1000 million (€1 billion) worth of the termination clause, something which was also done for the likes of Pedri and Ansu Fati too. Barcelona and Araujo have been negotiating since early January. The team had, in fact, put forward as many as two proposals in the past, but the numbers mentioned were too south of the defender’s liking. As it turns out, though, the parties have finally managed to settle on a middle ground which is mostly due to the fact that the defender himself has no interest in leaving the team. He is very much grateful for the fact that Barcelona put their money on him at such young age, and manager Xavi has also been a positive influence as he has only pushed him to be the future leader of the pack. Seeing Araujo’s tricky situation, the Uruguayan had plenty of offers at his disposal, and Barça knew if it was for money, he could have left in the summer itself. And with a valid contract until 2023, the team could have received a high transfer fee too. But everyone, including the defender himself, knew that wasn’t to be. Araujo’s priority was and will always be Barcelona since he understands those sitting in the management offices see him as a leader for the future. POLL And it goes without saying that the 23-year-old made some adjustments as well, as his new contract will be divided into fixed and variable pay, which has more or less convinced the defender to put pen to paper.
