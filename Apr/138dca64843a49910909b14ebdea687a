ABUJA – An academic don and professor of Economics, National Open University of Nigeria (NOUN), Ganiyat Adejoke Adesina-Uthman, has said prevailing social-economic constraints may necessitate the government’s implementation of child spacing policies if the high population growth rate is to be curtailed. Adesina-Uthman gave the suggestion in Abuja on Tuesday, while presenting the (NOUN)19th inaugural lecture, where she noted that implementation of the programme will help in reducing infant, child, and maternal mortality rate as well. She spoke on the theme, “What Has Finance Got To Do With It?” urging the government to design an appropriate population policy to address the challenges of high population rates and their consequences. She said, “Since rapid population growth rates have the likelihood of causing man’s demand on the environment to exceed its natural regenerative and absorptive capacity; child spacing programme for example should be implemented.” The Professor further said poverty alleviation, equality, and justice, reducing the wide gaps between the haves and the haves-not, among others, can be achieved through alternative financing from revealed knowledge through the Islamic economic system since there has been too much gaming of capitalism. She added, “Finance drives growths and growths drive more financing. However, linking the real sector with the financial sector is imperative. Migrating from financial capitalism to financial socialism which is the basis of Islamic economics is again hereby, recommended for individuals, corporations and governments at all levels.” In a remark, the Vice-Chancellor of the university Prof. Olufemi Peters explained that the lecture was a custom in the institution, where at one time an academic is called upon to give an account of his or her stewardship.
