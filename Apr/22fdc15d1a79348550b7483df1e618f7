Alisson pulled off an audacious Cruyff turn which sent Bruno Fernandes “back to Manchester” in Liverpool’s clash with United. The goalkeeper had the ball at his feet in his 18-yard box with Fernandes pressing him, but remained cool, calm and collected to skill his way out of a potentially dangerous situation and leave the United attacker with egg on his face. Liverpool fans lapped the moment up on Twitter with one joking: “Alisson sending Bruno Fernandes back to Manchester there.” Another Red was in total awe, writing: “I want to be as cool as Alisson Becker.” And even Gary Lineker added his praise. “Alisson has been better than any @ManUtd player,” the legendary England striker posted to his followers. A fan similarly said: “Alisson could play for Man Utd and realistically be their best midfielder I’m not even joking.” However, while Alisson didn’t break a sweat, some of those watching on found his fire playing too much to handle. “I love you Alisson. But stop messing with my heart,” wrote one with a laughing emoji.
