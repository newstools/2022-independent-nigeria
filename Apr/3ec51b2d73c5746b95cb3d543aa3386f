China and the EU should form a relationship that can act as a stabilizing force in a turbulent world, President Xi Jinping has told EU leaders, according to Chinese media. In a call with EU Commission president Ursula von der Leyen and EU Council president Charles Michel, Xi said the conflict in Ukraine strengthened the urgency for developing deeper ties between the two powers. In the first summit between the leaders in two years, Xi said the EU needed to take an independent view of its ties with Beijing to foster global peace and development, according to the reports. For their part, EU leaders said they had pressed China not to aid Moscow militarily or economically. “We made it very clear that China should, if not support the sanctions, at least do everything not to interfere in any kind,” von der Leyen told a press conference. She refused to answer questions on how Xi had responded. She described the EU’s relationship with China as “manifold”, noting that there were constructive areas, competitive areas, and areas of “clear rivalry”. Other topics discussed during the call were the pandemic, climate change, trade relations, and human and labor rights, von der Leyen said.
