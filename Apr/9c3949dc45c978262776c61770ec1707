The Warri South Local Government Chief Security Officer, who was irked by the ugly development, in a statement released Thursday night, stressed that, “hooliganism, cultism, drug addiction and illegal possession of firearms, must be stopped immediately.” According to the council boss, “I condemn in totality, the recent cult clash in Warri, which claimed at least two lives. It is barbaric and inhuman, to kill fellow human beings under any guise. “The spate of hooliganism, drug addiction and illegal possession of firearms by the cultists, have instilled fear in residents. Operations of members of the cult gangs, must be stopped immediately by the security agencies. They should beef up surveillance in Warri South Local Government Area, especially the flash points, to prevent further killings,” Dr. Tidi cautioned. “While praying for the repose of the souls of the persons who lost their lives as a result of the cult clash, l commiserated with families of the deceased and people living in the areas where the unfortunate incidents occurred. POLL “At least two persons were reportedly killed by rival groups between last week and yesterday evening at two different locations in the heart of Warri.” Dr. Tidi, said, “the avoidable loss of lives, especially among the youths, was troubling, tasking the security agencies to fish out those responsible for the cult killings, to ensure they face the full weight of the law.”
