Peseiro is no stranger to Afri­can football as he had previous­ly taken a short stint in Egypt coaching African champions Al Ahly. Despite his short time with the Reds, his numbers were impressive, playing 12 games, winning 8, drawing two, and suffering two defeats. However, Peseiro decided to leave Cairo to take the then-va­cant head coach position at Portuguese giants FC Porto, before he was sacked after just 22 games. POLL Panathinaikos, CD Nacional, Rapid Bucharest, UAE’sAl-Wah­da and Sharjah FC, Vitória de Guimarães, and most recently the Venezuelan national team among the notable names he coach during his long manage­rial career.
