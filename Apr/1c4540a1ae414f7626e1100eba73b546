April 6 celebrates National Siamese Cat Day. The event which started in 2014 as part of an animal lover’s quest was used to encourage the adoption of shelter cats. The holiday was created by Jace Shoemaker- Galloway, an author and former freelance writer who made a career out of writing about various holidays and ended up creating some of her own. Shoemaker-Galloway declared April 6, 2014, to be the first annual National Siamese Cat Day. She said she wanted the holiday to raise awareness of the plight of cats in animal shelters and encourage people to adopt the felines.
