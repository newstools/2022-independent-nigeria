ASABA – The confidence of the organised private sector in Delta State has been bolstered to take advantage of the Employees Compensation Scheme (ECS) by the Federal Government. At a roundtable with stakeholders in Asaba, the Nigeria Social Insurance Trust Fund (NSITF) assured leaders of several trade groups of the security, sustainability and transparency of the ECS. While addressing the concerns raised during the roundtable, a regional manager of NSITF, Arc ThankGod Max-Egba said that the ECS was designed to guard against occupational mishaps and help the worker remain safe, healthy and productive. He explained that the funds contributed by the policyholder would be domiciled with the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), adding that the operations of the scheme were strictly guided by an Act of the National Assembly. Meanwhile, the Principal Manager in charge of the Informal Sector Department of the NSITF, Mr. Chigozie Nwaobilor said that the ECS was expanded to accommodate the informal sector that contributes approximately 70 per cent of revenue to the nation’s economy. While encouraging the stakeholders to appreciate the scheme, Nwaobilor said that the Federal Government was obligated to compensate policyholders who suffered occupational hazards or loss of productivity based on stipulated terms and conditions. Among other benefits, Nwaobilor said that the ECS premium would be calculated based on the holder’s monthly earnings, adding that the scheme would cater for the holder’s next of kin in the case of death. On how to key into the scheme, Nwaobilor said that prospective policyholders in the informal sector would be registered through their union leaders, or have tendered all supporting documents and fulfilled all qualifications. POLL The stakeholders’ meeting was graced by trade union leaders in the transport, fashion and cosmetics, market men and women, automobile sectors as well as the media.
