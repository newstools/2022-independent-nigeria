Napoli captain Lorenzo Insigne was distraught after the 1-1 draw with Roma doomed their Scudetto hopes, saluting the home fans in tears. His penalty had given them the lead just 11 minutes in at the packed Stadio Diego Armando Maradona. However, coach Luciano Spalletti’s decisions will come under fire, as he decided to substitute all his attacking players to defend the one-goal lead. It didn’t work, as Stephan El Shaarawy scored the 91st-minute equaliser. The final whistle arrived to jeers from the crowd, who saw their team once again fumble a lead in a big game on home turf and choke just when the Serie A title seemed within reach. Coming off the back of a heavy home defeat to Fiorentina, this was a devastating blow and Insigne burst into tears. He was the last player to leave when Napoli saluted their supporters, well aware his chance at silverware had gone in his final season with the club. Insigne has already signed with MLS club Toronto FC from July 1, when he will be a free agent.
