While Juventus fans complain that Joao Cancelo was sold to Manchester City too soon, the reasons behind his departure after just one season are revealed. The Portugal international right-back was purchased from Valencia in 2018 for €40m and sold a year later for €65m, making a very healthy profit on that investment. He has since gone from strength to strength at Manchester City, being one of the most impressive players in this weekend’s 2-2 Premier League draw with Liverpool. This has prompted Juve fans on social media to debate their own difficulties with the right-back role since Cancelo’s departure, wondering if coach Max Allegri was to blame. However, reports from Juventus-focused journalists Max Nerozzi and Fabiana Della Valle insist it was a club-wide evaluation of Cancelo that prompted the decision to sell. In fact, they went so far as to suggest the Portuguese right-back was tactically naïve, continued to make the same defensive errors and was showing no signs of improvement. Another report maintains Cancelo had already asked agent Jorge Mendes to find him a new club before Juve decided to fire Allegri.
