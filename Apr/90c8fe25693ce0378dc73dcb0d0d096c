A member of the Federal House of Representatives, Hon. Bolaji Yusuf Ayinla has advised every Nigerian who is yet to get registered for the Permanent Voter’s Card (PVC), to take advantage of the ongoing registration being presently conducted by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC). Ayinla, who stated this at a stakeholders’ meeting held on Sunday at his Mushin Constituency 2 Office in Lagos, assured Nigerians that the newly amended Electoral Act will give Nigerians a free, fair and credible election in 2023 and beyond. The lawmaker, while explaining that the only way to elect credible leaders is to participate in the process that will bring about electing such leaders, reassured that the 2023 general elections will bring about the change that Nigerians have been yearning for. According to him, the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) had improved the electoral process, and the new electoral act will contribute positively to the credibility of elections. “With the new electoral act, a lot of things will change about our electoral process. INEC has also stepped up its game. “This simply means that the era where people feel their votes don’t count is over. So, every eligible voter who has attained the age of 18, should go and obtain their voter cards to enable them to participate fully in the 2023 general election. “Your voter card is your power. It will enable you to vote for credible and good leaders that will move the nation forward. “For those who do not vote, they have already voted by allowing a few to determine the future of the majority. The argument that INEC or other agents may not make our votes count is no longer acceptable. We must exercise our right to vote and then speak to protect our vote. POLL “I am using this medium to call on all Nigerians to get their Permanent Voters Card and get ready to vote for the kind of leaders that is capable of leading Nigeria to the Promised Land,” he added.
