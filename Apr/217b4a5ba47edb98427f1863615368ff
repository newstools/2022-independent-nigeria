Ten Governorship aspirants of the All Progressives Congress (APC) have called for a genuine reconciliation and forgiveness among members in the state to ensure that the party emerges victorious in the Governorship and other elections in 2023. In a communique jointly signed by the ten aspirants in Port Harcourt, Rivers State capital on Monday, they encouraged all those interested for the governorship to go about their consultations peacefully devoid of name-calling, insults and pulling down of one another to gain attention. The Progressives Aspirants enjoined the leadership of the party in the state to accord everybody a level playing field during the primaries for fairness, equity and sense of belonging. As a way of respecting the party supremacy, the aspirants resolved to collapse their political structures and support to whoever will emerge as the party’s flag bearer to win the 2023 Governorship in the state. After series of consultations and interactions, the aspirants agreed to consult other Stakeholders in Rivers state to “support power rotation to the Riverine-Ijaw” in 2023 as a way of ensuring equity, justice and fairness in the distribution of political offices. Under the aegis of Progressives Aspirants Forum, PAF, the ten Aspirants expressed their unalloyed loyalty to President Muhammadu Buhari and the Minister of Transportation, Rotimi Amaechi, in particular, for his bold declaration to run for the office of the President next year. “We commend him for his courage to declare his interest to run for the office of President in the 2023 Elections”. Some of the aspirants who signed the communique include Dr. Dakuku Peterside, Dr. Dawari George, Prince Tonye Princewill, Architect Tonye Cole, Hon Ojukaye Flag Amachree among others.
