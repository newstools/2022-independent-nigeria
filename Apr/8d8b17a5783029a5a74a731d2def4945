Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp has sung the praises of Benfica striker Darwin Nunez ahead of their Champions League quarter-final second leg. The German head coach believes the Uruguayan has a “big career” ahead of him as he continues to be touted for a move away from Portugal this summer. Manchester United are among the clubs linked with the 22-year-old as their torrid season continued with defeat to Everton on Saturday. Interim boss Ralf Rangnick has previously outlined the ‘obvious’ need for an addition in the striking department, with Edinson Cavani set to leave and others, potentially, as well. And ahead of Liverpool’s Champions League second-leg against Benfica, Klopp has pre-empted a race for Nunez’s signature. He said in his press conference: “Extremely good looking boy and a decent player. Really, really good player I have to say. “I knew him before of course but he played pretty much in front of me with tough battles with Ibou Konate. Strong, quick, looked calm with his finish. “Good, really good. Like I say in these situations, if he stays healthy, he has a big career ahead of him.” West Ham were among the club vying for his services in January but reportedly saw their efforts rebuffed. And should United make a move, they have already been told a potential ballpark figure for the goalscorer who has 31 goals in all competitions this season.
