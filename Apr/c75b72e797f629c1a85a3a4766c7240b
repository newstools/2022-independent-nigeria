LAGOS – Governor Bala Mohammed of Bauchi State and presidential hopeful on the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in 2023 has said that he will withdraw his aspiration if former President Goodluck Jonathan decides to run for president under any political party.  The Governor who spoke on Arise Television said that he made the statement at the beginning of the process, stressing that as somebody who has a deep sense of gratitude for President Jonathan, he would never disrespect him. “I became a Minister by God’s wish through him. I came to limelight in Nigeria through former President Jonathan. I have never left him for one minute. He is my boss and mentor, and I respect him so much. “In whichever party that he would run, I said that I won’t run. I don’t want to be like some people after been mentored by someone laboriously they will despise the person. He kept me in FCT for six years,” he said Mohammed added, “I told him, and he even ask me to go ahead and I told him that if he is running that I won’t run. I have had some permutations here and there, of those who wish him to run. Of course we have come to a level where I have gone too far and I am even having an appointment to see him and find out the truth because he is going to put some of us in a very difficult condition. “I am a person of honour and integrity. I am a person of my words and I won’t want to swallow them, but at the same time I wouldn’t want him to be used to stop me by those who have been planning to do that. “He is an eminent democrat who believes in mentoring. If he is running I won’t run. I will go back to my elders and tell them, but certainly I will do a lot of leg walk if I am withdrawing. I have that respect for him forever and it will linger up to the time that I am no more. I respect people who have a hand in determining what I have become and certainly Jonathan is somebody I won’t disrespect for whatever reason,” the Governor said.
