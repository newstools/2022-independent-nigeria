LAGOS – Speak Out 24/7, a pro democracy non government organisation has described as unguided and inciting, a statement from the Muslim Rights Concern (MURIC), that calls for a Muslim to succeed Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu in 2023.In a well circulated and widely reported statement entitled, “Lagos 2023: Don’t rob Peter to pay Paul,” MURIC Director, Professor Ishaq Akintola expressed the view that, Christians have had their two terms and so, it is the turn of Muslims to produce next governor by 2023 to succeed the sitting governor, Sanwo-Olu.According to a statement signed by Comrade Adekunle Adeosun on behalf of Speak Out 24/7, such a statement is not expected from a respected cleric and university don at this point in time when all hands are expected to be on deck for religious tolerance and peaceful co-existence among the citizenry.The NGO, floated to advocate for good governance and democracy sustenance said, “it is high time our religious leaders, academic gurus and community heads worked towards the unity, progress and development of the society,” wondering, “how people of high calibre like Professor Akintola could be engaging in an exercise that could be viewed as divisive and intolerant”The statement further reminded that, “Lagos State, a mini Nigeria, is never an enclave of religious bigotry, ethnic sentiment or political hatred,” cautioning that, “all commentators, political observers and opinion moulders should weigh their utterances well before feeding the public to avoid a situation where their good intentions could be misconstrued for incitement.”While admitting that, democracy gives all and sundry liberty to ventilate their views and opinion, he however admonished that, views and the opinions to be so expressed, must be the ones that would give room for healthy and robust discuss for the benefit of the citizenry irrespective of their creed, religion, political parties or ethnic leaning.He urged the public to treat Professor Akintola’s statement on the lighter mood and allow it to pass as part of freedom for ventilation of ideas cautioning that, “taking it more serious may likely heat up the polity unnecessarily which will not augur well for the society.”Democracy, according to the NGO, is about spreading its dividends to all the door steps of the good and even bad people of the society without consideration for their places of worship or their faith affiliation, believing that, any person, who can fit into that bracket should be given the mandate to govern without being sentimental about his/her religious belief.
