GoNigeria, in line with its stated objective of becom­ing an important voice for driving Nigerian youths to actively participate in the nation’s electoral processes and redefining the political trajectory of Nigeria in 2023, has launched the GoNige­ria Comedy Challenge, a contest for young Nigerians between the ages of 18 to 34, with incentives ranging from N1,000,000 for the 1st prize winner. Other prizes include N600,000 and N400,000 for the first and second runners-up respectively. Propelled by the enormous resourcefulness of talents and skills that abound in the creative space among Nigeri­an youths, GoNigeria is seek­ing to harness this energy plus the anger in the minds of some youths in a positive direction. These GoNigeria compe­titions act as an incentiviz­ing platform that also boosts political participation by Nigerian youths as the mes­saging requires participants to go beyond cracking jokes, to showcase their entertain­ment talents, by delivering an important message through comedy that is consistent with the ongoing GoNigeria advocacy campaign. GoNige­ria believes that many true words are often said in jest.
