Committee saddled with the distribution of Ramadan Relief package in Gombe State has commenced the conveyance of food stuff to the designated centres in the 11 Local Government Areas for onward distribution to individuals, groups and associations as directed by Governor Muhammadu Inuwa Yahaya. The committee was at the Gombe Central Store to supervise the dispatch exercise to all the 11 LGA’s and subsequent distribution in all the 114 wards of the State. Speaking at the event, the Chief of Staff, Government House, Abubakar Inuwa Kari said the directive by Governor Yahaya was done in the spirit of the holy month of Ramadan. He said, “As you can see the vehicles are being loaded to the various Local Government Areas for onward distribution to the beneficiaries. “Clubs and associations are equally here to pick their consignment; so I am here to ensure that the distribution goes as planned and those charged with the responsibility execute it to the later”, he stated. According to him, the gesture of distributing food items has been a trademark of the present administration of Governor Muhammadu Inuwa Yahaya covering both faiths, especially during religious rites.
