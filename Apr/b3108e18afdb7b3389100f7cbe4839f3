Mikel Arteta’s Arsenal could send William Saliba out on loan again for next season, but the defender will have to sign a contract extension, according to Jeunes Footeux. The report in the French news outlet has claimed Arsenal could send Saliba back on loan to Marseille again, but they have told the young defender that he will have to sign an extension to his current deal. The 21-year-old defender, who cost Arsenal £27 million (Sky Sports), is under contract at the North London club until the summer of 2024. In our opinion, if Saliba, who was recently praised by Paris Saint-Germain and France international forward Kylian Mbappe, wants to have a long-term future at Arsenal, then he will have to stay at the Emirates Stadium next season. There is no point in the France international centre-back – described as “quick and a good passer of the ball” by former Arsenal midfielder Samir Nasri on Marseille’s official YouTube in 2021 – going out on loan yet again, especially back to Ligue 1. If Saliba is to impress the Arsenal chiefs and manager Mikel Arteta, then he needs to be at London Colney and train with the first team.
