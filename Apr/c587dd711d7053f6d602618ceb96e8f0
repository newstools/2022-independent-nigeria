AC Milan have reportedly withdrawn from the race for Chelsea star Romelu Lukaku. Lukaku was linked to the Italian club in recent weeks by GOAL journalist Nizaar Kinsella. However, according to Gazzetta Dello Sport (via MilanNews), this transfer has no chance of happening, with the board at Milan planning to focus on young Italian players in their recruitment. Lukaku has struggled since moving back to England, so it’s no surprise that Milan don’t want to take a risk on him. The cost to sign Lukaku from Chelsea is likely to be a hefty one, after the London club paid a whopping £97.5m for him last summer, according to Sky Sports. Chelsea will want to try and recoup some of the money they paid for the Belgian, otherwise, they will have made a significant loss and gained very little from his performances. The 28-year-old has only managed five goals in 22 games this season, despite managing 24 goals in 36 games for Inter Milan the season before. It will be interesting to see if Thomas Tuchel decides to keep the striker next season and continue to play Kai Havertz in a centre-forward role.
