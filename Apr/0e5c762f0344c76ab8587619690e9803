As Nigerians joined the rest of the world to mark the resurrection of Jesus Christ, the People’s Democratic Party (PDP), has urged Nigerians to keep hope alive and resist the agent of death. The party also urged Nigerians to use the occasion of Easter to rekindle their hope for a brighter future and a national rebirth under a coming democratic and people-oriented government. PDP, in a statement by its spokesman, Hon. Debo Ologunagba said “Easter, the celebration of the victory of life over death, offers us the opportunity to further strengthen our resolve to rescue our dear nation from the forces of death, suffering and misrule that have held her hostage in the last seven years. “Such forces have in the last seven years divided and suppressed Nigerians, arrogantly instituted lies, propaganda, deceit, disregard for the Rule of Law, intimidation and violation of human rights as official policies of State; brought untold economic hardship and acute poverty as a weapon of suppression and mass destruction, pillaged our national treasury with impunity, opened our nation to terrorists and look the other way as outlaws take over territories and daily massacre our citizens. “It is saddening that millions of Nigerians are celebrating Easter in utter misery, lack, social displacement and agony of bereavement due to the current misrule in our country. “Nigerians must therefore not resign to despondency in the face of life-discounting experiences that they encounter daily under the current administration but reinforce their determination to unite and use their votes to democratically end the regime of failure and give our nation a new lease of life, come 2023. “Our Party further charges all compatriots to bolster unity, love and care for one another at this time in the renewed hope in God, as we collectively resolve to Rescue and Rebuild our nation from misrule.” The party, however, prayed for the nation and wishes all compatriots a happy Easter celebration.
