Vice President Kamala Harris will speak at the Coast Guard Academy’s commencement ceremony, according to a Friday announcement by school officials. “We are honored to host the Vice President and look forward to having her present the Coast Guard’s newest leaders with their commissions,” Rear Adm. Bill Kelly, the Coast Guard Academy’s superintendent, said. “This will also be a memorable moment for our graduates before they head out across the country and around the globe to take their places in the fleet.” Harris is slated to give the keynote address to graduates in New London, Connecticut, on May 18, according to the Coast Guard Academy’s release. It is a tradition for vice presidents to speak to the graduating classes at federal service academies, and this will be the first time Harris will visit the Coast Guard Academy, according to a report. Harris gave the keynote address to graduates at the United States Naval Academy last year. President Joe Biden addressed last year’s class of graduates at the Coast Guard Academy and told them, “The best way to meet the wide array of threats we meet today is by investing in America’s enduring advantages.”
