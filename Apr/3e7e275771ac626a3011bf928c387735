The Barcelona Open (cur­rently sponsored by Banc Sabadell) is an annual tennis tournament for male professional play­ers. The event has been held in Barcelona, Spain every year from 1953 (ex­cept for its cancellation in 2020), and is played on clay courts at the Real Club de Tenis Barcelona. This year’s edition will serves off on Monday, April 18 to end on Sunday, April 24. It was an event of the Grand Prix tennis circuit from 1970–1989, except in 1971 when it was part of the World Championship Tennis (WCT) circuit, al­though it was also open to non-WCT players. The tournament is cur­rently part of the Associa­tion of Tennis Profession­als (ATP) Tour 500 series on the ATP Tour. It is also known as Torneo Godó, Trofeo Conde de Godó, and Open Banc Sabadell. It is Spain’s second most important tourna­ment on the ATP Tour af­ter the Madrid Open and the event generally takes place in the last week of April, when temperatures in Barcelona average a daily high of 19 °C (66 °F). Native Spaniard Rafael Nadal has won the singles title a record twelve times (2005, 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2016, 2017, 2018, and 2021), and in 2017 the center court of the Real Club de Tenis Barce­lona was renamed Pista Rafa Nadal (Rafa Nadal Arena).
