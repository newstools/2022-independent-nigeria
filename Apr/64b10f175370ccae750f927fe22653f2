As the country prepares for another headcount in April 2023, the former Military Administrator of Kaduna State, Colonel Abubakar Dangiwa Umar (retd), has called on President Muhammadu Buhari to suspend the proposed National census billed for April 2023 and instead concentrate on tackling the insecurity confronting the country. Dangiwa Umar, the Chairman of the Movement for Unity and Progress (MUP), in a statement issued on Friday described the idea of conducting a census as shocking when the country’s stability is shaking. “Nigeria is facing existential challenges caused by insecurity and a collapsing economy, embarking on a census would amount to a misadventure and waste of scarce resources. Uma urged the federal government to suspend the planned census and focus its energies on securing the nation as well as conducting the 2023 elections. The statement reads as follows: “The decision of the FGN to seek and get the approval of the National Council of State to conduct the National census in April 2023 must have come as a great shock to most well-meaning Nigerians. “A country that is facing existential challenges such as unprecedented level of insecurity, the collapsing economy cannot have as one of its priorities the conduct of a National census. “We, therefore, urge the Buhari administration to suspend what will amount to misadventure and waste of scarce national resources. “This Administration should focus all its attention on securing the nation and conducting the 2023 elections. POLL “A National census at this point is certainly not a priority assuming that its conduct is possible,” he stressed.
