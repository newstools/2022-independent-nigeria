Following a hard-fought victory against Real Sociedad, Barcelona get ready to host Rayo Vallecano at the Camp Nou for gameweek 34 of La Liga. The reverse fixture of this clash eventually proved to be the final plug in Ronald Koeman’s tenure at Barça. Ahead of the game, Xavi has selected 23 players that will are likely to be involved for the clash, featuring a bunch of good news. Gerard Pique, Ronald Araujo, and Dani Alves were substituted off against Sociedad due to injuries, but have been included in the list. While Pique was spotted training alone, Araujo and Alves participated in regular group activities. Jordi Alba suffered an injury scare as well, but has eventually been ruled fit enough for this game. Ansu Fati, Pedri, Sergi Roberto, and Samuel Umtiti are the only players still sidelined due to injury. Unfortunately, Pedri’s return is deemed over as it stands, while Fati, Roberto, and Umtiti could return to action vs RCD Mallorca next weekend.
