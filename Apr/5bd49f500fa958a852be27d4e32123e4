The Socio-Economic Rights and Accountability Project, SERAP, has urged President Muhammadu Buhari to take steps toward ending the strike by the Academic Staff Union of Universities, ASUU. According to SERAP, Federal Government is denying poor Nigerians access to education by failing to end the lingering ASUU strike. SERAP in a series of tweets via its Twitter handle said, “BREAKING: We urge President Buhari to immediately take steps to end the lingering ASUU strike and get the students back to school. “By failing to prevent and end the strike action by ASUU, the Buhari administration is denying poor children equal access to higher education.” Recall that ASUU embarked on a one-month warning strike on February 14th and extended it by another two months, over the alleged failure of the government to fulfill its agreements.
