A former senator, Shehu Sani, has praised the Nigerian Women’s Team for defeating Ghana in the cricket games on Friday. He disclosed this on Saturday in a tweet, lamenting that no one is talking about their victory as everyone is focused on only Football. Sani wrote, “Nigerian women team beat Ghana in Cricket yesterday and no one is talking about it, only football.” Recall that Nigerian male football team, Super Eagles were unable to qualify for the Qatar 2022 World Cup after losing to Ghana in a 1-1 draw on away-goal rule.
