Pep Guardiola will be hoping to have John Stones back when Manchester City welcome Atletico Madrid to the Etihad on Tuesday night. It’s the first leg of the Champions League quarter-final tie, with Atletico having knocked out Manchester United in the previous round and they now turn their attentions to another English team Stones, who picked up a knock while on international duty with England, was an unused substitute against Burnley, and it remains to be seen whether he is fit for European action. One centre-back definitely out is Ruben Dias, with Guardiola confirming before the Burnley match that he would still be out for another couple of weeks. “I don’t know how long, the doctor said four to six weeks,” Guardiola said. “Ruben is on week four now, first of March he was injured, four weeks later, I think we need two weeks more.” Kyle Walker is also unavailable, as he completes his three-match suspension after picking up a red card in City’s final group-stage match against RB Leipzig. That may see Joao Cancelo shift to the right of the defence, with Oleksandr Zinchenko coming in at left-back. POLL As ever, Guardiola has a number of options in attacking areas. Bernardo Silva is expected to come back into the side, while Riyad Mahrez will be hoping to earn a start in place of either Raheem Sterling or Jack Grealish. Predicted Man City XI: Ederson; Cancelo, Laporte, Stones, Zinchenko; Rodri, Silva, De Bruyne; Mahrez, Foden, Sterling
