Mountain of Fire and Mir­acles Minis­tries (MFM) Football Club have play­ers but they lack motiva­tion. This is the submission of a player of the club who spoke to our corre­spondent. The player who was angry said that the major challenge facing the former CAF Cham­pions League campaign­ers remains lack of mo­tivation and low morale among the players. “We have the players who are ready to play and rescue the club but where do you hope to start when we are not motivated? “The players and I feel even the coaches here have low morale to push for results; yes I know a lot of things may not be well with the structure but it has more to do with the way players are treat­ed as if they can carry on without adequate pay,” the player lamented. Speaking on the con­dition of the Nigeria Professional Football League generally, he said the league has seen some improvements but regret­ted that the major snag remains the poor welfare package. “The league is improv­ing there is no doubt about that. “But we have to ad­dress this issue of play­ers always demonstrating because they are not paid. “Some of us are bread winners and when we are denied, everything lacks at home. POLL “If we can address this and the players are paid, I am telling you the league will produce better play­ers and clubs will also do better outside,” he said. MFM, who have played in both CAF Champions League and CAF Confed­eration Cup are reeling at the base of the table with 23 points from 24 matches. Barring a mir­acle, the Olukoya Boys will certainly go down at the end of the season and the development has been blamed on the poor running of the club.
