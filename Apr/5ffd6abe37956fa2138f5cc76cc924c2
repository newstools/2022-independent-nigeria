LAGOS – The Aso family and other well-meaning Nigerians have appealed to the Board and Management of the Lagos State University Teaching Hospital (LASUTH), Ikeja, Lagos, to settle out of court as a result of the assault that happened in the Surgical Emergency Unit of the hospital on December 24, 2021. A statement released from the office of the Chief Medical Director, Professor Adetokunbo O. Fabamwo, stated that Mr. Reginald Uwandu and Aso Family on Friday, December 24, 2021 in a national newspaper accused the hospital of negligence and demanded for a public apology after physically assaulting medical personnel on duty that fateful day. He said the report was seen to intentionally project the hospital in a negative light upon the death of Mr. Aso. After a thorough investigation, the hospital concluded that the physical assault on its members of staff at the Surgical Emergency Unit of the hospital was unwarranted. The Hospital Management deemed it fit to seek redress in the court. Upon receipt of the court order, the Aso family sent a written appeal to the Management of LASUTH for out-ofcourt resolution. In addition, the hospital also received several pleas from well-meaning individuals for leniency on behalf of the family. In order not to further compound the trauma of the family, having lost a loved one, the hospital management agreed to consider the pleadings from the family and well-meaning individuals to withdraw the court case. Consequently, at an out-ofcourt settlement meeting, the family agreed to the following terms with the Hospital – a letter of apology addressed to the Board and Management of LASUTH. Also, individual apology letters addressed to the members of staff who were assaulted; letters should to be signed by Mr. Reinald Uwandu, the Respondent.
