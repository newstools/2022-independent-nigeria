LAGOS  – The Eko Electricity Distribution Company (EKEDC) has felicitated its customers on the Easter celebration whilst assuring them of improved service delivery. Godwin Idemudia, the General Manager, Corporate Communications of the company, in a statement, described Easter as an important period that represents hope, salvation, and new beginnings. He said: ‘We know how essential this holiday is to our customers, hence, we are poised to ensure adequate power supply.’ According to him, the electricity supply in Nigeria is currently impaired due to many challenges especially the system collapse and low allocation from the national grid has suffered three breakdowns within a month, causing outages and irregular power supply across the country. “The company is, however, assuring the customers of working assiduously with the custodian of the transmission network, TCN, to restore normalcy and provide adequate power supply during and after the festive period,” he assured. Idemudia enjoined customers to make use of the available platforms and any of the company’s official social media platforms for their complaints and enquiries, saying this is in line with the strategic plan of the organisation to engage more with its customers vis-a-vis improving its customer service index. “Our technical team is on standby to promptly clear any fault that may emanate within our network,” he assured. He further appealed for more support from the customers in fighting vandalism, which he described as a plague to the company’s network and one of the major reasons for incessant and prolonged outages.
