….. They are Baseless, Watery, Shaky, Says Ozekhome Justice Binta Nyako of the Federal High Court Abuja, on Friday, struck out 8 out of the 15-count charge filed by the Federal Government against the detained leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra, IPOB, Mazi Nnamdi Kanu. Justice Nyako freed Nnamdi Kanu on the 8 counts, namely 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13 and 14, while ruling on a preliminary objection filed by the IPOB leader challenging the validity of the 15-count amended charge preferred against him by the Federal Government. However, the court held that Mazi Kanu has to defend himself on counts 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8 and 15, based on allegations levelled against him. Meanwhile, Kanu’s lead counsel, Mike Ozekhome SAN insisted that the remaining charges are baseless, watery and shaky. Ozekhome said the FG has nothing against his client, hence the repetition of counts in the charge, which he said: “will fall like a pack of cards because you cannot build something on nothing in law”. Also, the court heard Nnamdi Kanu’s bail application and has fixed a ruling on May 18, while trial begins on May 26, at the Code of Conduct Tribunal complex Jabi, Abuja.
