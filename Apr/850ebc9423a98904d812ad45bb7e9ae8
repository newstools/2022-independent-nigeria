Following the emergence of photos of vehicles branded for the 2023 presidential ambition of Central Bank of Nigeria Governor Godwin Emefiele, ex-aide to former President Goodluck Jonathan, Reno Omokri, has said that Emefiele is innocent of the 2023 elections campaign flying around. According to him, there were some other persons behind the move. The socio-political activist, however, said on Saturday, that the campaign vehicles for Emefiele which flooded the social media were only a red herring by a “fifth columnist” and were attempts to taint the CBN governor. Omokri said, “It has come to my knowledge that those vehicles purportedly for the campaign of Emefiele are a red herring by a fifth columnist. The man is innocent and his detractors just want to taint him.” “I will not allow myself to be the instrument of someone else’s mischief!” He added.
