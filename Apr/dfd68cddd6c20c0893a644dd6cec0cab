Barcelona want to land Robert Lewandowski in this summer’s transfer window as they plan for a brighter future under Xavi. And reports claim Bayern Munich are open to parting ways with the Poland international if they get Gavi in return. The 17-year-old has burst onto the scene this term and is regarded as one of world football’s best prospects for the future. Lewandowski has been in astonishing form for Bayern this term, scoring 47 goals across all competitions under Julian Nagelsmann. But with the Bundesliga giants yet to meet his contract demands, it’s possible the 33-year-old will leave the Allianz Arena at the end of the campaign. Lewandowski wants a three-year extension but Bayern, planning economically, only want to extend his existing deal by a year. Amid his issues in Bavaria, talk has been rife Barcelona want to land the veteran at the end of the campaign. And Sport say that, while Bayern aren’t interested in a swap deal involving any of their big names, they are willing to make an exception if they get Gavi in return. Gavi has burst onto the scene this season, shining under Xavi since the Spaniard’s appointment earlier in the campaign. He’s been linked with a move to Liverpool, with Jurgen Klopp appearing to be a big admirer of the teenager. POLL But Barcelona have no interest in letting the midfielder go. Instead, they’re seeking to renew Gavi’s contract and ensure he stays in Catalonia for many years ahead. Another player Bayern have held a past interest in is Sergino Dest, who has blown hot and cold throughout his spell in La Liga.
