LAGOS – The first-ever cue sports league, tagged the Ibadan Snooker League, is scheduled to begin in May 2022. The league will feature 20 good players from 4 centers in the city of Ibadan, namely: Genesis Hotel, Cruzer Lounge, Mauve Lounge, and Bagaville Lounge. The Ibadan Snooker League’s format is to have five players register from each of the four centers, for a total of 20 players. Each player will play another in home and away matches, with the results posted on the league website following each match. According to the organizers, there are hundreds of great pool/snooker players within the state. Players become bored with the game over time due to a lack of competitive events that add value to the game. Our projection in launching the first-ever Cue Sports League (Ibadan Snooker League) in southwest Nigeria, is to change the narrative of the game by adding value to it. The game, over time, in this part of the world, has been perceived as a game for hoodlums, and as such, kills the economic value of the sport. To change that perception, we plan to create a well-organized and professionally recorded league that will not only educate the public about the sport, but will also encourage fans (players) and attract investors. Another wonderful aspect is that it allows young people to stay busy, play their favorite sport in peace, and earn a legitimate living from it. This, we believe, will significantly reduce youth fraud. POLL The three players with the most points on the table win cash and consolation prizes. The league season will last three months, with the goal of having two seasons per year. Beatpluz Konceptz is organizing the event, which is powered by Cruzer Lounge & Bistro and supported by Mauve 21, Genesis Hotel, Bagavill, Bkay farms, Clinton’s Properties Limited. The league is to be fully covered by Kiraa TV as the Sole Media Partner.
