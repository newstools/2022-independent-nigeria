Nigerian broadcaster, Ifedayo Olarinde, popularly known as Daddy Freeze, has warned former Big Brother Naija housemate, Kate Jones aka Ka3na, to stop blaming the devil for failed marriage. The media personality disclosed this in a post on Thursday via his official Instagram page, reacting to Ka3na’s statement on how the devil is seeking to destroy beautiful marriages. However, the broadcaster stated that the devil is not responsible for failed marriages as that is caused by personal errors and shortcomings from the couple. He wrote, “Dear K3na and Nigerian Christians. The devil does not destroy marriages; the devil did not destroy a single marriage in the entire Bible, read for yourself to verify. “So please, let’s stop blaming the devil for our personal errors and shortcomings. -FRZ”
