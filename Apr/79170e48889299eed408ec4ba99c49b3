The Management of Ladoke Akintola University of Technology (LAUTECH), Ogbomoso in Oyo State, has denied the unfounded rumour about a resolution of vote of no confidence allegedly passed on the Ag. Vice-Chancellor of the Institution, Professor Mojeed Olaide Liasu and the Pro-Chancellor and Chairman of its Governing Council, Professor Ayodeji Omole. Registrar of the University and Secretary to the Governing Council, Dr Kayode Ogunleye in a signed Press Release dated April 25, 2022, said it beats the imagination of the management for anybody to insinuate that a University which just concluded a highly successful weeklong Convocation ceremony at the weekend, where all staff cooperated and participated, was going through a crisis. He explained that there was no reason for the Institution to be experiencing any crisis at a period it was determined to do greater exploits adding that Management is resolved to continue to prioritize staff welfare. According to him, “there could not have been any crisis in a University just coming out of a precarious situation where its staff were being owed eight months arrears of salaries, which has just been cleared, where there is now regular payment of salaries even while staff are on strike, where there is now regular promotion of staff, even in the face of dwindling resources. “Council is however not relenting on payments of any other allowances that may be due to staff.
