ASABA – Delta State, Commissioner of Information on Wednesday revealed that Governor Ifeanyi Okowa is yet to pick a nomination form for the Delta North Senatorial or Presidency. Speaking on the outcome of the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) meeting of stakeholders in the state which took place on April 5, 2022, Commissioner of Information, Mr Charles Aniagwu refuted claims that former Governor, Chief James Ibori stormed out of the meeting in anger. He noted that the former Governor took permission to leave the meeting to attend to other important issues. He also revealed that he has no prior knowledge of the decision of the Governor to pick a form in proxy for the Delta North Senatorial seat. He said “The Governor has the right if he chooses to contest any election except the Governorship. He has the legal right to contest for President or to return to the Senate where he left behind remarkable footprints. It is within his rights and there is no law that says you must announce that you have purchased a form. The only thing I know is that Okowa has been consulting knowing that whatever positions he goes into from where he is, will require a large number of persons on the political circle” He confirmed that no fewer than nine Commissioners and the Chief of Staff have resigned to follow their political aspirations and delegate duties respectively in provision with Electoral Act. POLL He further mentioned that Governor Okowa did not sign any pact with Appointees who have resigned, stating that the re-appointment of a person would be based on the prerogative of the Governor.
