In order to promote digital literacy, stem the rate of unemployment and curb social vices such as cybercrime and thuggery among youths, a non-governmental organization (NGO) Reaching Minds Foundation (RMF) has organised another series of its “Tekisite Bootcamp” at Saki, Oyo State. The Tekisite boot camp was held in three secondary schools namely, Sharon Rose College, Christ Grammar School and Faith Model College Saki, between April 4, 2022, and April 8, 2022. The weeklong boot camp as stated by the Founder of the Foundation, Abass Oyeyemi was founded with the specific goal of exposing the students to basic digital literacy skills, and career opportunities in technology, and teaching them core human values. He stated further that the boot camp exposed the students to software development, game development, graphics design, UI/UX designing and digital marketing, stressing that the students were made to pick the category of interests and they were trained in these categories. The Project Manager of Tekisite, Salawu Faizah further explained the details of the project by highlighting that, “Tekisite boot camp, Saki is one way of building on what we do at the foundation. We currently operate a 4 hours per week training in secondary schools in Ife, Osun State where we mobilize our trainers to train the students in digital skills. “However, we’re expanding and we’re touching communities in Oyo, Ogun, Ekiti, Lagos and Ondo states by taking our team there and hosting the students in these rural areas with digital skills”. One of the students, who exercise brilliancy at the boot camp, Busari Umar of Sharon Rose College said, “the training is what I needed now, I’ve always had an ambition of being a computer engineer. This training has exposed me and I’m more interested in learning software development now. With Tekisite, comes honest and decent living”.
