Ramadan is considered one of the holiest months of the year for Muslims. During Ramadan, Muslim families abstain from food and water from sunrise to sunset and gather, either during the morning to start the fast or at night to break it, thus en­couraging a special sharing moment with family, especial­ly at Iftar and Sahur. Continuing this yearly commitment for families during Ramadan season, Co­ca-Cola seeks to encourage bonding moments of real hu­man connection among fami­lies by providing platforms to help them connect and keep them refreshed. To mark this year’s fast­ing, Coca-Cola launched its Ramadan campaign tagged, “This Ramadan, there’s joy when we Iftar together,” to provide Coca-Cola Iftar packages to families to pro­mote togetherness. This is to deepen family bonding over meals while starting the day’s fast and after the break. The online campaign will provide an inside look into the life of individuals and their families during Ramadan in a deeper, more relatable way as it focuses on a chapter by chapter fun cooking moment story of select influencers with their families during the month of Ramadan.
