KANO – A Gubernatorial Aspirant under the platform of All Progressive Congress APC, Engr. Bashir Ishaq Bashir on Saturday announced plans to float an Independent power plant that would generate 100MG to boost the Kano economy. Bashir, a former gubernatorial candidate of the People’s Democratic Movement (PDM), in the 2019 election, who formally joined the 2023 race, said he would restore the economic glory of the state by wooing investors and make Kano a business-friendly state. He lamented that despite the myriad of economic downturns confronting the state, successive governments in the state have shifted their attention to building bridges and flyovers with little or no economic turnover. Mr. Bashir said that “Businesses have collapsed, several companies have closed, and Kano is going backwards with no promising future”. The APC stalwart disclosed that “I will establish a 50MW power plant in my first year in office. Before the tenure runs out, i will increase it to 100MW.” He assured Kano that “We will not be stealing your money. We will restore the image of Kano state as the pride of Arewa and Nigeria. We will revive Kano as a symbol of commerce, business, religion and culture.”
