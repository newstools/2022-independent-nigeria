Lewis Hamilton says that he will be on a host of calls trying to rally up the team and sponsors as Mercedes aim to build on a third and fourth-place finish in Australia. The Silver Arrows have not been at their best this year and some low moments have already passed by with Hamilton finishing 10th in Saudi Arabia. However, he has a podium to his name from the first Grand Prix in Bahrain and George Russell now has one too with him finishing third at the weekend in Albert Park. Certainly, Mercedes have at least got a welcome knack of picking up the pieces when those in front of them do not finish and you would think that, once their car improves performance-wise, they are going to be able to look back on these weeks as crucial building blocks when they’ve been below their best. Ahead of Imola in a couple of weeks, then, Hamilton has said he’s looking to rally the troops: “There’s a lot of work, and there’ll be a lot of calls, naturally. “I’m on a lot of Zoom calls with all the sponsors and our bosses, really trying to rally them up. We’ve got some improvements that we need to make. And we need everyone’s support in doing so, in just making sure we leave no stone unturned. “It’s in making sure the hunger is really there and we’re maximizing absolutely every moment. POLL “I’m chasing the people that are in the wind tunnel, the aero guys, and just looking at absolutely every single area. “There’s performance to be gained in areas that we know. “And we need it now. Not in two or three races. We all know as a team that we have just got to keep that encouragement and keep that energy high.”
