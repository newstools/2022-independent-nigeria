LAGOS – The Progressive Lawyers For Professor Yemi Osinbajo, a group of lawyers canvassing for the emergence of Vice President Yemi Osinbajo as President in 2023 on Wednesday said he will emerge the candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC), irrespective of the mode of primaries adopted by the party. The National Executive Committee (NEC) of the APC on Wednesday said that the presidential candidate of the party will be chosen through an indirect primary election. Speaking with DAILY INDEPENDENT, the leader of the group and human rights activist, Kayode Ajulo, said Osinbajo has the majority of the party members and electorates on his side. He said “Our take is clear. Whether they agree on direct or indirect primaries, it is not cast in stone. That can be changed at any time. What is cast in stone is what the law says. The law of the country as given by the Electoral Act stated that there shall be direct, indirect primaries or consensus. Any other arrangement by the party is not something that we can say cannot be changed. So, to me, I see nothing in what they have done. “Any of the three options they choose, be it direct, indirect or consensus our candidate, Prof. Yemi Osinbajo will win. All these things have been considered before he came out to declare for the presidential election. What matters most is to have the majority of those that will determine the outcome of the election. The party members and the electorate are all with him.”
