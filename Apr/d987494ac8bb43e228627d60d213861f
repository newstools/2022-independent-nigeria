ABUJA – As the country pre­pares for the 2023 general elections, Chairman of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), Prof Mahmood Yakubu, has cautioned the federal and state bureau­crats to guard against ac­tion that may undermine their professional calling as it concerns their deal­ings with elected represen­tatives. Represented by Sam Olumekun, INEC Nation­al Commissioner, at the first quarterly meeting of the forum of the Secretary to the Government of the Federation with Secretar­ies to State Governments, Prof Yakubu advised the bureaucrats to uphold the much reverend tenets of professionalism in their dealings, conscious of their responsibility to co­ordinate the process and activities leading to the implementation of poli­cies of the government. He advised them to shun the lure of politicians who may want to drag the service into politics and damage the bureaucratic setup. The INEC boss further warned that political pa­tronage among civil ser­vants has the potential of destroying the gains that have been made to evolve a credible bureaucracy. According to him, a credible election has a far-reaching positive im­pact on the bureaucracy since, as he noted, a credi­ble candidate in the office is most likely to ensure that credible persons are appointed to office and vice versa. “The fact needs to be stressed that credible elec­tions engender effective bureaucracy. Conversely, when elections are fraught with malpractices, the re­cruitment process of polit­ical office holders is nega­tively impacted. In effect, public office holders may not have what it takes to put in place credible bu­reaucracy to better a lot of the rules. “This is necessary as po­litical office holders may easily lure you into poli­tics thereby politicizing the bureaucratic set-up and destroying the fabrics of the profession. “Political patronage among civil and public ser­vants has the potential to destroy the gains attained over the years,” he said.
