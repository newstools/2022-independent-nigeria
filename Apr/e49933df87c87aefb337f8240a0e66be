Former President Olusegun Obasanjo has mourned the passing of the Alaafin of Oyo, Oba Lamidi Adeyemi. The former president, who described the late Alaafin as a symbol of the nation’s epic struggle in self discovery and self actualisation, said the Oba was a fervent promoter of mutual tolerance. In a letter to the Oyo State Governor, Seyi Makinde, Obasanjo condoled with the family of the late Oba and the entire people of Oyo. Obasanjo said Lamidi stood out as a voice of forthrightness in national affairs, saying “it was during his reign that Oyo town got transformed to the modern city that it has become today.” “Like most great leaders, Alaafin was all things to all people. To his family, he was a tower of strength and a committed provider,” Obasanjo said, stating that the death of Oba Adeyemi “is like a dream, especially as he left us at a crucial state in our nation’s history when his wise counsel and rich experience are greatly needed.” He urged members of his immediate and extended family to take solace in the the fact that the 83-year-old monarch left behind a worthy legacy. “In fact, we ought to give gratitude to God for his worthy life,” Obasanjo added.
