Heaps of refuse indiscriminately littered all parts of the four Local Government Areas of Onitsha North, Onitsha South, Idemili North and Ogbaru are expected to disappear before Monday as Gov.Chukwuma Soludo used Saturday and Sunday business as free days to evacuate the affected Local Government Areas. The directive by the state government is to create a free movement of refuse equipment as they are expected to be deployed by refuse contractors for the purpose of clearing abandoned heaps of refuse in the affected areas. Our correspondent gathered that the declaration of business free days on Saturday and Sunday was to restrict the movement of residents and avoid unnecessary traffic jams as contractors deploy equipment to clear the mess left over by the previous administration.
