Moshood Salvador, a chief­tain of the All Progressives Congress (APC), on Sun­day, cautioned Nigerians against voting for hypo­crites and those with shady characters, who seek their votes, in the forthcoming 2023 general elections. Salvador made the call during the annual Ramadan Lecture/Zakat event, which took place at Salvador Towers in Lagos where thousands of peo­ple benefited from the philan­thropic gesture of the politician. The former Chairman of the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) in Lagos State decried the rising poverty and hardship in the land, saying that politi­cians are not concerned about the wellbeing of the people hence the increasing hardship. He pointed out that Nige­ria was too richly endowed to cater for her citizens, with no­body expected to suffer pover­ty and hardship but lamented that politicians had not bene­fited the masses. As the 2023 election ap­proaches, the APC leader enjoined his followers and the electorate to think twice before voting anybody that seeks their votes.
