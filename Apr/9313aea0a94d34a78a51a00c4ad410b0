AWKA – The Anambra State Chapter of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has said that it suspended Chief Chris Uba, a member of the party‘s Board of Trustees and Chief Nicholas Ukachukwu, a chieftain of the party from the chapter because of anti-party activities. Comrade Okey Asolo, the party’s caretaker Committee Chairman in the State who spoke to Saturday INDEPENDENT at the party’s secretariat in Awka on Friday said both of them participated in the party’s recent primaries in which nine local government areas had been concluded only to turn round and drag the party to Court with a fake list without exhausting the Party’s internal conflict resolution mechanism. The primaries he said were transparently conducted by Governor Seyi Makinde of Oyo State and his team during which nine local government areas had been ratified remaining 12 others which the party’s National Working Committee (NWC) in its wisdom directed should be repeated at a later date. Though he said Chief Uba and Ukachukwu participated in the said primaries only for them to turn around and dragged the party to the court without trying to internally resolve whatever grievances they may have haboured against the primaries thereby going contrary to the constitution of the PDP. “Because of this, we considered their action anti-party deserving of the punishment meted out to them,’’ he said, adding that they had been directed to face a disciplinary committee set up recently. Comrade Asolo, who spoke shortly after supervising the return of nomination forms from aspirants jostling to contest to be the party’s candidates in the May 7 primaries election for both Houses of Assembly and National Assembly positions for the 2023 general elections said the state chapter of the party, was on the same page with the southeast zone of the PDP in its support for a south East presidential candidate in 2023.
