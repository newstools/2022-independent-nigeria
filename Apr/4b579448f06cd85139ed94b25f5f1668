Wilfried Zaha has scored from the penalty spot to give Crystal Palace their third goal in the Monday night English Premiership League (EPL) fixture at Selhurst Park. After going two goals up in the first half courtesy of a 16th-minute header by Jean-Philippe Mateta and 24th-minute Jordan Ayew cool finish, the home side kept their shape for the second half and in the 74th minute, after a swift counter-attack, Martin Odegaard was adjudged to have brought down Zaha and the resultant penalty was slotted home by the former Manchester United player. The Gunners were listless on the night. Misplaced passes, second to the loose balls, little or no cohesion, predictable and very easy for Arsenal hero, Patrick Viera’s men to pick off. Despite all vast improvements to their play in the second half, the game finished Crystal Palace three, Arsenal nil. FULL TIME: Crystal Palace 3 – 0 Arsenal
