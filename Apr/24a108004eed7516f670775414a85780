The Court of Appeal sitting in Abuja in Appeal No. CA/ ABJ/CV/269/2022 in the case between the Asset Manage­ment Corporation of Nigeria (AMCON) vs Jimoh Ibrahim has ruled that all proceedings, including the contempt pro­ceedings initiated by Ibrahim and others at the trial court should be stayed pending the hearing, and determination of the substantive appeal. The application for stay was argued on behalf of AMCON by their defence counsel A.U. Mustapha SAN & Co on March 30, 2022, and after listening to the arguments, the Court of Appeal delivered its ruling on Friday April 22, 2022. With that ruling, Barrister Jimoh Ibra­him and Co have been again neutralized from executing the said contempt proceedings or­der, which he obtained under questionable circumstances. Recall that Jimoh Ibrahim, NICON Investment Limited, NICON Insurance Limited, Nigerian Reinsurance Cor­poration owe the Asset Man­agement Corporation of Ni­geria (AMCON) a whopping N69.4billion with no intention whatsoever to pay. AMCON over the years had tried peace­ful resolution strategies to re­cover the debt from Ibrahim to no avail.
