The Federal Government has vowed to prosecute the husband of late gospel artiste, Osinachi Nwachukwu. According to a statement signed by the Minister of Women Affairs, Pauline Tallen, the late Osinachi would get justice adding that Nigeria can’t continue to lose talented women to mentally unstable men. Recall that that the late singer lost her life after suffering domestic violence from her husband PeterNwachukwu. Reacting to this, Tallen said the government would rehabilitate the children of the deceased, while the husband is made to face the law. Tallen said: “As with every news of domestic violence which spreads like wildfire, I was woken up to the news of the untimely death of one of Nigeria’s finest female gospel artists Osinachi who was said to have died as a result of cancer on 8th April 2022. This could have passed as one of those news, until new facts started emerging that she died as a result of domestic violence. “The Federal Government of Nigeria and the states have declared zero tolerance for Gender-Based Violence. And so, the Federal Ministry of Women Affairs under my watch will prosecute this matter to get justice for Osinachi. “We cannot continue to keep losing our young women to mentally unstable young men all in the name of marriage. Life first before anything.” Osinachi’s death has brought to the fore the issue of domestic violence in the country, with women most times at the receiving end.
