The Ijaiye/Agbado Community in Lagos State met recently to assess the security issue of the area. The landlords and residents gave a pass mark to the Ijaiye/Agbado Road Police Station on their 24-hour surveillance in order to curtail the menace of criminals. The meeting was held near Jankara Motor Spare Parts Dealers where there they lauded the Divisional Police Officer, CSP Gbenga Ogunsakin, and his men for a job well done, adding that their effort was yielding a positive result. Alhaji Tijani Olaosebikan who was speaking on behalf of other members, said some members would soon meet the DPO to discuss other black spots in the area. He said Ijaiye Agbado had been relatively peaceful now, as the area boys, miscreants and hooligans have found new jobs to do.
