Arsenal lead the race for signing 26-year-old Spain winger Marco Asensio from Real Madrid. AC Milan appeared to be in the driving seat for his signature, but the Serie A club rejected his wage demands. The Spaniard’s contract expires at the end of June this season, and Arsenal seem to remain the favourites to grab his signature. Marco Asensio has appeared 243 times, having scored 40 goals across all competitions so far. The Spanish international has an average of 27.2 passes per game with a passing success rate of 86.8%. Even this term, he has managed to put up some impressive numbers on the board – averaging 1.7 shots, 0.7 key passes, 0.7 dribbles, 0.4 crosses, and 0.9 long balls per 90 minutes in the Spanish top-flight (calculated across 38 appearances), grabbing 11 goals and 1 assist on all fronts. He seems to have recaptured his form prior to his ACL injury which had ruled him out for the 2019/20 season. Capable of playing in the central midfield and on the right-wing, he could proficiently add to the Gunners’ attack although he remains weak in dropping back on defence which he’ll need to work upon (stats via Whoscored)
