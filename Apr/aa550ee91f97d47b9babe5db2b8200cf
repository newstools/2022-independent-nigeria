LAGOS – The Vanguard for Good Governance and Integrity, a political pressure group, has called on the people of Okura state constituency in Dekina local government in Kogi State, to support the aspiration of Comrade Joseph Egene to represent the constituency in the state’s House of Assembly. Speaking with Sunday INDEPENDENT in Lagos, the group’s National President, Chief Abubakar Anemona, described the aspirant as well-grounded and would give the people of Okura a new lease of life in terms of infrastructure development. Anemona stressed that as the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) primaries would be taking place soon, the delegates should ensure that Comrade Egene would be given the party’s ticket as he would give the people a good representation if elected into the state’s House of Assembly. He noted that the people of Okura had been lagging behind in the area of infrastructure due to poor representations they had been subjected to over the years, but if Egene was elected into the House, there would be a turnaround in the area. Anemona maintained that having consulted widely with stakeholders, the Vanguard for Good Governance and Integrity believed that if elected, Comrade Egene would liaise with his colleagues in the House and the Executive to attract dividends of democracy in form of constituency projects like pipe-borne water and good roads and youth empowerment to Okura. Amenona said: “As a young man, Comrade Egene will help to tackle the problem of youth unemployment in the area. He has promised to help empower the youths to make them viable. He has also promised to attract infrastructure to the place so that the people will be like their counterparts in the state. “Let the people of Okura give Comrade Joseph Egene a chance. The delegates should ensure that they vote for him for the progress of the area. The PDP ticket for Egene is a key to new life and better living for the people of Okura in the coming dispensation,” Anemona stressed.
