The Sango/Ota Police Area Command in Ogun State has been given a pat on the back over the arrest of thieves, criminals and miscreants in the area. The recent arrest of a thief with gun in Joju area a couple of weeks ago has also given a boost to the police officers of the station. Speaking to Daily Independent, some residents commended the new Divisional Police Officer (DPO), SP Saleh Dahiru, and his men for a job well done. Mr. Wahab Olubi, a landlord and other residents said the suspect was arrested after the residents had informed the police officers. “In a swift reaction, the Joju area was combed by the police before the suspect was later arrested and taken to the station for questioning,” they said. Meanwhile, Sango residents have been reminded to always cooperate with police officers so that the various crimes being perpetrated by hoodlums and area boys would be drastically reduced.
