A Russian missile strike on a Ukrainian train station killed at least 50 civilians and wounded another 98 Friday. At least five of the dead and at least 16 of the injured were children, the leader of the Donetsk regional administration, Pavlo Kyrylenko, confirmed in a tweet. The Kramatorsk railway station in eastern Ukraine was flooded with nearly 4,000 people, many of them elderly, women, and children, trying to escape to less war torn parts of the country at the time of the attack. Russia has been conducting a bloody invasion of Ukraine for nearly two months, inflicting a high civilian and military death toll and widespread destruction. Russia has refused to claim responsibility for the carnage, according to state-owned RIA news agency, Forbes reported.
