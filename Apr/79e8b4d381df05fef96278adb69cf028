Vice President Yemi Osinbajo, on Monday, said it would be an injustice if he did not contest the 2023 election with his vast experience in the last seven years in office. Osinbajo said this when he visited Gov. Oluwarotimi Akeredolu Ondo State in his office in Akure. The vice president hailed President Muhammadu Buhari’s open-mindedness in delegating to him serious tasks that had aided his experience. He said that it was God that put people in power, but noted that it would be a betrayal of his country for him to retire with all his exposure in government. He commended Akeredolu for the giant strides of achievements in the state. “It is such a special privilege to be called to serve, it is a very special privilege to serve either as ecxo, house of assembly, even as NWC member. “I am sure that everybody knows that I have formally declared my intention to run as president of the Federal Republic of Nigeria. “I did so on Monday, April 11th, 2022 and I did so because, first of all there is nobody that can bear anything God does not decide that he would be, only God can make a person president, vice president, governor, anything whatsoever.
