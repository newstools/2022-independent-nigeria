Arsenal are closing on a stunning swoop for former Chelsea star Edin Hazard, according to reports. Hazard, 31, was one one of the most feared strikers in the Premier League during his time with the Blues. Signing for Real Madrid in the summer of 2019 for £89million, his career has nose-dived and the Belgian star has been a shadow of the player he was at Stamford Bridge. Arsenal are keen to help him resurrect his form by offering him an escape route and the chance for him to move back to the Premier League. News outlet Foot Mercato are claiming talks have taken place between his representatives and the north London side last week. Mikel Arteta is keen on a deal to bring Hazard to the Emirates, with club looking to initially complete a loan deal for the player with the option to buy. Since his arrival in the Spanish capital, the Belgium international has been blighted by injuries and fitness issues. He has netted just once in 23 appearances this season for Los Blancos and continues to be overlook by manager Carlo Ancelotti when fit. POLL Hazard recently underwent leg surgery which ruled him out of Wednesday’s Champions League victory over his former side Chelsea. Fans have made it clear they are unhappy with the player and vented their anger when Chelsea defeated Madrid in last seasons Champions League semi-final. Hazard was spotted joking with former team-mate Kurt Zouma after a 2-0 defeat at Stamford Bridge which put eventual tournament winners Chelsea through 3-1 on aggregate. ‘I am sorry. I have read lots of opinions about me and it was not my intention to offend Real fans’, Hazard said after a backlash. ‘It has always been my dream to play for Real Madrid and I came here to win’.
