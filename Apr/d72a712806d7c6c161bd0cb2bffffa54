The Oluwo of Iwo, Oba Abdulrosheed Adewale Akanbi, has urged Nigerians not to vote in a South-eastern person as their 2023 president, giving reasons for not trusting the South Easterners for the position. The monarch in a statement through Alli Ibraheem, his Chief Press Secretary, stated that the civil war wounds meted on south easterners is a weak factor to institutionalize policies capable of destroying Nigeria. He said, “The civil war wounds meted on south easterners is a weak factor to institutionalize policies capable of tearing the nation apart. “I have people from across Nigeria in Iwo, including the South Easterners. They do not only have their businesses but also built their houses and own farm lands. Such is not only peculiar to Iwo but to other parts of the country, except the South-East. A Nigerian in Nigeria should be able to own land anywhere. “The style by the South easterners is barbaric. Such is not only detrimental to their economic viability but also to their political recognition. As a traditional ruler, I can’t trust any South easterner as my President. “You can’t be a leader on sectional interest. With such unsophisticated, primitive and uncivilized thinking, no Nigerian from other zones will vote a south easterner as their President.”
