The Rector, Federal Polytechnic, Ado-Ekiti, Dr Hephzibah Oladebeye, has underscored the importance of a comprehensive database and robust networking as crucial to the success of Alumni Associations. Dr Oladebeye, who was the keynote speaker at the second edition of the Business Meeting of the Federal University of Technology, Akure(FUTA) Alumni Association, Ekiti State chapter, tagged: “The Conclave 2.0” said the chapter had taken the lead on how to give back to its alma mater, particularly with the introduction of a far-reaching scholarship scheme. In his address of welcome, the Ekiti State Chairman, FUTA Alumni, Comrade Samuel Omoniyi-Ojo thanked members for their support and commitment to the growth and development of their alma mater. Ojo said the annual event had provided the opportunity for the younger members to interact with the older ones. He, therefore, charged members on timely payment of their annual dues and Development Trust Fund. Also speaking, a former member of the House of Representatives, Hon Bamidele Faparusi, who chaired the Alumni Scholarship Fundraising made an annual personally commitment of N250,000 to the Scholarship Initiative. Other members also donated generously to the Scheme which is expected to take off this year.
