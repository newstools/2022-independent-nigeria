Chelsea are set to battle it out with Manchester United for Villarreal centre-back Pau Torres. Sport Witness has claimed that Torres, who has a release clause of £56.5 million, is expected to garner interest once again this summer and could finally be enticed to join a Premier League club. Torres has been a long-term target of Manchester United, and is currently in the midst of his best season so far – helping lead the Yellow Submarine to the Champions League semi-final.
