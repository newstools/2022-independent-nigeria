ABUJA  – Dr. Ogbonnaya Onu, Minister of Sci­ence, Technology and Innovation, has explained that the Pres­idential Executive Order No.5 is designed to promote Nigerian content in contract awards, science, engineering and technology for Nigerians both at home and in the Di­aspora. Onu stated this on Thurs­day in Abuja at the sensitisa­tion workshop for staff of the Federal Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation, as well as the launch of the Complaints/Appeal Proce­dure of the Presidential Ex­ecutive Order No. 5. Recall that President Muhammadu Buhari had signed the Presidential Ex­ecutive Order No.5 in Febru­ary, 2018. Onu noted that the Execu­tive Order is a revolutionary document aimed at man­dating procuring entities to give preference to Nigerian companies and firms in the award of contracts in line with the Public Procure­ment Act of 2007, as well as the engagement of Nigerian professionals in areas where their requisite expertise are available, among others. He revealed that the im­plementation of the Execu­tive Order No.5 has begun to yield fruits. He said: “I am also happy that already, the effect of the Executive Order is being felt in the country. “The University of Trans­portation, Daura, is one of the products of the Executive Order. Also as a result of the Executive Order, it became necessary to organise both the first and second Strategy Competitiveness Workshop for various regulatory bodies in the country. “This helped to strengthen the operations of the Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) for the good of the country.” POLL On the launch of the Com­plaints/Appeal Procedure, he said it would address various complaints in all the sectors of the economy. While commending Pres­ident Buhari for his support and encouragement, Onu also showered encomiums on the National Coordinator of the Strategy Implementation Task Office of the Presiden­tial Executive Order No. 5 and his team for their immense achievements.
