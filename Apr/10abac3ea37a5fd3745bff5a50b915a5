Men who do things without being told draw the most wages and the real freedom of any individual can always be measured by the amount of responsibility, that he must assume for his people’s welfare and security. But for the former Nigerian Ambassador to Ghana with a ministerial appointment in tow; has remained unapologetically undaunted by the many adversities that have trailed him in the recent past since he left his plum post as the minister of state for defense. It is, however, already a foregone conclusion in the Lagos political space that, popular Lagos politician, Senator Musiliu Obanikoro has thrown his hat into the ring for the Lagos West Senatorial District seat in the coming 2023 general elections. The former Lagos Island LG boss, commissioner, senator, ambassador and minister, says he is earnestly in the race to ostensibly honour and preserve the dignity of the founding fathers of Lagos State, and to calm the nerves of the natives. Koro, as he is often called by admirers and fellow politicians is not new to the political terrain of Lagos State, and even at the national level, as he has been there, at virtually all levels of political offices, elective or appointive. Eclectic Senator Obanikoro is like a cat with nine lives, who have been confronted with much travail as a politician and overcame them all; perhaps because of his sagacity and niche for political dexterity at any opportune instance.
