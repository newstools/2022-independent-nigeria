LAGOS  – The Pan Niger Delta Forum (PANDEF) has berated Governor Samuel Ortom’s led Peoples Democratic Party  (PDP) presidential zoning committee for throwing the ticket open, stressing that it is an awful decision and there will be consequences. The Niger Delta socio-cultural organization in a press statement on Wednesday signed by Hon. Ken Robinson, its National Publicity Secretary stated that it was not utterly surprised at the development, pointing out that the outcome was predictable because there were evident pointers that this would be the conclusion. The statement reads, “Governor Ortom’s Committee had a script and they have played it out, with due deference to some patriots that were in the Committee. “The level of desperation and political debauchery being demonstrated by some political stakeholders is deplorable and quite disappointing. “Regrettably, we are in a society where it seems anything goes. We will await the conduct of the presidential primaries by the parties to assess the choices that would be presented to us,” the statement further reads. Meanwhile, PANDEF insists that for fairness, equity, justice and in the nation’s interest, the next President of Nigeria, to succeed President Muhammadu Buhari in 2023, should come from the South. “Anything otherwise would be detrimental to national peace and cohesion. The basis of any viable democracy, especially in a diverse and complex country such as Nigeria, is fairness and even sharing of power,” PANDEF  stated. The organisation reiterates the call by the Southern and Middle Belt Leaders’ Forum (SMBLF) on the people and all lovers of peace and equity in Nigeria to reject any political party that fails to zone its presidential ticket to the South.
