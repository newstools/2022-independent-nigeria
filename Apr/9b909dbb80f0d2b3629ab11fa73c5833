Manchester United midfielder Paul Pogba is closing in on a move to Paris Saint-Germain, according to reports in France. Pogba’s current deal with United expires at the end of the season, which allows him to leave Old Trafford as a free agent. The World Cup winner has not reached a new agreement with United, while he admits he is keen to join a club who are more capable of winning trophies. ‘You have to be honest, the last five seasons have not satisfied me – really not at all,’ Pogba said last month. ‘This year it is dead, we won’t win anything. Whether it is with Manchester United or at another club, I want to win trophies.’ The report claims that Pogba indicated that he and his family would be happy to move to Paris. Juventus were also linked with a move for Pogba but FootMercato report that the Serie A club are not interested in a move. Similarly, United have given up hope of reaching an agreement with Pogba after the midfielder turned down their offer of a deal worth £400,000 a week. POLL Speaking last week, former United captain Wayne Rooney admitted he felt it was best for both club and player if Pogba were to leave Old Trafford at the end of the season. ‘I think it’s probably got to a point where it probably is better for him to move on,’ Rooney said. ‘I think if Paul is honest with himself, he probably hasn’t had the impact he would have liked since he returned to Manchester United. ‘I watch him play for France and it’s a completely different player. The ability, his vision, control of the game is there every game for France. It just hasn’t quite worked at Manchester United for him. ‘I think there are a few players they need to let go.’
