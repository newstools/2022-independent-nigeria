In a year that his digital Bank, DafriBank Digital LTD, took off to a flying start, Xolane Ndhlovu’s name appearing on the November 2021 list of the Top 50 Richest People in Crypto is considered by many as the icing on the cake and a deserved recognition for an enigmatic figure that has become the icon of enterprise for the young generation of Africans. The Top 50 Crypto Rich List, released in November 2021, ranked Xolane Ndhlovu 40th ahead of the likes of Roberto Dagnoni (41) the executive chairman and CEO of 2TM, the parent company of Mercado Bitcoin, Latin America’s first crypto unicorn that raised $200 million from Japan’s SoftBank, Peter Smith (49), co-founder and CEO of Blockchain.com, one of the most popular online crypto wallets in the world with millions of users around the globe, and Kris Marszalek (48) who in 2016 founded Monaco, a cryptocurrency payments company that was rebranded to Crypto.com in 2018 and tailored towards the provision of crypto debit cards, and centralized and decentralized exchange services. Xolane Ndhlovu, entrepreneur extraordinaire, omnivore investor and incurable philanthropist, was the only African on the November list of The 50 Richest People in Crypto 2021. While a traditional businessman, Ndhlovu’s investment in tech companies increased his fortune to R6 billion as of 2021, with most of his fortune traceable to his holdings in Binance (BNB) and investments in tech-focused startups which include DafriBank, Bolt and Polkadot. His reputation as a cerebral business mind has waxed stronger with the way he has transformed his UMEH enterprise into a $100m business company which subsequently merged with DafriGroup, that in a few years grew into a phenomenal conglomerate that operates across four African countries and the UK with no less than 18 subsidiaries.
