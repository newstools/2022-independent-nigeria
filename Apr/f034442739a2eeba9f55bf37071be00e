President Muhammadu Buhari has stated that Boko Haram insurgents are not true Muslims because God does not believe in killing innocent people in Islam. Buhari disclosed this on Wednesday at a meeting with the Chief Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court (ICC), Karin Ahmad Khan, at State House in Abuja. The President said, “God is justice. You can’t kill innocent people, and shout; Allah Akbar (God is great). It’s either you don’t know that God at all, or you are simply being stupid. “To say Western education is unacceptable (Haram) is very fraudulent. That is why we are fighting them, and educating the people. And we are succeeding a lot. “Education is fundamental. Religion and ethnicity are out of it. Some people have just made it a lifestyle to cause confusion, destruction and death.”
