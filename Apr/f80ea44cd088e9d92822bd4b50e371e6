Barcelona will look to end their recent Camp Nou hoodoo as they entertain Mallorca on Sunday in La Liga action. Xavi’s side suffered a third home defeat in a row last time out with a disappointing 1-0 defeat to Rayo Vallecano. However, Barça still remain in the driving seat for second place and Champions League qualification next season and Xavi will be keen to remind his players about their progress in recent months. Here’s how the Catalan side could line up. Marc-Andre ter Stegen (GK) – Hasn’t quite hit the heights this season as he has in previous campaigns, but he remains a dependable goalkeeper. Dani Alves (RB) – Likely to return to the starting lineup after missing out through injury last weekend. Ronald Araujo (CB) – Penned a new deal at Camp Nou this week, which will keep him in Barcelona until 2026. Gerard Pique (CB) – Forced to sit out of last weekend’s defeat at Camp Nou, for reasons involving football or otherwise. POLL Jordi Alba (LB) – The energy he provides on the left hand side at 33 years old is remarkable. Sergio Busquets (CM) – He can often look his age in games which become stretched but, when Barcelona are flowing with a purpose, the Spaniard is usually at the heart of it. Gavi (CM) – Denied a blatant penalty in the defeat to Rayo Vallecano last weekend. Frenkie de Jong (CM) – Constantly linked with a move away from Barcelona, but Xavi seems to adore his qualities. Ousmane Dembele (RW) – Barcelona’s danger man in terms of chance creation, but his final ball veers from the brilliant to the baffling. Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang (ST) – Has scored 11 goals in his last 15 games for Barcelona, as many as in his previous 34 games in all competitions. Memphis Depay (LW) – Could replace Ferran Torres on the left hand side, who has struggled in recent weeks.
