ABUJA: Women from the South-South region of the country under the auspices of the South-South Women Political Front (SSWPF) have described the recent threat to issue a warrant of arrest against the Minister of Niger Delta Affairs, Senator Godswill Akpabio as a ploy to make him mislead the Federal Government into accepting to “pay for inflated, bogus and fictitious projects in the past.” In a statement in Asaba, Delta State, SSWPF spokesperson, Doris Ogba, described Akpabio “as a transformational figure, towering statesman and a visionary hero.” The statement also condemned the threat as “a measure designed to retard the progress of the region, strip the Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC) of the transparency qualities it had developed in the last two years and return it to its most corrupt days’’. While commending stakeholders in the area for joining hands with the Minister to uplift it, they said that ‘’Senator Godswill Akpabio is a thoughtful, decent and progressive fellow. His humility is boundless’’. This is as they pointed out that the projects and programmes heinitiated “directly benefited the people in various areas such as security, health, education, roads, housing, electrification, transportation, agriculture and tourism.” According to them, the Minister also redirected the region on to the path of development. The statement further emphasized Akpabio’s politics of performance, virtue in waiting, deep appetite for change, rapid infrastructure development and peace in the Niger Delta region. The SSWPF lambasted ‘’The Wailing Women of the Niger Delta, The Integrity Friends for Truth and Peace Initiative (TIFPI)” and others, describing them as spoilers.
