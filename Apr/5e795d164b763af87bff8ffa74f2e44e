Nigerians have been charged to vote out political officeholders who failed to perform very well while in office in the next general elections. Oluwafemi Ayejusunle, a chieftain of All Progressives Congress (APC) contesting to represent Okitipupa Constituency II at the state House of Assembly, made the call on Friday in Akure while speaking with newsmen on the performance of public officeholders. He noted that many representatives and political officeholders usually abandoned their constituents only to come back when it’s time for another election. Ayejusunle, who said he had at different instances facilitated job opportunities for some youths from the local government, advised the people to ensure politicians with a nonchalant attitude should be voted out of office. He said some politicians had the erroneous belief that they could buy the people’s conscience by giving them money at the polling units in exchange for their votes, thereby abandoning the people after getting their mandate. Ayejusunle promised to change the narratives by giving the people quality representation at the Assembly if chosen as his party’s candidate and given the mandate by the people at the polls. He said he would facilitate developmental projects through budgetary allocation at the Assembly. The APC chieftain, from his political foundation, has always been a progressive right from Alliance for Democracy (AD) to APC when it was formed.
