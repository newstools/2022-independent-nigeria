Paulo Dybala sparked transfer speculation after exchanging shirts with Barcelona player – and his former Juventus teammate – Dani Alves. The pair met up in Barcelona today and showed off the encounter via their Instagram accounts. After exchanging messages to their ‘brother’, the players swapped shirts, with Dybala taking the Dani Alves Barcelona jersey and the Brazilian receiving the latest Juventus kit. Dybala will be a free agent when his contract with Juve expires on June 30, as the club did not offer him a new deal. Several clubs are interested in picking up the Argentina international, including Barcelona, so this meeting and pose with the jersey only further fuelled speculation. The Instagram post was full of Barca supporters calling for La Joya to join them next season. Inter, Real Madrid, Tottenham Hotspur, Manchester United and Paris Saint-Germain have also been linked with a Dybala swoop. Dani Alves was at Juve in the 2016-17 season, when he was teammates with Dybala. POLL
