In a recent report, Calciomercato stated that Manchester United are showing serious interest in Lazio talent Sergej Milinković-Savić. It is understood that the Red Devils could face competition in the form of Bayern Munich, Real Madrid and Paris Saint-Germain in pursuit of the Serbian midfielder. The Serbian midfield ace is having a good season in Italian football after putting in a series of eye-catching displays at the heart of Lazio’s midfield. Milinković-Savić has found the back of the net on nine occasions and secured ten assists in 41 matches for the Italian outfit during this campaign across all competitions. The 27-year-old deserves a lot of credit for performing at a high level as he is averaging 1.9 tackles, 0.9 interceptions, 1.2 clearances, 1.9 shots, 1.3 key passes and 1.2 dribbles per game in Serie A. Milinkovic-Savic can do a little bit of everything at the centre of the park. He is a solid tackler of the ball and can time his challenges well to earn the ball back in midfield. The Spain-born sensation doesn’t mind clearing the danger when needed and can shoot the ball with power and accuracy from long range. He can create some decent chances for others around him and make some energetic runs with the ball from midfield. At 27, Milinkovic-Savic is currently playing in his prime. Hence, he will be a good option for the Red Devils to consider during the summer transfer period. He will be an upgrade over Fred and Scott McTominay and could go on to become a real fan-favourite at Old Trafford in the coming seasons. Plus, a player of the Serbian’s skillet will enhance the quality of Man United‘s first XI and could help the Red Devils challenge for some major trophies in the future. Thus, the Mancunian giants should think about trying everything they can to lure him to the Theatre of Dreams when the transfer window reopens in the summer.
