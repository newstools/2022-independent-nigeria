A chieftain of the Social Democratic Party (SDP), Chief Segun Oni, has tasked Ekiti State Governor Kayode Fayemi to do more in securing the lives and properties of the Ekiti people who are frequently being attacked by bandits and kidnappers. Oni, who is the Governorship candidate of the SDP for the June 18 Governorship Poll called on Governor Fayemi to bring his knowledge and experience in War Studies to bear in tackling the menace. The former governor who spoke in Oye, Ikole, Ekiti East and Gbonyi Local Government Areas of the state in continuation of his familiarisation tour said the issue has become a serious war against the state and the nation, which must be tackled with all seriousness. “I am calling on Governor Kayode Fayemi, PhD War Studies, to use his knowledge to tackle kidnapping in the state. Kidnappers have declared war on our people. This has been going on since about four years ago and it has not ceased. As an engineer, I will fix any engineering facing the state. “He should not only chase them away but arrest them and bring them to book. This he should do before October 16, 2022 when he will be leaving office to justify the mandate the people gave him four years ago.”
