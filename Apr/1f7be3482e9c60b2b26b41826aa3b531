The People’s Democratic Party (PDP) presidential aspirant and Governor of Rivers State, Nyesom Wike on Wednesday revealed the only reason he can step down from contesting for the 2023 general election. Wike, who made this revelation while speaking during a courtesy visit to the Governor of Kano State, Abdullahi Ganduje said that he would have stepped down and not run for the Presidency if Ganduje was contesting for the same position come 2023. He said, “If Ganduje is running for the presidency some of us will quickly withdraw our ambitions, but thank God he is not running, and I’m sure he will help me to make it.” He, however, urged the Kano State Governor to support his 2023 Presidential ambition. Daily Independent reports that Ganduje had earlier warned Wike against pursuing his Presidential ambition predicting that Wike would lose if he runs for the Presidency in 2023.
