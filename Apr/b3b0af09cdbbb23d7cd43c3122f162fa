Abuja – Justice Taiwo Taiwo of the Federal High Court sitting in Abuja has restrained the Edo State government from conducting its local government council elections scheduled for April 19. Justice Taiwo made the order on Tuesday in a ruling on a motion ex parte filed by the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) challenging the conduct of the poll. The applicant (PDP) contended that the passage of the Edo State Electoral Amendment Law which provides 15 days within which political parties can conduct primary elections, send the names of candidates to INEC and campaign before the elections is at variance with the Electoral Amendment Act 2022 signed into law by President Muhammadu Buhari. The trial Judge agreed with the plaintiff/applicant that the review of the Electoral Amendment Act by Edo State House of Assembly is in contrast with the provision of the Electoral Act as amended by the National Assembly. In view of this reason, the court, therefore, restrained Edo State from going ahead to conduct the local government elections. Also, the court ordered all Edo State agencies and INEC from giving effect to the amended law 2022, pending the determination of the suit. The court has fixed April 14 for hearing of the substantive suit.
