The Bayelsa State Governor, Douye Diri, has charged Christians and citizens of the country to rededicate themselves to the lessons of Easter as exemplified by the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ. In his Easter message issued on Saturday, Governor Diri noted that this should manifest in peaceful co-existence and demonstration of love among the people to preserve unity in the society. According to him, the season of Easter had afforded yet another opportunity for Christians and indeed people all over the world to reflect on the purpose of Christ’s sacrificial death. The governor added that the resurrection and defeat of death by the Lord and Saviour had rekindled hope for everyone that believed in Him. He noted that Nigeria was going through tough times at present and Easter was not a period of despair but a season to renew hope for a better future for the country. Diri said, “As we reflect on the essence of this significant season, I urge all Christians, Nigerians, and, indeed, the people of Bayelsa State to rededicate themselves to the lessons of our Saviour’s death and resurrection. This should manifest in love towards fellow man, peaceful cohabitation and ensuring our unity as a people is preserved. “Our country is going through challenging times at the moment. Easter is, therefore, a time not to despair but a season to renew hope of a better future for Nigeria and Bayelsa in particular. “This is the faith of our Prosperity Administration. We are, therefore, focused on our developmental agenda for our state. POLL “In times of great distress as now, what is required is an unyielding faith and the stoic courage to confront and surmount challenges. With our faith anchored on Christ, we remain resolute in our pursuit to change the developmental narrative of our state.”
