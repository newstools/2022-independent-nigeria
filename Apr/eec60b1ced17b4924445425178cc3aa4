Former Anambra State Governor, Peter Obi’s presidential aspiration appears to have drawn the largest voluntary support and campaign network, second to none in the history of the 22 years democratic practice in the country. This was disclosed by Marcel Ngogbehai, director of Strategy and Mobilisation, Peter Obi Support Network, POSN while speaking with journalists recently on its plan to embark on N6 Billion fundraising to help the campaign strive. The former governor declared intention to run for presidency which not only sparked activities on social media like Facebook and Twitter, it also, for the first time opened up the choice of crown funding for a presidential candidate. Recall that Seun Onigbinde, co-founder, BudgIT, highly reputable budget tracking and public sector spending watchdog vowed to initiate a N10 billion crowd funding initiative to back Obi. POSN, made up of Nigerians and Nigerians in diaspora, have come together to contribute both personal efforts and to contribute financial resources to help finance the expenses of Mr Obi’s presidential campaign. Ngogbehai says that its for findings on how expansive Obi’s Support base is came from online and field research on how best to support Peter Obi. “We did not want to duplicate effort or repeat what others have done so far and failed. “What we want to do is seek new ways of helping out and our findings were shorking. POLL “The datas and figures we got were not just that. We could pick bodies to each of those campaign groups across the country and in Diaspora,” Ngogbehai said. The group say that he is the most suited to lead Nigeria at this time, according to Marcel Ngogbehai, director, Strategy and Mobilisation.
