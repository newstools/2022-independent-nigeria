A socio-political group in the Akwa Ibom state chapter of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Defenders of Akwa Ibom APC (DAIA), has cautioned the new leadership of the APC against making the same mistakes that led to the loss of Zamfara and Rivers States during the 2019 General Elections. Speaking against the background of the party’s decision to recognize and inaugurate Obong Stephen Ntukekpo as the chairman of the Akwa Ibom State chapter when the issues of the congresses that led to his emergence were still under judicial review, the group in a statement by its Coordinator, Ibok Essien, warned the APC NWC not to make the same mistake it made in Zamfara and Rivers again. He said: “What happened in Zamfara and Rivers States are still very fresh in our memory and it would be catastrophic for us as a party if we did not learn any lesson from the issues.” Noting that the same issues of upholding the constitution of the party and of the Electoral Act were now at play in Akwa Ibom, the group called for caution. “The fact is that a significant proportion of the party membership including at the grassroots and leaders have issues with the emergence of Obong Stephen Ntukekpo as chairman of the party. “These members have in adherence to the rule of law taken up their case in the courts and it is a shock that even before their right to fair hearing is adjudicated that their rights have been abridged. “Our warning is that the party must take heed so that the disaster of Zamfara and Rivers do not befall us in Akwa Ibom.” Noting that the caution had become more important in the wake of the increased mobilization of the grassroots for 2023 victory, the group continued: “Our grassroots in Akwa Ibom have more than ever been energized for victory in the forthcoming 2023 General Election. What they are asking is for things to be done properly for them to deliver Akwa Ibom from the yoke of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP.”
