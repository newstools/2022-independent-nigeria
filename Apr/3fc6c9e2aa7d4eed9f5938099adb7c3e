Borussia Dortmund midfielder Giovanni Reyna has been ruled out for the rest of the season after sustaining a muscle and tendon injury, the Bundesliga club said on Sunday. The American international played only two minutes against Stuttgart in the league on Friday before being substituted as Dortmund went on to win 2-0 thanks to a double from his replacement Julian Brandt. Dortmund centre back Mats Hummels will also miss ‘several weeks’ after sustaining a muscle injury in the same match. Reyna, 19, has endured an injury-hit campaign for the Ruhr valley club, having featured in only 13 games across all competitions. If his injury problems continue, however, it would be a huge blow for the talented star and his national team. He was able to help his side secure qualification for the World Cup in Qatar, which will take place in seven months time. Following Reyna’s latest setback, Dortmund manager Marco Rose spoke to Sky Sport Germany after the win over Stuttgart. ‘It’s a drama, you really have to say that,’ he said. POLL ‘A really, really great footballer, fine person. If he stays healthy he will be world class. I’m not leaning too far out of the window. We will support him in everything.’ Second-placed Dortmund host Wolfsburg in the Bundesliga on Saturday before a trip to leaders Bayern Munich, who they trail by nine points.
