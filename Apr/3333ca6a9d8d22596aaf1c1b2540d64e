ABUJA – Following recent reports of insecurity in parts of the Fed­eral Capital Territory (FCT) Area Council, the Minister of State, Dr. Ramatu Tijjani Aliyu, has urged traditional rulers and other stakehold­ers to devise new methods of combating insecurity in the nation’s capital. Aliyu gave the charge during the 6th security meet­ing with area council chair­men, graded chiefs, and other critical stakeholders in the territory. Aliyu stated that the direc­tive had become necessary due to pockets of reported kidnapping cases and the upcoming Ramadan festi­val, emphasising the need to re-strategise and strengthen areas of need. She, however, blamed re­cent bandit’s attacks in some communities of Abaji Area Council on failure of intelli­gence gathering, while add­ing that security agencies should not wait until attacks were launched on innocent residents before embarking on a mission. She said, “In view of re­cent reports from area coun­cils like Gwagwalada, Kwali and Bwari, there is every reason for us to come back, re-strategize and ask what is happening, where are we failing, and where we need to strengthen. We need to do an analysis of where our strength lies and where we need to fortify.
