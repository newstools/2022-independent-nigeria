Head Coach of Remo Stars, Gbenga Ogunbote, has berated the state of playing turf at the Dan Anyiam Stadium. Ogunbote was displeased with the state of affairs at the turf saying it deprived football followers the best of it. Following a stalemate with Heartland, he feels that the Owerri based side can upturn things if they acquire a better playing turf. He said: “It’s a difficult one to really access. I’m not surprised the team is in that position. They need to look for a better pitch. It’s really affecting them. “This kind of a pitch ought not to be played. It didn’t let us see the beauty of the game. It’s not good, a lot of bumps and the rest. You can’t make three or four passes successfully. “You can see Rangers today, their fortune changed bacause they left a bad pitch for a better one. If they do so, things will change for them.”
