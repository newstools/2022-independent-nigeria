Members of Michigan’s Muslim community are exercising vigilance and, in some cases, calling for ramped-up security around their places of worship, following a serious security threat by a man who came from out of state to commit acts of violence against Detroit-area mosques. A 60-year-old man from Minnesota was held in the Van Buren County Jail in western Michigan, as he awaited charges for reportedly ramming 11 vehicles in Paw Paw earlier this week, according to local news reports. Victims said they believe the man intentionally hit “vehicles driven by persons of colour”. The suspect was caught largely because of his own actions, including his road rage en route to his destinations as well as social media posts detailing his violent intentions, Amy Doukoure, Council on American-Islamic Relations-Michigan staff attorney, told The New Arab. “This was really good police work,” Doukoure said. “He was really public with his threats, and they were able to track his movements quickly.” Doukoure believes Michigan has become a target of anti-Muslim violence due to a high level of media attention this year, including news of two newly elected Muslim mayors and an all-Muslim council – in addition to the presence of Congresswoman Rashida Tlaib. “The media has really hyped this area up. There is a large population of Muslims,” she said. “People are being very cautious. There have been threats against certain masjids.” During the ongoing holy month of Ramadan people were exercising extra caution due to the vulnerability posed by large crowds. POLL “I just think it’s important for people to know that during Ramadan people are coming together at this holy time,” she said. “We want everyone out here to be safe. We’re fasting all day, and it tends to be very festive at night.”
