Operatives of the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC) have vowed to intensify the fight against the illegal refining of crude oil in Rivers State. Spokesperson of the command, Olufemi Ayodele, stated this while parading the suspects, between the ages of 31 and 49, and displaying the impounded vehicles and products at the Corps Headquarters in Port Harcourt. Ayodele said operatives of the command deployed to parts of the state intercepted and recovered (103,800) litres of diesel suspected to be illegally refined and being transported in small vehicles and trucks to different locations within and outside Rivers State, in the period under review. The products displayed were concealed in plastic bags, a common tactic by the criminals to beat security checks. Ayodele said 14 suspects were arrested for either transporting the products on land and on waterways, or being in possession of aluminum materials used in the fabrication of Illegal refineries. Accordingto him, the suspects were arrested in Obio/Akpor, Ahoada East, Ikwerre, Degema and Port Harcourt Local Government Areas. He said two wooden boats, four trucks, and four cars were also impounded in the operation, adding that the suspects will be prosecuted according to the law.
