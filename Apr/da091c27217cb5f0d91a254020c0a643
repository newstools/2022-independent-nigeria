ABUJA – Efforts to reflate the Nigerian economy have seen the Bank of Industry (BoI) disbursing over N1.24 trillion to 4.2 mil­lion beneficiaries drawn from the micro, small, medium and large enterprises. This initiative has also elicited commendations from President Muhammadu Bu­hari, who estimates that the bank has created over nine million jobs in the last seven years. The commendation came just as the president was com­missioning the Second Tower of the BoI building, in Abuja. President Buhari said the bank has continued to success­fully execute its mandate as a policy institution of the Fed­eral Government, extending single-digit interest rate loans to manufacturers. He also lauded the manage­ment of the Ministry of Indus­try, Trade and Investment and the BoI for what he described as invaluable contributions to the economic development of the country and the wellbeing of Nigerians. “To further enhance its capac­ity to impact the industrial sector on a transformational scale, I ap­proved theissuanceof asovereign guarantee to help the bank raise fundsintheEurobondmarket. “I am glad to note that the bank has recently completed the transaction by raising 750 million Euros from interna­tional investors. “The proceeds of this Euro­bond will be disbursed to large, medium & small enterprises, and women entrepreneurs with bankable projects. POLL “It is commendable that the bank sources its own funds for lending based on its invest­ment-grade ratings by the rat­ing agencies.”
