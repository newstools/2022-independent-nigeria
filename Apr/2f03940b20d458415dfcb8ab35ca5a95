OWERRI – Civil society organizations in Imo State have rejected the ruling of an Owerri Magistrate Court, presided over by Adekibe Esq., that two stolen but recovered babies be handed back to the suspect on the ground that there was no other claimant to the babies other than the suspect, Chinyere Ohanyere, who is also the first accused person in the matter. In a release made available to newsmen in Owerri and which was signed by Maureen Udeagha, Head, Child Protection and Communication, the CSOs under the auspices of the South- East/South-South Civil Society Forum, in reaction to the ruling of the magistrate, also faulted the courts judgment on the grounds that the court in clear terms ignored the fact of the information filed and brought to her notice, notifying it of the case being a sub-set of same matter and subject also pending before an Owerri High Court, which has higher jurisdiction and insisted on going on with hearing, and then ruling on the matter. Speaking on behalf of the civil society groups, Tombari Dumka-Kote, Founder, Centre for Justice, Empowerment & Development (C4J) and a member of the NAPTIP Task Force on Anti-Human Trafficking, said they were displeased with the ruling as it exposed vulnerable children to greater danger of being stolen and trafficked, and an encouragement to human traffickers in and around the state. Dumka-Kote said the discharge and acquittal of the suspects by the court, while another key suspects bail was declined in same matter by an Owerri High Court puts the integrity of the magistrate to test, leaving the question of why the hasty ruling by the lower court without granting the application for a DNA test to be carried out to ascertain the claims of the first defendant. He insisted that the court ruling is not in the best interest of the children as enshrined in the Child Rights Act (2003), but an amputation of the judicial system, as the court has done the biddings of the Imo State Attorney- General and Commissioner for Justice, Cyprian Akaolisa, whose office after filing a motion on notice at the High Court, had denied same through the Prosecution Counsel. In his reaction, Thank- God Robinson of the Child Protection Network (CPN), described the action of the office of the Attorney-General and Commissioner for Justice as a deliberate ploy by the Imo State Government to frustrate the matter and deny the infant children justice, alleging that the AG speaking from both sides of his mouth through his counsel is corruption. Robinson told newsmen, that the CSOs forum would file a formal complaint against the magistrate before the Judicial Service Commission, the Nigerian Bar Association to investigate the reasons for the magistrates alleged hasty and unprofessional ruling on the matter without a DNA test being carried out on the children. It would be recalled that 55-year old Chinyere Ohanyere, popularly known as Madam Chichi, and Ngozi Egbuson Ebuzoaju, a nurse, were arrested in October 2021 for alleged stealing and trafficking two children suspected to have been stolen from a yet to be disclosed location in Rivers State, and were arraigned before an Owerri Magistrate Court in suite Nos. OW/54C/2021 between the Commissioner of Police Vs Ebuzoaju, and at Owerri Magistrate Court in suit No. OW/505C/2021 Commissioner of Police Vs Chinyere and Anor, which is now consolidated in suit No. HOW/86C/2021, State Vs Ngozi Ebuzoaju & Ors. It would be recalled that the civil society groups had first raised the alarm in this matter, in reaction to the statement credited to the office of the Imo State Attorney- General and Commissioner for Justice, Cyprian Akaolisa, and published in some national and online dailies, stating that ‘the state government had ordered the Imo State Police Command to begin a fresh investigation in a case of trafficking of two children in the state.’ The groups then accused the Imo state Attorney-General of being quick in dishing out blames since his move to withdraw the case from court and stop the prosecution of suspects was rejected by civil society groups that raised the alarm that such a move would dent the image of Governor Hope Uzodinma’s administration.
