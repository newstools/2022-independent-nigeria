Lagos – Tijani Babangida, former Super Eagles winger, has applauded the reappointment of Salisu Yusuf as Super Eagles Team B (CHAN) coach. Salisu Yusuf, the coach of Kano Pillars, was on Thursday reappointed as CHAN coach by the Nigeria Football Federation. Babangida believes that there was nothing wrong with the return of Salisu noting that he has the requisite experience to be redeployed to the team he earlier led to the final of CHAN where he lost 4-0 to Morocco. “Not only him that they called back; Ladan Bosso also came back and a lot of other. “Yusuf did well the last time he handled the CHAN Eagles and after that, he did not have another chance to handle the team. “I think they want him to go further with the team because of his experience at this level. He is good to make a comeback in the team,” he said. Meanwhile, the redeployment is coming after so many Nigerians have questioned the rationale behind the appointment, saying the coach, who had also been part of the Super Eagles set up that failed to qualify Nigeria for the 2022 World Cup in Qatar, does not deserve to be so re-appointed. The critics noted that after failure of the country to qualify for the World Cup and the subsequent dissolution of the coaching crew of the mainstream Super Eagles, it was imperative that the exercise also affects Yusuf at the CHAN Eagles.
