A socio-political group in the Akwa Ibom State chapter of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Defenders of Akwa Ibom APC ( DAIA) has strongly condemned the inauguration on Tuesday of a new chairman for the Akwa Ibom chapter of the APC by the new national chairman, Senator Abdullahi Adamu. The group in a statement on Wednesday expressed shock over what it claimed as the deliberate overlook of a court injunction restraining the party from recognizing and inaugurating Obong Stephen Ntukekpo as the chairman of the party. “What has happened is that the leadership of the party has started on the path of illegality and against the desire of the mainstream of the party,” DIAA coordinator, Ibok Essein said. “So long as there existed an injunction against the inauguration of Ntukekpo, it behooved the party’s leadership to have waited for the judicial process to run its course in order not to infringe on the right of everyone concerned and that is why we are especially pained by this development.”Expressing concern that elements from the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) weredictating the situation in the party, DAIA added: “We are concerned that the godfather of the Ntukekpo is the minister of Niger Delta, Senator Godswill Akpabio, a man who as governor so much destroyed the progressives in Akwa Ibom.“It is unfortunate that he has manoeuvered himself into our party and is now destroying our party from inside,” the group said.
