LAGOS – The National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA) has revealed that a vehicle belonging to Skyway Aviation Handling Company (SAHCO) PLC was used by a drug smuggling syndicate to carry out its operations in order to evade security agencies. The anti-narcotic agency said that 1, 584,000 tablets of Tramadol seized on Tuesday, March 15, 2022 which was imported from Pakistan was smuggled through the airport tarmac using one of the vehicles of SAHCO, intercepted at the Federal Airports Authority of Nigeria (FAAN) Personnel Yard. Two suspects, Ofijeh John Mowa, a SAHCO driver and Nyam Gazu Alex, a security guard with the Nigerian Aviation Handling Company (NAH­CO), were arrested in connection with the seizure by NDLEA operatives in collaboration with Aviation Security (AVSEC) and the Nigeria Customs Service personnel at the airport. The seizure includes 17 cartons of 250mg Tramadol branded as “Tamra” weighing 669.70kg and five cartons of 225mg Tramadol under the brand name “Royal” with a gross weight of 217.15kg. The NDLEA spokesman, Femi Babafemi, said a string of fresh of­fensives against drug cartels across Nigeria led to the arrest of a fleeing drug kingpin heading the syndicate operating at the Murtala Muhammed International Airport (MMIA), Ikeja Lagos and six other members of his gang. Further investigations by NDLEA operatives however led to the arrest of five other persons involved in the crime including the ringleader, Yunana Fidelis, who fled Lagos to Kaduna the moment their lid was blown open. Others were Adesanwo Temitope; Owoseni Taiwo Temidayo; Fasoranti Shola and Bamigbade Jonathan. “Yunana Fidelis who is also a staff of NACHO had escaped and fled to Ka­duna after depositing N19, 800,000.00 cash with a BDC operator to be paid later into his bank account.”
