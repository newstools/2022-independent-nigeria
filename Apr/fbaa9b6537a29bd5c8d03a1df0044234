One of the virtuous and very bold women in the polity, who is not in any way deterred by the long domineering posture of their male counterparts, is the ever-resourceful, adventurous and very positively ambitious Chief Ayotunde Lawal, the dutiful and very industrious wife of the equally officious and resourceful chairman of the upwardly mobile Seagle Properties Development Company Limited, Otunba Saheed Yemi Lawal. This woman of valour and former beauty queen has taken the bold step to join the fray of participatory politics, having noticed keenly the very low and abysmal level of women’s participation in politics, even though she herself has been actively participating in politics in her Iperu-Remo homestead and constituency for some time. She is now coming out brave, bold and ever-ready to face the Herculean task by diving headlong into the murky waters of politics. Very optimistic Ayotunde Lawal will be, from all indications, testing the ground to contest the Federal House of Representatives seat ofher Remo Federal Constituency, on the platform of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) come 2023. As if she knew her onions, Ayotunde has many things to work for her when the real race begins in earnest. For example, she already has solid alliances with the current administration in her avowed mission to clinch the NASS seat. Politically, she will be drawing from the rich fountain of her elder blood brother, Chief Doyin Okupe and her good and very mutual relationship with fellow party members across all boards, and good standing within her immediate community, who have been benefitting largely both in cash and kind from her benevolence and immeasurable generosity, even long before she even thought of the idea of participatory politics, and of course the goodwill which her immediate illustrious family enjoys from the good people of Iperu Remo and its environs, and a relatively financial war chest to boost her campaign, all of which will come in handy and in her favour when the chips are down. The indefatigable House of Reps hopeful is a holder of many prestigious traditional chieftaincy titles too numerous to mention and is committed to making her mission for the plum seat in the Green Chambers very possible, realisable, and outlandishly successful.
