Other defendants in the trial are a deputy director in the Ministry of Interior, F. O Alayebami; one Mahmood Ahmadu (at large), and the contracting firm given the recruitment job, Drexel Tech Nigeria Ltd. However, thecourtdischarged and acquitted Abba Moro of the remaining four counts upon which he entered defence. Meanwhile, Justice Dimgba has deferred sentencing of Mrs. Anastasia Daniel-Nwobia to April 27. The former permanent secretary was convicted on count four of the charge, which the court noted, carries maximum jail term of five years without an option of fine. The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), arraigned the immediate past Interior Minister, Abba Moro, and others on an 11-count charge bordering on obtaining by false pretense, procurement fraud and money laundering. They were ab initio arraigned before Justice Anwuli Chikere of the Federal High Court, Abuja, for their roles in the Immigration recruitment. The EFCC accused the defendants of defrauding 676,675 Nigerian applicants of N676,675,000. Each of the 676,675 applicants were charged N1000 each for participating in the recruitment exercise. The anti-graft agency also accused the defendants of flouting the Public Procurement Act, No. 65 of 2007 in the award of the contract for the organisation of the recruitment test to Drexel Tech Nigeria Ltd. However, the court had in a ruling on a no-case submission filed by Moro, dismissed seven counts and ordered him to enter defence on four counts bordering on public procurement aspect of the charges.
