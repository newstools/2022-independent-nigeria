The people of Ondo State have been assured of more government impactful development in spite of the dwindling revenue accruing to the state from the Federation Account. The Chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Ondo State, Engr. Ade Adetimehin, gave the assurance on Sunday in Akure, the Ondo State capital, while congratulating Christians in the state on the Easter celebration. In a statement signed by the party’s Publicity Secretary, Alex Kalejaye, the APC chairman “assures residents, irrespective of religious affiliation, that the state Government would always pursue policies and programmes that have positive bearings on all, urging them to reciprocate by being supportive of the government.” Adetimehin, therefore, urged Christians in the state to identify love, hope, and sacrifice as the key significance of the season. He applauded Christians for their fervent prayers, which he said had helped the state and the country in general, in good measure, urging them not to relent. The APC chieftain acknowledged the uncommon harmony between the ruling party and Christians in the state, saying the success story of the APC-led government won’t have been possible without them. He, therefore, prayed that “the resurrection power of our Lord Jesus be with you all.”
