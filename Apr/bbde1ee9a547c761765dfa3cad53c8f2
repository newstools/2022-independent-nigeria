Independent Petroleum Marketers Association of Nigeria (IPMAN) has expressed sadness over the diversion of petroleum products meant for the South Eastern states to other parts of the country, particularly Lagos and Abuja. Alhaji Debo Ahmed, National President of IPMAN, made the observation in Aba, Abia State during the inuauguration of the new Exco of the South Eastern Zone of IPMAN. Represented by the National Secretary of the association, John Ekekeocha, Debo noted with dismay that this anomaly had not only made petroleum products to be scare in the area, but also made the prices to go high. According to him, it was wrong to take the quota of products meant for the East, where the oil come from to other places, thereby subjecting the people to untold hardship. He urged Nigeria National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) to do something to stop the diversion. Ahmed, who said the Federal Government increased the prices of petroleum products, attributed the current scarcity of products to the recent importation of bad petroleum products into the country. The scarcity was easing and was optimistic that without a short, prices of petroleum products would normalize. Speaking, New chairman of the South Eastern Zone of IPMAN, Bobby Eberechi Dick said his major task would be to interface with officials of NNPC to checkmate the diversion. POLL He vowed to engage NNPC on discussion on how to ensure that petroleum products pumping to Aba depot, which was stopped over the years, resumes. He said the new executive would cooperate with security agents to curb the activities of pipeline vandals which he said was the most challenging problem facing the zone.
