Russia banned UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson and other senior ministers from entering the country on Saturday. This move comes because of the UK’s “hostile” stance on the ongoing Russian invasion of Ukraine. Apart from Johnson, Foreign secretary Liz Truss, Defence Secretary Ben Wallace, Conservative MP and former British Prime Minister Theresa May and 9 other senior politicians – mostly members of the Cabinet – have also been barred from entering Russia. Moscow says that the decision has been made in retaliation to the UK’s sanctions against it since Russia invaded Ukraine on February 24. Russia had imposed a similar ban against US President Joe Biden in March this year. In its statement, Russia’s foreign ministry said, “London’s unbridled information and political campaign aimed at isolating Russia internationally, creating conditions for containing our country and strangling the domestic economy were responsible for its decision.” It further added, “In essence, the British leadership is deliberately aggravating the situation around Ukraine, pumping the Kyiv regime with lethal weapons and coordinating similar efforts on the part of Nato.” Earlier this week, both the UK and US imposed further sanctions on Moscow, which included financial measures designed to damage Russia’s already struggling economy and penalise Russian President Putin, high-ranking officials, and people who have benefitted from his regime.
