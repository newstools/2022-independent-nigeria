LAGOS – The Inspector-General of Police, IGP Usman Alkali Baba in a bid to restrategise for better security networking in Nigeria has acquired 55 additional Lorries, 5 water tankers, 2 coaster buses and 15 Armoured Personnel Car­riers (APCs) to aid strategic deployment of tactical squads to tackle insecurity across the length and breadth of the country, especially in the cri­sis affected areas. The IGP, who has reiterated his commitment to continual­ly provide necessary welfare and safer environment for po­lice operatives at the forefront in crisis areas, immediately directed that the logistics and assets be made available for the ongoing serial operations being executed by the police at strategic locations in the county. Also, IGP Usman Alkali Baba, has released adequate funds to upgrade the police ICT platforms to the required status, capable of combating the present security issues and realities in Nigeria as such will go a long way in alleviating the operational challenges of police troops on various tactical operations in Nigeria. He equally directed the Police Airwing to step up its platforms and logistics to pro­vide air support to the ground troops whenever they are on operation in the six geo-polit­ical zones in Nigeria. The Police boss however appealed to the general pub­lic not to panic in view of the heavily armed Police tactical squads who have been de­ployed for various operations, as they have been warned to be professional, civil and to operate within the ambit of the law. He also sought for maximum cooperation with the police operatives in many areas, especially information sharing, in order to make the operations successful. The IGP emphatically re­stated his zeal to fight crimi­nal elements who are bent on neutralising and truncating the security system, peace and harmony we deserve in this country.
