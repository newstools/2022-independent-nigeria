Detained Ukrainian pro-Russia opposition party leader Viktor Medvedchuk on Monday called on Ukrainian and Russian leaders to exchange him for civilians and troops in Mariupol, the besieged southeastern port city. “Exchange me with the residents and defenders of Mariupol who are deprived of their right to a safe-exit through humanitarian corridors,” he said in a video published by the Ukrainian Security Service (SBU). Medvedchuk is the leader of the pro-Russian Ukraine’s Opposition Platform – For Life party, and was put under house arrest in May 2021 on suspicion of treason. The wealthy businessman, however, is said to have escaped shortly after Russia began its war on Ukraine on Feb. 24. But he was again arrested by the SBU last week. Ukrainian authorities say Medvedchuk is a close friend of Russian President Vladimir Putin, who describes him as a “Ukrainian nationalist.” According to the World Food Program, the encircled city of Mariupol is thought to be running out of its last reserves of food and water, and thousands of people are believed to be trapped there.
