Nigerian celebrity Cosmetic Dentist and CEO Whitenlighten Ltd., Samuel Tinno Paul better known as Tinnostiles have made history as he becomes the first-ever Nigerian and African Cosmetic Dentist to perform a Platinum Laser Teeth Whitening Procedure on a yacht. The hour-long procedure which took place on April 1st 2022 at Marina in Dubai was performed on a Turkish actress on a South Beach Lifestyle luxury yacht. The multidimensional Cosmetic Dentist, showbiz promoter and Business Executive who has continued to trail the blaze in his field is currently on a tour with his team in Dubai during which he broke the new record. Tinnostiles, who was a full-time showbiz promoter revealed that he became a Cosmetic Dentist after he underwent a Cosmetic Dental training program in the United States. He added that his passion, hard work and commitment to impact the world by giving everyday people and celebrities all over the world bigger smiles drove him to achieve this record-breaking feat. Sharing some of the hurdles he has had to scale, he said: “One of the major challenges of being a celebrity dentist is that it has made me a frequent traveller; I’m always on the move due to high booking rates from different States and different countries. Most of the time, I am on the move with my team. We sometimes book our flights very late and it is often very expensive and at other times, we are forced to travel by road which is usually very risky.” Speaking further, he disclosed that his services are affordable but not inexpensive: “We’re affordable but we’re not inexpensive because we operate a luxury dental lounge and we offer world-class quality service. I am a man of integrity and I ensure all our clients get the best.” The young Nigerian isn’t resting on his oars as he vows to open more dental lounges across Nigeria and in major cities in the world while also breaking more records that will set his brand on a global pedestal.
