Ivanka Trump is set to testify Tuesday before a House panel investigating the Jan. 6 riot at the Capitol whose members want to ask the former president’s daughter her recollections that day from inside the White House, according to a person familiar with the matter. Her testimony, expected to be conducted by video link, follows last week’s interview by the committee of her husband, ex-White House adviser Jared Kushner. Although he was traveling back to the U.S. from abroad when the Capitol riot began, Kushner was questioned remotely for more than six hours by the committee. A spokesman for Ivanka Trump has not returned messages. The interview was reported earlier by NBC News. Ivanka Trump was a White House adviser to former President Donald Trump. The Jan. 6 committee’s chairman, Democratic Representative Bennie Thompson of Mississippi, has said other witness testimony placed her in the Oval Office during during some moments on Jan. 6 and the days leading up to it. Thompson has previously written to Ivanka Trump that the panel wants her voluntary cooperation “on a range of critical topics.” Those include conversations Trump had Jan. 6 with his vice president, Mike Pence, and why quicker action wasn’t taken on Jan. 6 to help stop the violence at the Capitol.
