We equally commend and appreciate the synergy between the government, British Council, Civil Society Organizations, the formal and informal security institutions in the Northeast sub-region that are saddled with the responsibility of promoting peace, security and ensuring public safety especially in addressing conflicts, insurgency and other types of violence in the sub-region in particular and other parts of the country in general”. The monarch said that history has always revealed that the traditional institution was the system of administration even before the colonial era. “This institution was fully recognized and considered a viable system by the British colonists who re-shaped it by imposing an indirect rule system of administration. Traditional Rulers were critical to the administrative system in various fields of human endeavour at that time, especially in maintaining law and order, community policing, generating internal revenue and also responsible for the custody of religion, culture and traditions “. On his part, the State Team Lead of the Managing Conflict in Northeast Nigeria Programme funded by the European Union and implemented by the British Council, Sambo Abdulkadir appreciated the support of the traditional institution and pledged to sustain the partnership for the benefit of the citizens.
