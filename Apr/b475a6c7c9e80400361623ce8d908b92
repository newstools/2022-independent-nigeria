Istanbul’s Hagia Sophia Mosque held its first Ramadan night prayers in 88 years on Friday, with the arrival of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, Yeni Akit newspaper reported. Ali Erbaş, the head of Turkey’s the Religious Affairs Directorate, led the prayers unique to the month of fasting attended by hundreds of people, it said, while thousands flocked to the mosque. In 2020, Turkey converted the UNESCO-listed site which was initially an Orthodox Christian cathedral, into a mosque, in move that was met with international criticism. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan announced the conversion of the structure, originally built as a Byzantine cathedral in 537, after the Council of State, Turkey’s highest administrative court, ruled that the building’s conversion to a museum by modern Turkey’s founding statesman was illegal. The Hagia Sophia was turned into a mosque following the Ottoman conquest of Istanbul on May 29, 1453, and then became a museum in 1935 under Mustafa Kemal Atatürk’s presidency. The Hagia Sophia Mosque had been closed for prayers as part of COVID-19 restrictions, except for a ceremony marking its inauguration attended by Erdoğan in July 2020. The mosque was illuminated with lights strung between minarets known as Mahya, Yeni Akit said, a decoration unique to the month of Ramadan. The Muslim month of Ramadan ends on May 1, ushering in the three-day holiday of Eid-ul-Fitr.
