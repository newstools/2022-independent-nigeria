ABUJA – President of the Senate, Ahmad Lawan, has called on the police and law enforcement agencies to investigate the death of gospel artiste, Osinachi Nwachukwu. Lawan’s call preceded a minute silence observed by the Upper Chamber in honour of the deceased. The Senate President said that the life of every Nigerian citizen matters and must be accounted for by security agencies and relevant authorities where death occurs. On his part, Senator Ifeanyi Ubah (Anambra South), standing on Order 42 of the Senate Standing Orders on Personal Explanation, drew the attention of the chamber to the mysterious death of the singer. Accordingly, Senator Lawan, reacting to the widely reported news of her demise, the Senate President called for an investigation to unravel the actual cause of death. He said, “The authorities should investigate the death of this citizen, and the lives of every citizen must matter. This is one death too many.” Osinachi Nwachukwu was alleged to have died as a result of internal injuries sustained from domestic violence meted on her by her husband, Mr. Peter Nwachukwu. The gospel artiste was reportedly said to have died last week Friday, on the 8th of April, 2022, at the National Hospital, Abuja, where she was hospitalized after going into a coma for days.
