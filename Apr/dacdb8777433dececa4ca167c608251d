Liverpool forward Diogo Jota is a doubt for this weekend’s FA Cup semi-final clash with Manchester City. Less than a week after they met in the Premier League, Pep Guardiola and Jurgen Klopp’s sides will face off once again, with this weekend’s prize a place in the final of the FA Cup. City twice led against Liverpool last Sunday but ended up sharing the spoils, however, a winner must be decided on Saturday when the two teams lock horns once more. Both sides were in Champions League action on Wednesday night and both managed to progress, meaning they could yet meet in the Champions League final. When asked about injury news ahead of Saturday’s Wembley outing, Klopp explained that his side have one big doubt ahead of the match. “Diogo has a good chance he will be all right but we need to have a look tomorrow,” he explained. “That’s it.” Mohamed Salah did not start against Benfica on Wednesday but played a part later in the game, and Klopp told the press that this was always his plan. When asked about the 29-year-old, Klopp added: “Even if Mo would have scored four goals in the last game, he wouldn’t have started (vs Benfica). “There’s no story, just a necessity. Even he is just a human being and there’ll be games where he can’t start or is taken off and he hates that – that’s clear. “Some of the defending was a bit flat-footed and we’re waiting for offside. But in general, the intensity of the game (vs Benfica) showed it was right to make seven changes.”
