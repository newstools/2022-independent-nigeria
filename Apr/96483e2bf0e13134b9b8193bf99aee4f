Edo State Governor, Mr. Godwin Obaseki at this year’s Annual Investment Meeting (AIM) in Dubai, thrilled investors with his pitch for investments in the Benin River Port, the Enterprise Park, and the Benin Inland Container Depot/Dry Port, among other big-ticket projects, in a drive to deepen development and open up the state’s economy for productivity and industrialisation. The governor is among members of the Nigeria Governors’ Forum (NGF) participating in the annual summit and seeking foreign direct investments from businesses and organisations in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Others on the delegation include Governors of Abia, Akwa Ibom, Bauchi, Bayelsa, Cross River, Ekiti, Enugu, Kwara, Niger, Ondo, Plateau, Sokoto and Yobe States. Obaseki, during his presentation, said industrialisation is one of the core pillars of his administration, adding, “We have created much impact in this regard and we will continue to provide the needed environment to spur industrialisation as it has the potential to boost economic growth and development.” Obaseki, who stated that Edo State was fast becoming a destination of choice for foreign investment, paraded the ongoing reforms in the ease of doing business in Edo State, driven by laws that guarantee the security of investments, as well as the signing of a Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) with Ossiomo Power Company to provide stable power to government institutions and drive the state’s industrial sector, among others to ensure the influx of investors into the state. Noting the economic benefits of the Benin River Port and Edo Enterprise Park projects, the governor said his government will continue to push for more of such projects to ensure the requisite infrastructure to attract and keep investment and engender inclusive growth. The Annual Investment Meeting (AIM) is an initiative of the UAE Ministry of Economy designed to provide a framework for global exchange on the key principles underpinning international investment policies, strategies and practices for sustainable development to achieve smart and inclusive global growth.  According to the organisers, “Since its inception, the Annual Investment Meeting has established itself as a leading global investment platform that aspires to ignite positive transformation by creating investment opportunities, upholding solidarity and developing economic relations among nations, as well as addressing the global ordeals that will make a profound impact to economic growth.”
