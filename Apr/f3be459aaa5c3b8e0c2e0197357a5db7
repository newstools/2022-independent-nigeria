LAGOS  – The Nourishing AfricaEntrepreneur Support Programme, launched in partnership with the Mastercard Foundation, which focuses on small-scale enterprises, is currently wrapping up activities for the initiative. The initiative started in December 2020 and has trained over 1,000 young Nigerian agri-food entrepreneurs, helping them to improve their business operations and become resilient and adaptive agribusinesses. The programme, targeted at young people between the ages of 20 and 40 (57% of which are women),is engaged in critical food and cash crops and livestock value chains, from the provision of inputs and primary production to processing, logistics, storage, and distribution in 11 states in Nigeria: Abia Anambra, Delta, Edo, FCT, Kaduna, Kano, Lagos, Ogun, Osun, and Oyo states. The programme has provided knowledge and support to these Nigerian grassroots SMEs to help them pivot and recover from the effects of COVID-19 on their businesses, keeping employees engaged and assisting them to emerge from this crisis even stronger.
