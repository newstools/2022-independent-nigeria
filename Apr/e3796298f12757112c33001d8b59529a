Nemanja Matic has announced that he will leave Manchester United at the end of the current season. The 33-year-old midfielder has spent five years at Old Trafford, having joined in 2017, but will seek a new challenge this summer. Matic announced the decision with a post on Instagram on Friday night. It read: “After a great deal of thought, I have decided that this season will be my last with Manchester United. “I have informed the board, the manager and the players of my decision. “It has been a huge honour and a privilege to play for this great club. “A big thank you to the fans for their unwavering support. “I will now give everything until the end of the season to help my teammates finish as strongly as possible.” POLL When Matic initially joined United in 2017, it was on a three-year contract. In 2020, they took up an option to extend this by a year, and then agreed a new deal to keep him at the club until 2023. Now though, this arrangement will be cut short by a season as he is set to leave this summer instead. During his time at Old Trafford, Matic has not won any major trophies and experienced defeats in the 2018 FA Cup final (to Chelsea) and 2021 Europa League final (to Villarreal).
