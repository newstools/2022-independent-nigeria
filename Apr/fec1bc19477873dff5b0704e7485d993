AWKA – Elder brother of Obi Cubana, Ikenna Iyiegbu, who is aspiring for the Idemili North/South Federal Constituency seat in the Federal House of Representatives in the forthcoming 2023 general election will bring goodwill associated with the Iyiebu family to bear in politics if elected, according to his aide Pastor Favour Onochie. Ikenna, who is an elder brother of Obinna Iyiegbu popularly known as Obi Cubana is aspiring for House of Representatives on the platform of the All Progressive Grand Alliance (APGA). Onochie assured that Ikenna will bring the goodwill of the Iyiegbu family to give Idemili North/South quality representation at Abuja. He was reacting to a statement published in a daily newspaper, not Daily Independent credited to an APGA chieftain in Oba,  Chief Emeka Njeakor who advised Ikenna Iyiebu not to venture into politics because God has blessed the Iyiebu family and the family also has been empowering people all over the place with God’s blessings upon them through philanthropic services and thus the family need not delve into politics. While faulting Njeakor’s stand, Pastor Onochie said that political leadership anywhere in the world requires people of goodwill, people of sound background, people with a track record of success in the credible field of human endeavour and people of the credible reputation such as the Iyiegbu family’s. He noted that it is neither right nor safe to leave political leadership to people of questionable character or people who depend on public office to earn their living. He added: “Considering the situation of things in  Idemili North/South Federal Constituency someone like Ikenna is the ideal to serve the people in the Federal House, so the advice from Chief Njeakor is childish and funny and has to be dismissed because if you ask Ikenna who is a man of goodwill from a credible family not to seek opportunity to render political services to his people, automatically you are making the way for people who are not qualified or people with questionable character to come and occupy political positions “So for me and for us in the Ikenna Iyiegbu team for Idemili North/South seat in the House of Representatives in 2023,  it is a welcome development to have someone from a credible family to come out and offer himself for the service of his people. POLL “So, Njeakor should rather throw his weight behind Ikenna and join hands with us to ensure his victory at the polls next year.”
