No fewer than five persons returning from a Wedding on Easter Monday in Anambra State were kidnapped by unknown gunmen. Daily Independent learned that the five persons had attended the traditional marriage ceremony of a cousin to the Commissioner for Special Duties, Sly Ezeokenwa and were on their way back home when they were kidnapped at gunpoint. The Commissioner said he got to know about the ugly development through a message on his phone detaling that the victims were kidnapped around Akpo community in Aguata Local Council area at about 10pm on Easter Monday. No contact has been established with either the kidnappers or the victims. Commissioner Ezeokenwa said: “The following friends of my cousin – Sampson Okafor, Chidozie Eze, Franklin Osuuagu, Chijioke Uduba, Benedict Ozoagwu who visited for his traditional marriage on Monday were kidnapped at gunpoint at about 10pm last night in Udo Village, Akpo (Aguata LGA) along Akpo – Nkpologwu road about 300m to Akpo Junction. We are yet to establish any contact with the victims.” The Police spokesman in Anambra State Toochukwu Ikenga, a Deputy Supretendent of Police (DSP) confirmed the report. He said the command has launched an operation to rescue the abducted persons, and that the commissioner has also been contacted over the matter. According to Ikenga: “The command has already made contact to the Honorable Commissioner for special duties, Mr. Sly Ezeonkenwa and operation is currently ongoing for possible rescue of the victims,” he said. POLL In recent times Aguata appeared to be a hotbed of miscreants who had attacked the council headquarters. Just last week, gunmen also attacked the checkpoint at Isuofia, Governor Chukwuma Charles Soludo’s home town killing some policemen.
