ABAKALIKI – The governorship aspirant on the platform of the People’s Dem­ocratic Party (PDP), Anayo Edwin Nwonu, has called for the release of a Catholic priest, Rev. Fr. Tim­othy Ngwuta, from prison custody. Fr. Ngwuta is being held in Abakaliki Correctional Centre over the protracted communal war between the people of Ezza/ Effium, Ohaukwu local govern­ment area of the state. Nwonu, who is representing Ezza North/Ishielu federal con­stituency, Ebonyi State and chair­man, House Committee on Refor­matory Institutions, made the call at the weekend when he visited the cleric at the correctional centre. He described his detention in prison custody as injustice. The people of Ezza and Effium have been at war for over one year with many lives lost and property worth billions of naira destroyed. Rev. Fr. Ngwuta, who was ac­cused of promoting the war, was arrested, charged to court and remanded at the Abakaliki Cor­rectional Centre. He explained that he visited Ngwuta to see what he could do about his release and to know his condition. “I came here on a very private visit to see one of us here that is being remanded here, Rev. Fr. Ng­wuta. I came here to see him and know what we can do about his release. POLL “This is a process that we are undergoing to ensure his freedom. What we are preaching in Ebonyi is that injustice should leave Ebo­nyi State and that is what we stand for. “I am not a Catholic, I am a Pentecostal but church is church. We believe in God and we believe in one God. The most important thing is that an average Ebonyi man is looking for justice,”Nwonu said.
