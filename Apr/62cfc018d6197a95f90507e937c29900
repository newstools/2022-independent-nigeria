Nothing more appropriate while describing the CEO of AirJara Travels and Tours other than ‘Versatility’. Just as we all know that AirJara is one of the best when travels and tours is mentioned, amiable Abi Otedola seems to be looking beyond her flourishing business. Come April 16th, a one-intown entertainment show will hold at Eko Hotels and Suites and AirJara is one of the major sponsors of 10Dollar Show which will feature KennyBlaq as the host, Fireboy DML, Kaffy and other popular artistes will be on ground to thrill people. 10Dollar show, according to Abi, is a step into the entertainment industry. “I’m an entertainer and I love music passionately.” She also promises that AirJara will involve and support entertainment the more.
