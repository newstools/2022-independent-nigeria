A rally in support of ousted Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan was held after iftar in Ilford, east London on Monday. Dozens, perhaps hundreds of protestors in support of Imran Khan gathered and chanted slogans of ‘Pakistan Zindabad’ (Long live Pakistan) and ‘Imran Khan Zindabad’ (Long live Imran Khan), and accused the traditional political parties – which helped remove him of office – of widespread corruption. Imran Khan has called to mobilise his supporters to fight back against the old guard that have retaken control of Pakistan’s government after Khan was removed from office in a no-confidence vote last week. He repeated his allegations at a rally in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province in northern Pakistan that he was removed by a foreign-backed conspiracy on Twitter, and demanded immediate elections. “On Wednesday I will be holding a jalsa (public rally) in Peshawar after Isha – my first jalsa after being removed through a foreign-instigated regime change. I want all our people to come, as Pakistan was created as an independent, sovereign state not as a puppet state of foreign powers,” he tweeted. “We are demanding immediate elections as that is the only way forward — to let the people decide, through fair & free elections, whom they want as their prime minister.” he added in another. Hundreds of people have gathered around the world in a show of support for Imran Khan, many of whom believe Khan can help rid the country of its traditionally corrupt leaders. The new Pakistani Prime Minister is Shehbaz Sharif, the brother of former PM Nawaz Sharif who in 2018 was found guilty of corruption and sentenced to 10 years in prison. Nawaz Sharif served six months in prison before moving to London on medical grounds. Dozens of Khan’s supporters protested outside the residence of former Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif in Mayfair London, whose party was one of those that orchestrated the no-confidence vote against Khan.
