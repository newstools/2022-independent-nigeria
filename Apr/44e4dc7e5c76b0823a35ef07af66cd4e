The leader of INRI Evangelical Spiritual Church Primate Elijah Ayodele has warned Governor Nyesom Wike about picking his successor in 2023. In a statement by his Media Aide, Oluwatoyin Osho, the clergyman noted that Wike should seek the face of God in choosing the next governor of the state. Ayodele said Wike’s successor is around him but the governor could choose the wrong person if care isn’t taken. Prophet Ayodele said, “The next governor of Rivers State is around you, don’t pick the wrong person who will become your enemy, seek the face of God in everything you are doing, try to harmonize, bring everyone together to retain the state. “If you don’t do the right thing, those you depend on will betray you, work in accordance with your party.” He also warned the Peoples Democratic Party, National Chairman, Iyorchia Ayu, against endorsing a consensus candidate for the party’s presidential ticket in 2023. Ayodele said the party’s national chairman would be fought by those who installed him because of what they want him to achieve. He advised the party to make its presidential ticket open instead of consensus. POLL “Those who installed the chairman of the party will begin to fight him, what they want him to achieve is very difficult. If he wants a successful tenure, he must be very transparent. PDP should throw their presidential ticket open irrespective of any agenda, consensus is not the right thing,” he said.
