David de Gea is relishing facing Liverpool on Tuesday evening as Manchester United prepare for a testing trip to Merseyside. Nineteen points currently separate the sides in the Premier League standings as the Red Devils prepare for their latest visit to Anfield – a ground they have not won at since January 2016. Liverpool are the overwhelming favourites to come out on top once again against their rivals as they look to continue their quest for top spot. United have struggled to impose themselves when taking on the big-hitters of the division, though De Gea is hopeful Ralf Rangnick’s side can take ‘confidence’ from beating Norwich City to put in a strong performance at the home of the Reds. “It’s going to be a tough game for sure,” De Gea told MUTV. “It’s always special to play against Liverpool, even away. It’s great to be there and play. “Let’s see. We will go there and hopefully today give us confidence to go on Tuesday and play well, try to win the game and hopefully win the points for Manchester.” Despite having only won two of their previous six league outings, United remain in the hunt for a top four place due to both Arsenal and Tottenham Hotspur falling to defeat at the weekend. Refusing to give up hope of securing a place in next season’s Champions League, De Gea added: “This is the Premier League, it’s not easy. Every game is tough. “You see today against Norwich, bottom of the league, but they fight, they nearly get points here. It’s good for us if (our top-four rivals) drop points but, like I said, we need to keep improving, just focus on ourselves and keep winning games until the last one.”
