Barcelona are still recovering from their battering against Eintracht Frankfurt on Thursday. With their Monday night fixture against Cadiz an opportunity to put the Europa League exit behind them, the Catalans will have to do so with a potentially fragile defence. Star defenders Ronald Araujo and Gerard Pique will be missing for the match. The Uruguayan picked up a yellow card against Levante last week and is suspended for the match, while Pique is still recovering from discomfort that has kept him out of the last few games. The means that Xavi Hernandez only has three natural central defenders at his disposal as noted by Mundo Deportivo, with Samuel Umtiti still unavailable. Eric Garcia will be a favourite to start, but alongside him will be a choice between Clement Lenglet and Oscar Mingueza. The latter has seen more minutes than Lenglet this season, but has seen most of those minutes as part of a back three or at full-back. The Frenchman would perhaps be considered he more logical choice, but has made just four substitute appearances since January, conceding a penalty against Levante last week immediately after coming on.
