Wisdom Macaulay, brother to the Nigerian actress, Annie Idibia, has begged for forgiveness for calling his sister a drug addict and claiming that she maltreated him. He pleaded with the Idibia’s family and to his mother in a video which was posted on Saturday via social media, expressing that he was scared that his source of income will be taken from him which was what led to him making those false statements. He further urged entertainers in the Nollywood industry to help him beg Annie, as he is sorry for his actions. “My sister Annie is not on any form of drugs and I have never seen it with her. I am not on drugs either. “I have come to realize that the route I took wasn’t the right one. It is just a whole lot going on and to feel that your food, your source of income is being taken from you is what led me lay those false allegations against my family member. I am truly and deeply sorry again.” Recall that Wisdom in a viral video revealed that his life is being threatened by Annie who he works for but gets treated like a slave. However, Annie refuted the claims, recounting how she helped her brother and his family in secret occasions.
