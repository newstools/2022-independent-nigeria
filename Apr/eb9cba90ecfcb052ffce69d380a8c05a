LAGOS – The South West Agenda for Asiwaju 2023 (SWAGA’23), a group canvassing for the emergence of Asiwaju Bola Tinubu as President in 2023 on Wednesday said it is happy with the decision reached by the  National Executive Committee (NEC) of the All Progressives Congress (APC) that the presidential candidate of the party will be chosen through an indirect primary election. Speaking with DAILY INDEPENDENT, Hon. Bosun Oladele, the National Secretary of SWAGA said the movement is happy because they know Tinubu has the popularity to win the presidential primary owing to his capacity and popularity across the country. While lauding NEC for the decision, Oladele said the indirect primary option will deepen internal democracy and ensure peace in the party as no aspirant will feel cheated as with the case of consensus which can be imposed on unwilling members. He said: “We are happy as a movement that the party has decided based on the yearnings of the party members. The decision of the party will not only ensure fair play, it will further deepen internal democracy within the party. “It will also mean that regardless of the outcome of the primary, everybody will be in one accord and there will be peace in the party. This is because nobody will feel cheated which will be the case if consensus is imposed on them. “We said it before that people should be allowed to test their capacity. We know the principal that we are following. When he came out to say that I have the capacity to lead Nigeria, it was not a frivolous statement. It was deliberately chosen and spoken. “Capacity is the number one attribute any leader should exhibit. So, we are happy that with indirect primary, everybody will be able to test their popularity at the convention. “For us in SWAGA, it means that we have been working and we will keep on working until our goal is achieved.”
