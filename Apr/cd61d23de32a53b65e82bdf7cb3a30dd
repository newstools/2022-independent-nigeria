Those who are reading this for the first time must be wondering what fastidious rule a billionaire of Otunba Mike Adenuga Jnr.’s status must have broken to honour a friend and family of many years. Yes, the Globacom boss did break his long term abhorrence for attending social functions or gatherings, as the Bull has stood religiously by this stance for years, except for brief appearances at his mother’s burial a few years ago, and perhaps the weddings of two of his daughters, the last of which held at his Banana Island residence, where he was even sparingly in attendance. But many were surprised last Saturday to see a man of immense means and substance at the traditional wedding in Benin of Osasu Igbinedion, daughter of the former governor of Edo State, Chief Lucky Igbinedion. Many were surprised to see the bulky man live at a social gathering, seated at the same table with the likes of Chief James Ibori and his wife, Deputy Governor of Edo State, Philips Shuaibu and First Lady of Edo State, Besty Obaseki, and other captains of industry that attended the traditional marriage at the palatial country home of Chief Gabriel Osawaru Igbinedion, The Esama of Benin Kingdom. Also at the function was the patriarch of the Igbinedion dynasty. But what still puzzles many is that Chief Igbinedion must have meant a lot to Mike Adenuga for him to break his long-standing unwritten rule to grace an event of such magnitude, even in faraway Benin, Edo State, just to show how filial and important his host is to the family. As you are reading this, the white wedding of the traditional/engagement ceremony comes up today, where many are eagerly waiting to see if the Globacom boss will once again accord his much-regarded friend with his presence.
