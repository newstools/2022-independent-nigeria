Mr. Tunde Mabawonku, the Chief Finance Officer of the bank, noted that “a key measure of success for us is a consistent growth in our balance sheet and customer base – and we are glad that we are reporting healthy growth in all these areas.” Deposit liabilities grew by 15.23 per cent to N927.47 billion in FY 2021 from N804.87 billion in FY 2020 while total assets increased by 20.23 per cent to N1.164.52 billion from N968.58 billion in 2020.

The bank will also continue to focus on our digital business, which is a key boost for customer acquisition, consumer lending and transaction volumes while not neglecting our corporate and commercial play. POLL “ On our commercial business, we will continue our aggressive strategy to improve our lending business alongside trade and other revenue lines. We have also unveiled our new Mission and Vision statements which underpins our corporate strategy. We want to be the dominant digital platform in Africa delivering seamless financial service”.
