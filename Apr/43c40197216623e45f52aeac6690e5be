Lagos – The calls for the resignation of the Amaju Pinnick-led Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) board are in order. This is the position of former Super Eagles goalkeeper, Emmanuel Babayaro, while reacting to the calls in so many quarters for the present board of the NFF. Recall that since the failure of the Super Eagles to qualify for the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar, so many Nigerians have called on the board to throw in the towel. And Babayaro, while in a chat with our correspondent, said much as entire blame should not be on the Amaju-led board, the call for their resignation was in order given that football in the country has not fared better under them. Babayaro, who was part of the Dream Team that won Africa’s first football gold at the Olympic Games when it was hosted at Atlanta Georgia in the United States, said that the calls were not really because the country failed to qualify for the World Cup but because of the declining state of Nigerian football. “They have tried but they have not done enough,” he said. “The management of football generally has not witnessed much improvement in Nigeria since they came on board and I think those calling for their heads are in order. “We should try others and see what they have to offer. Yes the Super Eagles failed when we needed them most but it is not about the Qatar World Cup now; it is about the all round football management in the country,” he said.
