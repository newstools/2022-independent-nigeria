Commendations have contin­ued to come the way of the 19-year-old 200m record holder, Favour Ofili, after he threw to the trash can the record previ­ously held by Blessing Okag­bare. Olympic gold medallist, Chioma Ajunwa, an Olympic gold medalist, and Tonebok Okowa, president of the Ath­letics Federation of Nigerian (AFN), gave kudos to Ofili af­ter her 200m record breaking display at the Tom Jones Me­morial Classic 2022 in Florida on Friday. Ofili ran a blazing 21.96secs to finish first in the 200m event, breaking Okagbare’s national record of 22.04secs that had stood since 2018. With the time of 21.96secs, Ofili became the second wom­an in African history to go sub 22 in the 200m joining Nambian Olympic silver medalist Chris­tine Mboma who holds a per­sonal best of 21.78secs. The 19-year-old also became the first Nigerian woman to run under 22secs in a 200 me­tres race as well as becoming the first collegian athlete to ever go sub 22secs leapfrogging the 22.02 set by Florida’s Kyra Jef­ferson at the 2017 NCAA Cham­pionships. Ajunwa who was pleased with Ofili’s record breaking feat also advised her not to re­lent in practice while calling on the AFN to motivate the athlete. “I have congratulated her for her feat, it is not easy and now all she needs to do is stay con­sistent ahead of the other tour­naments in front of her. I know the sky is just the starting point for her after this achievement and I hope she can maintain the momentum,” Ajunwa said. “The authorities in charge of athletics in the country should also motivate them be­cause that goes a long way in making them better. They need to motivate them with action and not just words,” the former track and field star added. POLL AFN President, Okowa, added that he’s not surprised by her performance due to her incredible work rate.
