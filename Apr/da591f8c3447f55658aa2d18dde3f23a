A lawmaker representing Oyo North Senatorial District, Hon. Fatai  Buhari has called for the urgent relocation of the occupants of the affected communities by the recent Abuja-Kaduna railway attack by terrorists. Buhari stated this during the second Ishak Abiola Ajimobi Ramadan lecture held at the Abiola Ajimobi central mosque Oke-Ado Ibadan recently. While consoling the families of the affected victims of the attack, Buhari called on the Federal Government to construct a military base in the affected areas so as to avoid future occurrences of terrorist attacks. The lawmaker in his message to Muslims all over the country and the world advised Muslims to observe the Ramadan fast with the fear of Allah as it is a way of using the opportunity of the period to supplicate to Allah on how to solve Nigeria’s problems. “I want to advise Muslims all over the country to pray frequently to Allah about the incessant attacks by terrorists, it is by praying to Allah that we can have a lasting solution to the country’s numerous problems. “If the Federal Government can urgently relocate the people of Rijana , Katari, Kasaramati and Jere communities where many lives were lost as a result of the recent bandits attack, the better for the country because we can not fold our arms and see so many lives been lost untimely in the hands of bandits”. Buhari however called on the leadership of the All Progressives Congress (APC) not to allow any form of imposition of candidates while stating that party members should be allowed to choose their representatives based on individual achievements and political antecedents. “Our party have focus and I want to tell you that the recent misunderstandings among members of our party have been resolved and if there is anyone unresolved I want to assure you that we are all one big family and when we get to the river we shall know how to cross it”.
