The Chairman of the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) zoning committee and Governor of Benue State, Samuel Ortom on Wednesday outrightly denied the news reports making rounds that the party has thrown its presidential ticket ahead of the 2023 general election open to all aspirants. Speaking in an interview with Arise TV, Governor Ortom stated that the committee has not jettisoned zoning nor made the ticket available to all presidential hopefuls.

Reacting to the media report, Ortom reiterated his earlier statement that committee members only reached a unanimous agreement on zoning the presidential ticket. The governor stated that a report of the committee will be forwarded to the National Executive Committee of the party. More to come…
