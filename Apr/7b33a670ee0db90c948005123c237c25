Manchester United star Cristiano Ronaldo is set to leave the club when Erik ten Hag is appointed manager. That’s according to the Metro, who say that the 37-year-old legend is not wanted by the Dutchman, who is expected to take over as the new permanent boss at Old Trafford any day now. Ronaldo rejoined the club that he made his name at last summer in an emotional homecoming. The Portuguese capped his second coming with a brace against Newcastle United, with the future looking bright for his second stint in the Premier League. The manager who signed Ronaldo – Ole Gunnar Solksjaer, the forward’s former teammate at United – was sacked in November, with Ralf Rangnick stepping into the hot seat on an interim basis. The German has leant on Ronaldo but does not seem to trust him to quite the same level that Solskjaer did. It is probable that if Erik ten Hag is not impressed with the player, it could be to do with his lack of pressing and all-round prowess as a striker. The Red Devils have struggled with CR7 leading the line, having to adapt their successful style of play from last season around their new star’s talents.
