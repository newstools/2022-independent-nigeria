ABUJA – The presidential ambition of Chukwuemeka Nwajiuba got a surprise start on Wednes­day as a group of young Ni­gerians, numbering about 60, under the aegis of Project Nigeria #HCN, contributed over N100 million to purchase the All Progressives Congress (APC) expression of interest and nomination forms. Led by Chidi Nwogu, the group said it remitted the full amount of the money on Tuesday to the designated bank account of the ruling party and came first thing on Wednesday to pick the forms because of the seriousness of the project. “We have purchased the forms to show the serious­ness of this project. We were the first to pay yesterday. We remitted the money at 10:O’ Clock yesterday and we were the first to pick the form today to show the seriousness of the project. “And the person we have purchased this form for is a very hard working minister, he’s presently at the Federal Executive Council Meeting (FEC), working hard. Af­ter the FEC meeting, this group of young Nigerians will present the forms to him and ask him to run for Presidency.” According to him, Project Nigeria, Eastern Group and 60 other groups all came to­gether under the umbrella Project Nigeria #HCN to ask him to run for Presidency. Nwogu described Nwajiu­ba as a detribalised Nigerian, who he said, has built bridges across the different states and regions of the country. He noted that the Minister and former lawmaker has had vast experience in poli­tics spanning over 30 years de­spite his youthful and humble disposition. “For 30 years he’s been in politics, unblemished, very humble, underscored by his open-door policy. He was a lawmaker and also a very major supporter and detrib­alised Nigerian.
