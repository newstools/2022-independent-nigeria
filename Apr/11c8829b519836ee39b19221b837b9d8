Ahmed Musa; Kingsley Benneth Abuja – The National Assembly on Thursday approved a revised budget of N17,319,704,091,019 for the 2022 fiscal year. It also increased the budget deficit by N965.42 billion to N7.35 trillion and increased fuel subsidy for 2022 budget by N3.557 trillion, from N442.72 billion to N4 trillion. The National Assembly, in December, 2021, passed a budget of N17,126,873,917,692 trillion. The approval came with the passage of a bill to amend the 2022 Appropriations Act transmitted to the National Assembly on February 10, 2022, by President Muhammadu Buhari for consideration. The revised sum of N17.3 trillion, in contrast with the 2022 budget of 17.13 trillion passed last year, represents a N193 billion increase. The passage of the Appropriations Act, 2022 (Amendment) Bill, Thursday, followed the consideration of a report by the Appropriations Committees of the two chambers. Out of the total sum of N17,319,704,091,019 passed, N817,699,410,210 is for Statutory Transfers; N3,978,087,110,437 for Debt Service; N7,108,621,131,849 for Recurrent (Non- Debt Expenditure); and N5,415,296,438,523 for Contribution to the Development Fund for Capital Expenditure. POLL Also, the National Assembly approved the total sum of N3.55 trillion for PMS subsidy in 2022, forwarded in two separate requests by the president to it for approval. The president, in a letter to the legislature dated February 10, 2022, sought an additional N2.557 trillion to fund subsidy payments from July to December, 2022. He disclosed that 138 of the 254 projects in the budget totalling N13.24 billion had been identified for deletion. The National Assembly in December, 2021, had approved the sum of N442.7 billion for subsidy in the 2022 budget for the period of January to June this year. Buhari, however, anchored his fresh request on the fact that PMS subsidy was not duly appropriated for in the national budget beyond June. According to him, the development was as a result of the provisions of the Petroleum Industry Act which stops all such payments past the given June deadline. In another letter dated April 12, 2022, President Buhari requested the National Assembly to approve an additional N1 trillion to his earlier N2.557 subsidy request to bring the total amount on payments to N4 trillion for the year 2022. He explained that the additional request was against the backdrop of adjustments to the 2022 fiscal framework which became imperative due to market developments occasioned by the spike in crude prices, following the Russian-Ukrainian war. The chambers, accordingly, approved the president’s request for additional N3.557 trillion for PMS subsidy with the passage of the 2022 Appropriations Act (Amendment) Bill, Thursday. The National Assembly also approved N192.52 billion aggregate increase sought by the executive, and an additional provision of N182.45 billion to cater for the salary of the Nigeria Police Force to enhance their morale. On Buhari’s request for adjustments to the 2022 fiscal framework, the approval at the upper chamber followed the consideration of a report by the Senate Committee on Finance. The report was laid by the Chairman of the Committee, Senator Olamilekan Adeola. Accordingly, the Senate approved $73 per barrel as proposed by President Buhari. It also approved oil production volume of 1.600 million per day, and a cut in the provision for federally funded upstream projects being implemented by N200 billion from N352.80. It approved an increase in the Federal Government independent revenue of N400 billion. It also okayed debt service provision of N76.13 billion, and net reductions in statutory transfers by N66.07 billion. A breakdown of the net reductions are as follows: NDDC, by N13.46 billion from N102.78 billion to N89.32 billion; NEDC, by N6.30 billion from N48.08 billion to N41.78 billion; and UBEC, by N23.16 billion from N112.29 billion to N89.13 billion. Others are Basic Health Care Fund, by N11.58 billion from N56.14 billion to N44.56 billion; and NASENI, by N11.58 billion from N56.14 billion to N44.56 billion. The chamber also approved the fiscal deficit of N7.35 trillion. Adeola, in his presentation, said that the total budget deficit is projected to increase by N965.42 billion to N7.35 trillion, representing 3.99% of Gross Domestic Product (GDP). He disclosed that, “the incremental deficit will be financed by new borrowings from the domestic market.” Lawmakers, who took turns to make contributions during consideration of the report on the review of the 2022 fiscal framework, blamed the country’s economic downturn on crude oil theft. As the House of Representatives approved N4 trillion subsidy, statutory transfers received some cuts in the newly revised fiscal framework. Presenting the seven- point recommendations by the House Committee on Finance, the Chairman, James Abiodun Faleke, also urged the House to approve a cut in the provision for federally funded upstream projects being implemented by N200 billion from N352.80 billion. He also called for an approval of additional provision of N182.45 billion to cater for the salary of the Nigeria Police Force. Faleke said: “That the House do consider the report of the Committee on Finance on the request by the president for revision of the 2022 fiscal framework and approve the recommendations therein. “That the oil price benchmark of $73 per barrel be approved. “That oil production volume of 1.600 million per day be approved. “That premium motor spirit (PMS) subsidy of N4.00 trillion be approved. “That a cut in the provision for federally funded upstream projects being implemented by N200 billion from N352.80 billion be approved. “That an increase in the projection for Federal Government independent revenue by N400 billion be approved. “That an additional provision of N182.45 billion to cater for the needs of the Nigeria Police Force be approved. “That domestic debt service provision of N76.13 billion, and net reductions in statutory transfers by N66.07 billion, as follows”. On the part of statutory transfers, some agencies were affected by the reduction in the amount hitherto provided for in the 2022 budget. He said: “That Niger Delta Development Commission (NDDC) budget be reduced by N13.46 billion from N102.78 billion to N89.32 billion. “That North East Development Commission (NEDC), by N6.30 billion from N48.08 billion to N41.78 billion. “That Universal Basic Education (UBEC), by N23.16 billion from N112.29 billion to N89.13 billion. “That the Basic Health Care Fund, by N11.58 billion from N56.14 billion to N44.56 billion; and that NASENI, by N11.58 billion from N56.14 billion to N44.56 billion. “That the fiscal deficit of N7.35 trillion be approved”. Considering the report at the Committee of Supply, the Deputy Speaker, Ahmed Idris Wase, who presided over the session put question on all clauses which members voted unanimously. Briefing journalists on the amendments, the House Appropriation Committee Chairman, Muktar Aliyu Betara, said the new request sought by the president has now increased the budget figure, introduced subsidy figure and increased the deficit. According to him, it is incumbent on the House to consider the reasons adduced by the president and approve same in the interest of the country based on current global realities. He, however, advised that efforts must be made to reduce the amount spent on subsidy as such could have been used to improve the welfare of civil servants by way of salary increase.
