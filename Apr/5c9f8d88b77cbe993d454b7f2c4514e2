Founder of the Dunamis International Gospel Center, Paul Enenche, has stated that divorce is not allowed under any condition but it is better to leave an abusive marriage alive than to die in one. Enenche disclosed this while reacting to the death of gospel music musician, Osinachi Nwachukwu, who allegedly died in hands of her abusive partner. Recall that the singer was announced dead on Friday, after being on life support for the past two months. The cleric said, “My counsel to anybody, if you don’t love somebody’s daughter, instead of killing them, hand them back to their father. “Divorce is not allowed under any condition, but this is what I believe, it is better to be alive and there is no marriage than for you to die because of marriage. “A killer marriage is a nonsense marriage and I am not talking about physical killing, there are people who can finish their husband or wife emotionally, psychologically, and mentally. This woman is a shadow of her life.”
