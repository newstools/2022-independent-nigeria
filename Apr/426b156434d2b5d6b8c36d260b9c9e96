Lagos – Super Falcons of Nigeria are confident of a better outing against Olympic Champions Canada in the second of their two-match bouquet on Tuesday morning in Nigeria. Two-second half goals by Jessie Fleming (50th minute) and Vanessa Gilles (72nd minute) earned the world’s sixth –ranked team victory over the African champions in their first encounter in Vancouver on Friday. However, Coach Randy Waldrum prosecuted that game with only 14 players, most of whom arrived on the eve of the match due to late issuance of visa from their respective bases. They held on tenaciously in the first 45 minutes but fatigue and injuries saw goalkeeper Chiamaka Nnadozie, defender and skipper Onome Ebi and forward Uchenna Kanu stretchered off at different times during the game. Midfielder Rita Chikwelu also had to be substituted. However, Nigeria would be able to offer greater tenacity in this duel as injured players would have recovered, there would have been more training sessions for greater bonding and understanding, and there is the added impetus offered by the arrival of barnstorming forward Francisca Ordega in Canada on Sunday. Tuesday’s encounter will take place at the Starlight Stadium.
