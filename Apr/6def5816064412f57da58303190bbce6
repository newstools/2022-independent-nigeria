Warri – Dr. Bukola Saraki, former President of the Senate, said all Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) presidential hopefuls from the North were working for a consensus candidate to foster desired unity in the country. Saraki disclosed this in Asaba on Monday when he led other aspirants, including Governor Aminu Tambuwal of Sokoto State, Bala Mohammed of Bauchi State and former Managing Director of FSB International Bank Plc, Alhaji Mohammad Hayatu-Deen, on a consultative visit to Governor Ifeanyi Okowa at Government House, Asaba. He said that Nigeria was in dire need of competent leaders to reverse the country’s slide into poverty, insecurity and anarchy. He stated that Nigeria was the largest economy in Africa under the PDP, but regretted that the country was now the poverty and kidnapping capital of the world under the All Progressives Congress (APC)-led Federal Government. He called on stakeholders of the party to support consensus arrangements to ensure that the party remained united and able to rescue the country from maladministration. According to Saraki, we are here, the four of us, to discuss with Governor Ifeanyi Okowa on how to build consensus for our party ahead of the presidential election. “We had a very useful discussion with the governor; we have decided to come as four of us who are aspiring to be president on the PDP platform. “Your Excellency, you know your reputation for the PDP and the country is always first in your mind and ever since, when there is assignment that has to do with ensuring unity of the party you have always been called upon.”
