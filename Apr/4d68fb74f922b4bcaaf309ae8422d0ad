LAGOS – A popular support group of the ruling party, the All Progressives Congress (APC) Professionals Council, has called on all members of the party and supporters of the various aspirants seeking to contest the 2023 general election to desist from name-calling and haul of abusive language. The Director General of APC Professionals Council, Seyi Bamigbade, gave this advice when receiving defected members of the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) in Zamfara State on Monday. Bamigbade, in a statement made available to Daily Independent in Lagos, said the era of personal attacks in politics is gone, urging the aspirants to educate their supporters on the need to play issue-based politics rather than resorting to mudslinging. He said the entrenched practice of members attacking one another in the same political family would send the wrong signal to the opposition, stating that it breeds enmity, which may affect the party in the upcoming elections. According to him, those who seek to display their loyalty to their principals by attacking the personality of fellow contestants are not doing their principals any good, urging them to desist from such practice. Calling for decorum, decency, civility and respect for one another amongst party members, Bamigbade said such virtues would help the party to remain united even after the 2023 general elections.
