POLL As to their concerns, NLC in its Communique on the meeting rued the intermittent and protracted strikes and other industrial actions in Nigeria’s public tertiary education system. Also lamented on by the union is the non-implementation of collective bargaining agreements signed with unions in Nigeria’s tertiary education system which touch on university funding, earned allowances, and other welfare issues facing universities staff; and the fate of more than 95% of Nigerian students largely constituted by children of the poor who cannot afford to pay the average of one million naira school fees charged by private tertiary institutions and who are currently idling away at home while the children of the rich continue with their education.
