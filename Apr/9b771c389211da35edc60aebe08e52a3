LAGOS – Senate President, Ahmad Lawan may join the growing list of presidential aspirants who are seeking to contest on the platform of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC). An associate of Lawan informed DAILY INDEPENDENT that the Number Three Citizen, who may not retain his position as Senate President in the next political dispensation, may declare interest in the race if the APC decides to throw the presidential ticket open. While there are strong indications that the APC might zone the ticket to the South since the National Chairman is from the North, some stakeholders in the party are pushing for an open contest where all the aspirants will participate. Leading the move for the ticket to be thrown open is Kogi state governor, Yahaya Bello who is also seeking to become the party’s presidential flagbearer. If Lawan declares, he will be joining the growing list of aspirants which include the current Vice-President, Prof. Yemi Osinbajo (SAN); Asiwaju Bola Tinubu; Governor Dave Umahi of Ebonyi State and his Kogi State counterpart, Yahaya Bello. Others are Rotimi Amaechi, Minister of Transportation, Kayode Fayemi, Ekiti State Governor, Rochas Okorocha, former Imo state governor and Orji Uzor Kalu, former Abia State Governor. Godwin Emefiele, the governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) and Senator Ibikunle Amosun, former Ogun state governor are also rumoured to be interested in running on the platform of the APC but they are yet to open up on whether they will also join the race or not.
