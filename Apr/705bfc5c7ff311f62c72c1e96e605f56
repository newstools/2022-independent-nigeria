Ifeanyi Ejiofor, lawyer to the Indigenous People of Biafra, IPOB’s leader Nnamdi Kanu has accused the Department of State Services, DSS, of starving the Kanu. According to Ejiofor, DSS has not allowed Kanu to eat more than once a day. Ejiofor lamented that the IPOB’s leader was getting worse due to the refusal of the DSS, to allow him to change his clothes despite repeated court orders to do so.Ejiofor said, “We were also reliably informed by Onyendu that his meals are no longer served regularly. Onyendu barely eats once a day, and this situation is not helping his deteriorating medical condition. “The lawless DSS personnel have remained adamant with how they treat Court orders with levity and disdain, which is unacceptable as no one is above the law anywhere in the world. “Be assured UmuChineke that we, in the legal team are not resting on our oars towards ensuring that these infractions are addressed with immediate effect.”
