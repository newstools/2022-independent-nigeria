FIFA announced on Thursday that Vancouver has become a candidate host city for the 2026 FIFA World Cup to be held in Canada, United States, and Mexico. “We could not be prouder to support Vancouver as a candidate host city for the 2026 FIFA World Cup,” said Axel Schuster, Whitecaps FC chief executive officer. “We are excited to work with our partners at the City of Vancouver and BC Place Stadium, and help bring the world’s greatest sporting event to our home city and stadium.” Following the submission of documentation by the Province of British Columbia/City of Vancouver in order to join the candidate host city process (with BC Place as the proposed stadium), as well as a recent inspection visit by a FIFA delegation, world football’s governing body has agreed to accept the city’s candidacy. Vancouver is not new to FIFA events, having successfully hosted several matches during the FIFA Women’s World Cup Canada 2015™, including the final in front of over 50,000 spectators.
