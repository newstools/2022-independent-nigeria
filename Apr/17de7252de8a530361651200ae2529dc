Ifedayo Akindoju, Pres­ident of Nigeria Tennis Federation (NTF), Ifedayo Akindoju, has reiterated the needs for stakehold­ers to focus on grassroots sporting events to harness young talents for sustain­able sports development in the country. Akindoju made the call recently in Abuja during the Annual General Meet­ing (AGM) of Abuja Coun­try Club, where he was elected the new president. “We have lots of young talents all over the coun­try and we need to harness them for proper develop­ment of their skills and sports in Nigeria,” he said. Akindoji also called for intensified surveillance and intelligence gather­ing by the relevant secu­rity agencies to protect lives and property in the country. The Out-gone President, Sir Alex Osakwe, who had been the president for over four years, described his experience as pleasurable. ”I am excited that we have a good team that is taking over from me and I know that they will build on the legacy we are leav­ing behind,” he said. The club’s Board of Trustees Chairman, His Royal Highness Eze Ik­wunna Ukwu, said the ex­ecutive members had been doing a lot and urged them to do more for the benefit of members, FCT and the country.
