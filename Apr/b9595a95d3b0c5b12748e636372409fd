Coach Ibrahim Musa of Kano Pillars is uncertain on the abilities and mentality of the Sai Masu Gida to remain in the Nigerian topflight unless something drastic is done to the former Nigerian champions. A player of the team, who is very close to the coach, disclosed to SATURDAY INDEPENDENT that the coach who walked into the former CAF Champions League campaigners full of confidence to do well, is now unsure of the status of the club at the end of the season, with 15 matches to go. “The coach is worried because our position on the log does not reflect what we can do. “It is not about him but about those who should show enough support to the team. “He has severally made appeals to the state government to come to the rescue of the club but it seems all these are fallen on the ground without result. “If this continues, this club may not survive relegation and this is the fear of the coach who has given everything to arrest the situation but you ask yourself one question. Will be able to play in an empty stomach? “This is the condition of the players here and so there is no motivation to carry on,” said the player. Recall that sometimes ago in the ongoing season, the players of the club threatened to down-tool over unpaid entitlements but were prevented when higher powers intervened. POLL The Sai Masu Gida are presently in the relegation zone on 17th spot with 26 points from 24 matches. Later today, they will be away to Niger Tornadoes in a game they have to win to help their fight against the drop.
