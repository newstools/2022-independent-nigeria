Manchester City will trigger the £50million release clause of former Newcastle United midfielder Mikel Merino, according to El Confidencial. The Spaniard came to Tyneside from Borussia Dortmund in 2017 – initially on loan – before penning a five-year deal just three moves after his arrival. However, the youngster grew homesick and was allowed to leave for Real Sociedad the following season. At his unveiling, Merino said: “I am very happy to play in a club that I love and one that I have followed since I was a child. The fans here have spoken so well to me and being back to being close to home is important.” Newcastle recouped around £10million for the midfielder but his stint at St James’ Park was a missed opportunity due to the player he has become. Now 25-years-old, Merino has blossomed into one of the brightest talents in La Liga and is part of the Spain setup. Latest reports suggest Pep Guardiola is keen to bring his compatriot to the Etihad at the end of the season. Sociedad would command a sizable transfer fee as Merino – who has a similar playing style to Guardiola – is contracted until 2025. City could stump up the £50million to activate the player’s release clause and lure him back to the Premier League.
