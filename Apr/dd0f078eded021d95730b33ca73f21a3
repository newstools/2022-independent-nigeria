Manchester United legend Sir Alex Ferguson has given his verdict on the appointment of Erik ten Hag. The Dutchman will become the next permanent boss at Old Trafford at the end of the season. United have endured a dismal campaign and look set to miss out on Champions League qualification, sitting six points off fourth spot with four games remaining. United haven’t claimed a league title since Ferguson’s final season in charge. Ten Hag will become the fifth permanent manager to occupy the Old Trafford dugout since Ferguson’s 2013 departure. The legendary Scot was asked for his opinion on Ten Hag’s appointment while attending a race meeting at Punchestown. He told RTE Racing: “Well, I hope he ( Ten Hag ) does well because the club needs someone to get in control. I hope he does well, yeah.” Ralf Rangnick will step down from his role as interim manager at the end of the season before taking up a consultancy role. The German tactician recently suggested as many as 10 new signings may need to be made at Old Trafford this summer as Ten Hag prepares for a major rebuild.
