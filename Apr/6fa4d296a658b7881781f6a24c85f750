Despite their almost being there,Stanley Eguma has said Rivers United were far from sealing the 2021/2022 Nigeria Professional Football League (NPFL) season. That could be true after the former league champions were piped 1-0 by Sunshine Stars on Thursday. But earlier, the 2019 cham­pions Enyimba were guests of the champions-in-waiting at their fortress, the Adokiye Amiesimaka Stadium, Port Harcourt in a MatchDay 23 game moved by 24 hours after their lengthy trip back from Katsina. Rivers United were aiming for a rare league double over the People’s Elephant and they got their noses in front in the 21st minute when Ish­aq Rafiu converted from the penalty spot after he had been upended by Enyimba captain Austin Oladapo. The Pride of Rivers dou­bled their advantage in the 34th minute through Chia­maka Madu who bundled the ball home from close range after a moment of defensive uncertainty for the visitors. Enyimba tried to claw their ways back into the game but were prevented from doing so by a resolute Rivers United side who had an answer for every question asked by the former league champions. Monday’s win takes Rivers United’s ponts tally for the sea­son to a staggering 52 points from 23 matches, four clear of second place Plateau Unit­ed who have 48 points from the same number of games. But on Thursday, they were expected to consolidate but they capitulated against Sun­shine Stars who were making a return to their Akure home after a long sojourn outside. Eguma, a league winner in 2011, says in spite of their imperial run, nothing is guar­anteed yet.
