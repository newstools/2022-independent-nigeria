Peter Amuchie (Sky P), CEO & Creative Director, Drop Off Fashion, has disclosed the reason why he returned to Nigeria to set up his clothing brand in Lekki Phase 1, Lagos, in 2021. In a chat, the fashion designer said that top world fashion houses have not considered West Africa as a potential market to sell their brands due to economic uncertainties, under-development and high business risks. Being an African who believes in the saying that North, South, East and West, the home remains the best, he had to take the bold step to change the narrative, even though he started his fashion career in the United States before setting up factories in Dubai, Vietnam, Bangladesh, Italy and China. He returned home to set up his luxury brand in his home country Nigeria. He has also hailed Nigerians and Africans in general for embracing his creative ideas and rocking his brand with pride and has boasted that he maintains high-quality luxury in clothing just like Gucci, LV, Fendi and others.In his words: “My brands are high end and I am looking forward to attracting the perfect exposure needed, then the world will be wowed at what I can offer the fashion industry. DropOff Fashion is located at 28B Adebayo Doherty Road, 14, Lekki Phase 1, Lagos Nigeria. Instagram: dropoff_fashion and his personal IG handle is @legendaryskyp
