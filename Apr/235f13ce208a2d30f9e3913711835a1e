Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky on Saturday criticized a decision by UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres to visit Moscow on Tuesday, before heading to Kyiv. “It is simply wrong to go first to Russia and then to Ukraine,” Zelenskyy told reporters in the Ukrainian capital. “There is no justice and no logic in this order,” he added. The UN has been largely marginalized in the crisis since Russian leader Vladimir Putin sent troops to Ukraine on February 24. Guterres seeks to spur dialogue to end the conflict, the UN said on Wednesday.
