Lagos – Dimeji Lawal, former Super Eagles star, has challenged the handlers of the Nigerian national team to look the way of the Nigeria Professional Football League (NPFL) to plug some holes in the team, particularly the goalkeeping department. The former youth international said given that the Nigerian topflight had improved, the Super Eagles handlers should regularly visit it to scout for players, who would give their best. “Our league has improved and I think the coach can see one or two players that will be considered. “Even this goalkeeping issues we have can be sorted out from the league. So I want whoever that will be the new coach to be very much interested in the NPFL. “In that way, even if he does not see any player to take, he can make suggestions on ways to further develop the league,” said the diminutive player of the Saudi ‘89 fame. Recall that so many Nigerians blamed goalkeeper Maduka Okoye for Nigeria’s ouster from the 2022 Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) in Cameroon where the goalie allowed a cheap shot from Tunisia to get better of him at the round of 16 match. Nigerians also came down hard on Francis Uzoho for the country’s failure to qualify for 2022 World Cup after a direct shot from Arsenal’s Thomas Partey was poorly handled by the goalie leading to the 1-1 score line recorded in the second leg of the playoff, on the basis of which Ghana usurped Nigeria to qualify for the Mundial.
