Olori Badirat Olaitan Adeyemi, an estranged wife of the late Alaafin of Oyo, has mourned the monarch, describing their relationship as that of a ‘Siamese’, despite being married to him at the young age of 19. Queen Ola as she is popularly called disclosed this via her official Instagram post on Monday, wishing she could still have a moment to talk to the late king. She wrote, “I was thinking it’s all lies and that you are coming back but I’m afraid I was wrong. “The father of my kids, whom I met at an impressionable age, left when it was least expected. Whenever I tell people that the bond we share can be likened to that of a ‘Siamese’, having been married to you at age 19, they are more than transfixed. “We were practically best of friends but the moment they had an inkling about whom your favourite was, everything flopped. “Alas! the kids and I can’t see you anymore nor converse with you any longer but I vehemently believe you are seeing us, how I wish we can still have few words because I’ve got a whole lot to tell you. “I’m bereft of what to tell the boys especially, Adejuwon, because, at his age, he reads and surfs the net so much that curiosity gets hold of him and has already known a lot about you. “You remain to me, the best father, teacher and mentor and husband that ever bestrode the landscapes. Almighty Allah will forgive all your sins and accept your return.”
