Turkey has lifted visa requirement for Polish tourists and transit passengers in a move designed to boost its war-hit tourism industry. The visa exemption will allow Poles to visit Turkey for 90 days in every 180 days, according to a presidential decree published in the Official Gazette on Tuesday. The war in Ukraine is threatening Turkey’s tourism industry – Russian and Ukrainian tourists totalled more than a quarter of all visitors last year. Turkey is seeking to boost revenue from tourism to help steady the lira, which lost 44 percent of its value in 2021, spur economic growth and finance its current account deficit. Before the war erupted, the Turkish government had predicted that tourism revenue this year could equal or exceed the record $35 billion the country earned in 2019.
