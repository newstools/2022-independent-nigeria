Enugu – It was another tragic Monday in Enugu following an attack launched by hoodlums at Holy Ghost Motor Park which left two people dead. They were said to be enforcing the Monday sit-at-home order. It was also learnt that the hoodlums burnt a Sienna bus during the attack in Enugu. An eyewitness told our correspondent that the hoodlums who were masked came in a mini-bus. He said, “We were at the park waiting for early morning passengers when the gunmen arrived in a mini-bus. “Immediately I saw them, I knew their mission was evil so I quickly left the park and by the time I looked back I saw one of the Sienna buses in flames as gunshots rented the air. We later learnt that two of the passengers were shot dead.” When contacted, Enugu Police Public Relations Officer, Daniel Ndukwe (ASP), did not reply to the message sent to him to confirm the incident. In a related development, a car was smashed by a tipper truck at Nza Street, Independence Layout in Enugu metropolis on Monday morning. POLL An eyewitness said that the road which was deserted as a result of the sit-at-home order couldn’t still contain the reckless lorry driver who was said to be on a high speed and consequently smashed the car. The accident left the car badly damaged while the tipper truck ended up falling on its side but no life was lost as people were not on the street due to the sit-at-home order.
