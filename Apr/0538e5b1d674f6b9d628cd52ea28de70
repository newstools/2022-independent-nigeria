MINNA – The Governor of Rivers State, Nyesom Wike, has for the second time in one month visited Niger State, this time to interact with and solicit for the support of Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) delegates ahead of the party’s 28 and 29 May, 2022 national convention. Wike, accompanied by three other PDP governors from the southern part of the country – Seyi Makinde of Oyo State, Okezie Ikpeazu of Abia State, and their Enugu State counterpart, Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi – met with former Military Presidents General Ibrahim Badamasi Bababngida (IBB) and General Abdulsalami Abubarkar, over the state of the nation. Wike, who is one of the Aso Rock contenders for 2023, however, did not visit the PDP family in Niger State, nor was the party chairman, Tanko Beji, available during the visit, thereby fuelling speculations of possible no-love-lost between him and the party in the state. But yesterday, at the PDP secretariat, at Eastern By-pass, Minna, Governor Wike promised that he would be a president that will speak for and protect the collective interest of all Nigerians irrespective of tribal, religious, regional and political affiliations, if given the mandate. Nyesom Wike said the only project the President Muhammadu Buhari led administration bequeathed to Nigerians included heightened insecurity, particularly that of the Fulani militia and armed bandits whose activities have sent many Nigerians to their early graves. “It is unfortunate that while many homes suffer hunger, deprivation and insecurity, the APC administration looks the other way,” he said.
