As the Nigerian political climate continues to gather storm with a wave of declarations for the seat of the President of the Republic, it appears Nollywood actress, Jemima Osunde is ready to throw in her hat. In a Twitter post, the actress uploaded a photo of herself which she caption ‘Jemima For President’. She went ahead to humorously list out reasons why she should be regarded as a viable candidate. Among the reasons listed by Jemima, who is also a medical professional, are that she was class captain many times in primary school, was deputy head girl in junior secondary school, was a social prefect in senior secondary school, was president of the literary and debating club, can play chess, was president of JETS club too. She also notes that her House in secondary school won inter house sports a lot although she states that that particular piece of information is not confirmed. Revealing some of the actions she intends to take as president, Jemima notes; “Personally, I don’t believe one person can fix all the problems in this country so when I’m president, I will face these NEPA people. I will start by sacking all the people working there right now. I don’t know who I’ll replace them with yet but it’s quite clear to all of us that the people there need to be soaked inside rice. “After that, I will ask you people for which one is paining you “pass” & take it up. A vote for me is a vote for light. That’s why I used this bright and yellow picture. This is my mandate.”
