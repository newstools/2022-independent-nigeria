The fans of Ayodeji Ibrahim Balogun also known as Wizkid have come hard on Angelique Kidjo after the Nigerian Afrobeats’ album Made in Lagos, which was nominated for Best Global Music Album, lost to Angelique Kidjo’s Mother Nature at the 2022 Grammy Awards. His army of fans, also known as Wizkid Fc, had taken to Kidjo’s social media page to vent their anger. De.fame_luxury_autos_ wrote, “How many entries did your song have last year?

You set” POLL “You should let younger ones also make history, what did you even sing, I didn’t hear it on the radio, I didn’t hear it anywhere. Wizkid’s song is all over the world and he got nothing for it,” @leehoonstro5353 added.
