As the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) primary election is just a month away, the PDP New Generation has called on the Iyorchia Ayu-led National Working Committee (NWC) of the party to guide against the imposition of candidates and godfatherism. The PDP group made the call while addressing newsmen during the launch of Operation Rescue Nigeria in Abuja. The group Director-General, Audu Mahmood while speaking at the launch said that what Nigerians need at this crucial time is to recreate hope and make the country safe and united again after the seven years of maladministration under the All Progressives Congress (APC). Mahmood also called on the APC governors and all the members of the Federal Executive Council of President Muhammadu Buhari’s administration not to contest any elective position in 2023. He said, “In as much as we appreciate the NWC led by Sen. Iyorchia Ayu for its efforts in fostering unity amongst party members which will ultimately put the party back to its winning ways. “As the party primaries draw closer, we call on the NWC to ensure that aspirants are not imposed on a godfatherism basis. “The primaries should be conducted with a credible election that will produce the best flag bearers at all levels. “Our nation stands on the perimeter of crisis. An astounding calamity beckons. But this current misfit of leadership can avert disaster if they manage the remaining of our fragile union. POLL “The failed leadership and governance at hand cuts across every elected or appointed member of this government. “Therefore, we ask that all members of the Federal Executive Council (FEC) and Governors of the APC who do not have solutions to the current calamities insight and the aberration in place to honourably and with a bit of shame refute their plans of planning to return or seek electoral power to continue or complete the damage they started.”
