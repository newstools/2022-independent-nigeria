ABUJA – Senator George Akume minister of Special Duties and Intergovernmental Affairs has assured the new All Progressives Congress (APC) National Working Committee (NWC) leadership under Abdullahi Adamu of his support to succeed in the onerous tasks before it. Senator Akume who led a large group of Benue State APC leaders on a solidarity visit to the new APC administration said he ran for the Chairman of the party convinced that he would add value but willingly joined others to accept the Consensus option that threw up the present leadership of the party. He also said that he has willingly donated his nomination fee which was to be refunded in the spirit of the Consensus arrangement,.to the party, and expressed hope that his other colleague aspirants will do the same as part of their support to the new APC leadership. Drawing comparison with the style of leadership of President Mohammadu Buhari and former President Olusegun Obasanjo he said the decision to build Consensus that threw up Senator Adamu was not a directive, describing Buhari as a thorough democrat “It was not a directive and you know who the President is; a Democrat to the core. I know and I recall what happened in the past when I was the governor; there was a world of difference between the way Mr President operates and the way we saw between 1999 and 2007. “The issue on money does not arise as well. I had willingly donated my own to the party and I believe others would do the same thing. We have this basic understanding, we have to support the present leadership of the party to succeed; that is what is important so that we will continue with the good work that Mr President is doing”. On the crisis rocking the party in Benue State, Senator said that the problem will soon be resolved, assuring “the National Chairman that the little irritation in Benue state are going to be squarely addressed for the benefit of our party and for the benefit of our teaming supporters who look onto the APC as the only hope of the common man in Benue state and even at the national level”.
