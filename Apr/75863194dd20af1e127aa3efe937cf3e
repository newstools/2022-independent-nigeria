ABUJA – Justice Taiwo Taiwo of the Federal High Court Abuja, on Thursday, refused to declare illegal and unconstitutional, the defection of Governor Ben Ayade of Cross Rivers State and his Deputy, Professor Ivara Ejemot Esu. Justice Taiwo declined to declare Ayade’s seat vacant while delivering judgment on a suit filed by the Peoples Democratic Party against the Governor and his deputy over their defection to the All Progressives Congress (APC). By the suit, the PDP had sought an order of the court for the governor and his deputy to vacate office having defected to the APC. On Wednesday, the presiding judge ordered lead counsel to address the court in view of the recent decision of Enugu Division of the Court of Appeal, which held that Governor David Umahi and his deputy did not offend any known law due to their defection from the PDP to the APC but only did so in exercise of their constitutional rights to freedom of association as enshrined under section 40 of the 1999 Constitution. PDP predicated its suit on the fact that Senator Ayade and his deputy, presently members of the APC, did not win the March 9, 2019 Governorship election in Cross River state. The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), APC and the Deputy Governor, Prof. Ejemot Esu were joined as defendants in the suit, which was filed in October 2021. Ayade was elected under the platform of the PDP in 2015 and 2019, but decamped to the APC on May 20, 2021, along with his deputy, Prof. Esu. Specifically, the PDP had contended that the mandate given by the electorate in Cross River state was to it as a party, arguing that Ayade as its candidate at the election cannot transfer the mandate to the APC or any other political party.
