Oghara community in Ethiope West Local Government Area of Delta State has petitioned Governor Ifeanyi Okowa to urgently call neighbouring Itsekiris to order to avoid a seemingly bloody situation between the two ethnic groups in the area over land dispute. In the petition also forwarded to the Vice-President, Yemi Osibanjo, Army Headquarters, Abuja, the Navy hierarchy and other top government agencies, the embittered Oghara people decried the illegal and unlawful handing over of vast expanse of land located at Otegbo, which Itsekiri renamed Obitugbo and handed over to the Nigerian Army by His Majesty, Ogiame Atuwatse III, the Olu of Warri. The people in the petition, signed by Secretary of Oghara traditional council, Chief Frank Emiko, said they can no longer tolerate the attitude of the Itsekiris, who have refused to heed to warnings that the land in dispute belongs to the Oghara. “We had earlier in one of our numerous letters, revealed the plan by Itsekiris in the area to establish a private university in Oghara land. “
