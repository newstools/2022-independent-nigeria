Yahaya Bello’s comment is coming barely 24 hours after expressing optimism that he was most favoured to clinch the party’s ticket for the Presidency. Speaking during his second annual seminar for political and crime correspondents in Abuja, Governor Bello reckoned that although Tinubu and other eminent personalities were founding members of the party, But, however, said that the foundation of a house was not enough, as there were other things to be put in place to build a house. Asked if he was scared of contending with top presidential aspirants in the APC, Bello boldly declared, “I will say No! I am not scared of anybody in the contest for the APC presidential ticket”. “Tinubu and others are founding members of the APC, but the foundation is not enough. I will defeat all the other aspirants because I have all it takes to be a champion. “My performance in Kogi State will speak for me,” Bello affirmed. According to him, there are over 16 million Nigerians with Permanent Voters Cards already waiting to vote for him in the 2023 election.
