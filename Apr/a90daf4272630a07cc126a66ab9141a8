UGHELLI – Niger Delta Activist and Ex-militant Leader, Alhaji Awo Harmony, under the aegis of the Ogbia Justice Freedom Movement has criticized Senator Degi Eremieyon Biobarakuma for seeking re-election to the Senate after his multiple names and certificate forgery scandal that denied the All Progressives Congress (APC) the opportunity of governing Bayelsa State. This is contained in a statement signed by Harmony said that Senator Degi Eremieyon Biobarakuma was the Deputy Governor-elect while Mr David Lyon was Governor-elect of Bayelsa State and was already preparing for swearing-in when the Supreme Court ordered the Independent National Electoral Commission INEC in a landmark judgement to withdraw the certificate of return issued to the duo following the discovery of forged certificates and multiple names by Senator Degi Eremieyon Biobarakuma and should be given to the PDP governorship candidate, Senator Douye Diri and his Deputy. He noted that Senator Biobarakuma ought to hide his face in shame rather than nurse a futile ambition of returning to the Senate to represent Bayelsa East after he brought global shame and ridicule to Bayelsa State and the All Progressives Congress as well as the good people of Bayelsa State who voted en masse for Mr David Lyon of the APC. “It is shameful that Senator Degi Eremieyon Biobarakuma who presently represents Bayelsa East in the Senate is thinking of seeking reelection, a man whose constituents don’t even know his correct names more so, the zoning arrangements that had been in existence is totally against his selfish ambition “. “I want to warn the APC not to consider giving Senator Degi Biobarakuma the opportunity of returning to the senate after the political disaster he caused the party.” Alhaji Awo Harmony maintained that there will be a political and electoral backlash if the APC fields Senator Degi Eremieyon Biobarakuma as the candidate of the party for the forthcoming election as Ogbia youths will resist any attempt to foist Senator Biobarakuma on the people of Bayelsa East Senatorial District with the last drop of their blood. “We expect Senator Degi Eremieyon Biobarakuma to go and hide his face like the prodigal son and seek genuine forgiveness and not try to bend the wishes of the people by seeking re-election when there is a zoning arrangement that did no to favour his return to the National Assembly.”
