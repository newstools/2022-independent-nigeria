LAGOS – Benedict Anieze, a 29 years-old man, has been arrested for allegedly smashing his one month-old daughter’s head on the floor at Idimu area of Lagos State. The suspect was said to have allegedly committed the act after the quarrel he had with his wife a day before the incident. It was gathered that the suspect was drunk the day he committed the offence and he also tried to set himself ablaze, but he was stopped because of the scream for help from the mother of the baby that attracted neighbours in their compound which eventually led to his arrest. Anieze, the suspect who was paraded by the Police Public Relations Officer, SP Benjamin Hundeyin, before journalists on Thursday at the Command Headquarters, Ikeja, said the act was not intentional. He said he was in the bathroom when he heard a knock on his door and he rushed out to pick his baby, unfortunately the baby slipped from his hand and hit her head on the floor and died on the spot. “Immediately I saw what I did, I dashed out of my apartment and headed straight to where I kept my gallon of petrol with the purpose of setting myself ablaze. What happened was not intentional. I am not a ritualist. “I didn’t smash her head on the floor as claimed by the police. When the incident occurred I wasn’t myself anymore. I wanted to set myself ablaze, to die with the baby. I am not happy seeing the corpse of my daughter on the floor. What was coming to my mind was to kill myself. I did not have disagreement with my wife on the fateful day.”
