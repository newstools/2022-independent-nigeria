Lagos – Coach Issa Ladan Bosso of the Flying Eagles has said he would present a formidable team that won’t disappoint Nigerians when the WAFU U20 competition gets underway. The Flying Eagles were drawn against the Black Satellites in Group B and will also play their Burkinabe counterparts in the tournament to be held in Niamey, the capital of the West African country of Niger. The WAFU B U20 tournament will be staged in Niamey from May 7 to 20, 2022. While the teams will compete for the ultimate title, they will also be vying for places at the 2023 edition of the Total Energies U20 Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON). The top teams in the tournament will qualify for the competition to be held in Egypt from February 18, 2023 to March 12, 2023. The top four teams from the Egypt tournament will then qualify to play in the FIFA U20 World Cup which will be staged in Indonesia later in 2023. Speaking to DAILY INDEPENDENT on his preparedness to face his opponents, Bosso said there was no cause for alarm as he was preparing his players for the task ahead. “There is no issue but we are working hard to make sure we make Nigerians proud. I know we started late because our opponents have been in camp since but that won’t count for anything when the tournament starts. “Our plan is not only to qualify for the main tournament in Egypt but to win the cup. POLL I have been here before and I am in good position to understand how it is done so all we are asking Nigerians is to pray for us because on our own, we are gradually getting battle ready and by the time the tournament starts, we will be fully ready to face them,” he said.
