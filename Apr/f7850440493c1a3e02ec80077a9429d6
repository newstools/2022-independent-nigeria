Lagos – Kadiri Ikhana, the former Super Eagles defender, has charged the Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) and all relevant stakeholders to learn from the inability of the national team to qualify for the 2022 World Cup in Qatar. The former coach of the Super Falcons said it was still painful that the former African champions failed to qualify for the first FIFA World Cup in the Middle East, asserting that it was time that the football house learnt a huge experience from the failure. Ikhana, a former CAF Coach of the Year and a CAF Champions League winner with Enyimba, said Nigeria had the qualification on their hands and allowed it to slip off, warning that “unless we learn from that situation, it may happen again.” Ikhana said further: “It is still painful that we failed to qualify for the World Cup even when it was within our reach. “We know what it means to qualify for the World Cup and what it means to also miss it; it was very hard that time to believe that a team as experienced as the Super Eagles failed in that manner. “However, we should learn a hard lesson from the miss not to take things for granted. “They took the qualification for granted and we paid dearly for it. So it is time to learn some lessons because if we fail to learn some lessons, we give room for other failures. “I know now that some of the national teams are preparing for one competition or the other and this is the time to prepare them adequately,” the former defender said.
