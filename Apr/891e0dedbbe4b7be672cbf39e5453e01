Lagos – Eight times Nigeria Professional Football League (NPFL) winners, Enyimba International of Aba, may be suffering from lack of attention from the Abia State Government. This is the position of a member of the team who spoke to our correspondent on anonymity, saying the accusing fingers being pointed at Coach Finidi George amounted to looking for a fault where none exists. The source who is among the club’s management said the ‘People’s Elephants’ have not been taking care of unlike in the past, blaming the development to the fast approaching 2023 general election where the attentions of all the state governments are understandably focused on the election. “Finidi George is not the problem of our club; don’t mind what some people are saying about him,” the source alleged. “Was it not the same Finidi that got it right when he was employed and we even went unbeaten at a point in time? “What has changed now from his tactics? We should look beyond the coach because the attention of the government is not on the team right now. “Everyone working here will tell you where the fault is coming from; it is not about the coach or the players but about how they (the state government) have carried their own responsibility of taking care of the club. “Enyimba is lacking attention but not everything that is brought before the media,” he said. Meanwhile, this ongoing league season may end up being the first in a couple of years now that the former African champions failed to qualify for continental football as they are a distant ninth on the log with 35 points from 25 games, though with many games still left to be played.
