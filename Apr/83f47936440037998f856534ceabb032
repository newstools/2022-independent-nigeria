Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp has resisted temptation to make major changes for today’s derby against Everton. Despite the fixture list piling up, Liverpool have gone with a virtually full-strength side today. Alisson starts in goal for the Reds and it’s the familiar partnership of Joel Matip and Virgil van Dijk at centre back. Trent Alexander-Arnold and Andrew Robertson are the full backs with Fabinho in front of the back four. POLL Thiago and Naby Keita join Fabinho in midfield, with Mohamed Salah, Diogo Jota and Sadio Mane across the front three. That means Luis Diaz and Jordan Henderson drop to the bench, joining Caoimhin Kelleher, Joe Gomez, Ibrahima Konate, Kostas Tsimikas, James Milner, Curtis Jones and Divock Origi. Everton have Jordan Pickford in goal in front of a back four consisting of Seamus Coleman, Mason Holgate, Ben Godfrey and Vitaliy Mykolenko. Allan starts in midfield, joining Abdoulaye Doucoure and Alex Iwobi whilst Anthony Gordon and Demarai Gray will flank Richarlison up top. Teenager Isaac Price makes the bench for Everton today, joining Asmir Begovic, Jonjoe Kenny, Michael Keane, Fabian Delph, Jarrad Branthwaite, Salomon Rondon, Anwar El Ghazi and Dele Alli.
