Becoming a member of the South Africa black billionaires club has opened renewed interest in the background of Xolane Ndhlovu, the poor boy from Burgersfort, Riba Cross, Mpumalanga province. The 36-year-old billionaire entrepreneur and founder of DafriGroup PLC, a public company with a portfolio of interest in over 20 subsidiaries ranging from technology, banking, hospitality, real estate and blockchain among others is best known for his cryptocurrency and digital economy advocacy. With a reputation of a crypto and tech startup evangelist, it is not surprising that the bigger part of Ndhlovu’s R6 million wealth comes from his investment in Binance (BNB) and his sundry investments in tech-focused startups such as DafriBank, Bolt and Polkadot. According to the November 2021 Top 50 Crypto Rich list that announced his billionaire status, Xolane Ndhlovu’s net worth is in the region of $300 million. Aside from being the only black man on the list, Xolane Ndhlovu has written his name in gold in the African business “hall of fame” with the founding in 2021 of DafriBank Digital LTD, a one-of-a-kind financial technology company tailored towards serving the increasing needs of digital entrepreneurs for seamless and borderless payment platforms and options. Among others services, the bank’s structured finance and merchant API has won over millions of entrepreneurs working in the digital space across Africa. For someone who started life as a music DJ (known popularly as Master Ziggy) and later went to prison for a gang-related shooting, the chairman of the DafriBank Digital LTD had demonstrated business and financial savviness from the time he invested in Binance while in prison and after he founded the UMEH Group which he nurtured into a $100m company. By the time, he took over the DafriGroup PLC through a merger, Xolane Ndhlovu was ready to conquer the world. POLL Today, he sits atop a business empire that has over 20 subsidiaries including such household names as DafriBank Digital, DafriTechnologies, DafriXchange Africa, UMEH, and OMAHA Hotels.
