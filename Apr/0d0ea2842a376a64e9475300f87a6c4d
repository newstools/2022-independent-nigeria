Former President Bukola Saraki has called on the Delta State Chapter of the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) to support his presidential ambition in the 2023 general election in order to cleanse the nation of its toxicity. The Contact and Advocacy Council of Saraki made the call on Friday when they visited the PDP delegates in Asaba for the actualisation of Saraki’s presidential ambition come 2023. The leader of the Council, Prof (Sen) Iyorwuese Hagher, lamented the pervasive rot in Nigeria, saying that it was a direct manifestation of a failed government occasioned by the ineptitude of the President Muhammadu  Buhari-led All Progressives Congress (APC). Soliciting for support ahead of the PDP presidential primary, Hagher said, “As governor of Kwara State, he has a track record; as senate president, he has a track record; a record of doing the right thing. “As president of this country, Saraki has the political will to implement the much-needed change Nigeria desires. “The time has come for serious Nigerians to step forward to take charge of this country. We can no longer leave the affairs of this country to mediocre leadership.” Hagher expressed optimism that the leadership of Dr Bukola Saraki would be the right leadership for Nigeria, especially at this point in time when the country was confronted with numerous challenges. The Council noted that Nigeria had practically become toxic as a result of toxic leadership and appealed to the Delta State PDP delegates to support a Bukola Saraki presidency to cleanse the nation of its toxicity. POLL In his remark, the Chairman of the PDP in Delta State, Kingsley Esiso, said that he had no doubt that Saraki was well-equipped to make a good president. “He (Saraki) is a man of intelligence and capacity. As the chairman of our party’s reconciliatory committee, he has done very well to unite the party.” “I am assuring you that I will relate the message of the council to the leaders of the party and the governor of Delta State.”
