In the first half of a Monday night English Premiership League (EPL) fixture where Arsenal have not found their rhythm, Crystal Palace have taken a two-goal lead courtesy of a header by Jean-Philippe Mateta and a cool finish by Jordan Ayew. In the 16th minute, Joachim Andersen knocked Conor Gallagher’s free-kick onto the head of Mateta, who nodded it past Arsenal goalkeeper Aaron Ramsdale to put the home side into the lead against Arsenal, at Selhurst Park. Andersen was again the provider when he picked out Ayew with an incisive pass that left Gabriel and substitute Fullback Nuno Tavares stranded, leaving Ayew free to slot in a cool finish past Ramsdale to give Palace a 2-0 advantage against Arsenal. HALF TIME: Crystal Palace 2 – 0 Arsenal
