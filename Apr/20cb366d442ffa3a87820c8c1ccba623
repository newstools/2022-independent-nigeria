The National Chairman of the New Nigeria People’s Party ( NNPP ), Prof. Rufai Ahmed Alkali has empathised with the southwest leader of the party, Alhaji Adebisi AbdulRasheed Olopoeyan over the attack made on his residence in Ibadan, Oyo State last Monday. Alkali described the attackers as agents of darkness, saying the action shows that the opponents of Olopoeyan are nervous and finding it difficult to relax over his defection to NNPP. This was contained in a congratulatory message on his wise decision to join the party. According to the letter, “I wish to use this medium to welcome you into the NNPP family and also congratulate you for taking that wise decision. “You will quite agree with me that our dear country, Nigeria, is passing through a critical phase in its chequered history that requires the concerted effort of well-meaning individuals like you to bring her back from the precipice. “Your pride of place in the political firmament of your dear State is not in contention, coupled with your rich experience. All these have placed you in a vantage point to join in the effort to SAVE OUR DEMOCRACY and RESCUE OUR NATION. “With your decision to join the moving train, you have written your name in gold, when the history of this great country is being produced for coming generations. “I also want to seize this opportunity to inform you that the entire leadership of NNPP regrets the attack on your house by agents of darkness, on Monday, 10th April 2022, the day you publicly declared for NNPP. POLL “This is a clear sign that your political opponents are jittery. It is a testimony to the fact that you are a force to reckon with in Nigerian politics. We solidarize with you and your family. We pray that Allah willcontinue to guide and protect your household. “While wishing you all the best in your future endeavours, please accept my warm regards”.
