The Katsina Local Government election from across most areas visited have been marred by voter apathy, delay in the arrival of election materials at various polling units and complaints by some political party agents of non-availability of election results sheets, among others. The story was virtually similar in all the polling units visited in Dutsinma, Kankara, Katsina, Batagarawa, Kankia, Musawa and Safana Local Government Areas of the state. Daily Independent also reported that the scenario wasn’t different in Bakori, where the election materials were burnt by irate youth, while at Malumfashi distribution of materials is ongoing as of 1:30 pm. The agents who spoke under condition of anonymity told our reporter that, while the Peoples Democratic Party complained of non-arrival of election results sheets as of 8.45 am, the All Progressives Congress  (APC) agents at Turawa A and B polling units in the Batagarawa Local Government Area made similar complaints about non-availability of same results sheets. Accreditation of voters was yet to commence at many polling units visited by 9.30 am, despite the fact that the election was slated for between 8 am to 3 pm. It was also observed that there are fewer voters turned out at polling units despite the state Government’s declaration of Monday as work-free to allow people to carry out their civic responsibility. Trading and commercial activities were also seen to have resumed in Katsina at 10 am and in the surrounding towns of Batagarawa, Kayauki, Charanchi and Kankia, despite police restrictions on both human and vehicular movements within the state. Attempts to get the reaction of the Chairman of the Katsina State Independent Electoral Commission, Ibrahim Bako, on the several complaints proved abortive as he was said to have gone out to inspect the election exercise.
