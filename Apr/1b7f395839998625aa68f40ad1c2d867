Ahead of the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) presidential Primaries, the Governor of Sokoto State, Aminu Waziri Tambuwal has revealed why the leadership of the party need to maintain a consensus candidate for the 2023 presidential elections. The presidential aspirant who submitted his nomination and expression of interest form in Abuja on Tuesday stated that consensus remained the best option for the leading opposition platform in Nigeria. Tambuwal, who is optimistic that a consensus arrangement would favour him said, “Consensus is a good thing. It is healthy for the party. Our prayer is that the consensus will favour me”, his ally, Nicholas Msheliza told reporters. “I am the frontline aspirant. Our thinking, our prayer and hope is that the consensus will go my way.” However, the Tambuwal camp has said  the aspirant enjoys acceptability among the PDP family nationwide. Others in the race are ex-Vice President Atiku Abubakar, ex-Senate Presidents Bukola Saraki and Anyim Pius Anyim, Governors Bala Mohammed (Bauchi) and Nyesom Wike (Rivers), and ex-Anambra Governor Peter Obi.
