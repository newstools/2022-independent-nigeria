Pastor Christian Amanze, a cleric with the Lord’s Chosen Charismatic Revival Ministries, has admonished couples to be romantic and submit themselves to one another. Amanze, who stated this last weekend when the church wedded 18 couples in a group marriage organised by its marriage committee, stressed that “romance not a sin.” He called on the men not to mince words in expressing their love to their wives as seen in songs of Solomon. According to him, there are always blessings that come with marriage as seen in Genesis Chapter 1 verse 28, “And God blessed them, and God said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it: and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth.” He stated that that blessings could be lost through sin, even as he asked the newly wedded not to go against the will of God for marriages. He said: “When God proclaimed those blessings on man sin was not found in them. After sin, curse entered marriage; sin brought hardship, sorrow and curse.” One of the newly wedded couples, Mr Kevin Ukwuoma and Mrs Amarachi Light Ikwueme, while describing marriage as a union, said, “marriage as a union is where each person is expected to complement the others weakness in love. The groom said that the group marriage arrangement was a method of cutting down on wedding costs to suit the subsisting economic meltdown that has been withholding many from going into marriage.
