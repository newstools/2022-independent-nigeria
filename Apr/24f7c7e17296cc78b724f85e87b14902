Governor Ahmadu Umaru Fintiri of Adamawa State has denied the news making rounds that the Rivers State Governor, Nyasom Ezenwo Wike, has picked him as his Vice Presidential candidate ahead of the 2023 general election on the platform of the People’s Democratic Party (PDP). Speaking on his arrival at the Yola International Airport, Governor Fintiri said that he was not nursing any Vice Presidential aspirations or that he has been picked by anybody. He, however, disclosed that he was working to return back to Government House to complete his laudable projects which are meant to reposition Adamawa State and reduce poverty and underdevelopment which has been pledging the State since it’s creation. Governor Fintiri pointed out that he was not nursing any ambition whatsoever as been speculated in some quarters. He said his friend and colleagues Governor Wike has not consulted him on his ambition or even picking him as a Vice Presidential candidate so he was unperturbed about any other noises but a single handed dispensation to come back for the second time as Adamawa State Governor to complete the massive construction going on across the State which would better reposition the state than for him to run for the Vice Presidential slot of anybody. He further stated that his determination is the oneness of the PDP to take over the nation and Adamawa State in the 2023 general elections so that poverty and underdevelopment would end. He assured the nation that insecurities and criminality across the land would end once the PDP takes over the country in 2023. He asked the Nígerian people to put their faith in PDP which would end the extreme poverty and security challenges being experienced across the country now.
