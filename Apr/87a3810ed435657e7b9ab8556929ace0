Gary Lineker has weighed in on Liverpool’s win over Everton in the Premier League. The Reds claimed a 2-0 win over the local rivals in the 240th Merseyside derby, thanks to half goals from Andy Robertson and Divock Origi. Both goals came in the second half, with the score line goalless going into the half-time interval. Origi made his first league appearance for Liverpool since coming on in a late cameo in the 6-0 win over Leeds United in February. He entered the fray on the hour mark and went on to bag his sixth goal of the season in all competitions. Victory for Liverpool means they are back to one point behind leaders Manchester City, who themselves claimed a 5-1 win over Watford on Saturday. Both sides now have five league fixtures left to play this term. Liverpool are also competing in the Champions League and FA Cup, to go along with the Carabao Cup already in their possession. Lineker provided an assessment of the Reds’ chances of achieving an unprecedented quadruple, as well as Origi scoring against Everton for the sixth time. “Liverpool’s relentless pursuit of the quadruple remains a possibility,” wrote Lineker. “No shock it was Divock that helped to unlock Everton’s low block.”
