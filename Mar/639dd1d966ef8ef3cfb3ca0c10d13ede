During the All Progressives Congress (APC) National Convention held at Eagles Square in Abuja on Saturday, Vice President Yemi Osinbajo declared that the ruling party will continue to build the Nigeria that all citizens will be proud of. Osinbajo who made this declaration in a statement issued by his media aide, Laolu Akande noted that the ruling party would actualise the pledge of universal health coverage for all. He, however, urged the new leaders of the party to “focus on the objective of taking 100 million out of poverty in this decade, as promised by this government under the leadership of President Muhammadu Buhari. Speaking during the convention, the VP said, “We will continue undaunted in the task of building infrastructure that will be the foundation of the great modern economy of our dreams. “We will continue in the task of building a strong, united, fair and just Nigeria; a Nigeria where every young man and woman can find opportunities to work and prosper. “We will not relent; we will not look back and we will not falter. And by the grace of God, this party, our party, the All Progressives Congress, will in the coming decades lead Nigeria and its great peoples to its manifest destiny. “The years of the building are always difficult, and sometimes, painful. The building of a great edifice requires deep roots into the ground and a foundation as deep sometimes into the ground as the grand edifice that it will support. “We cannot deny the difficulties we as a party, and the government, and indeed our people have been through. POLL “We have had to tackle terrorist activities, insurgency and security challenges in parts of the country. But our people have remained steadfast, resilient and determined to see the Nigeria of our dreams. And our government has also remained steadfast, determined, committed and focused.”
