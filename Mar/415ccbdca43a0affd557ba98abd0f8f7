Nigerian disc jockey, Florence Otedola, popularly known as DJ Cuppy, has expressed her thoughts on the recent Nigeria versus Ghana match which was held in Abuja on Tuesday. She disclosed this in a video which was posted on her official Instagram page, with the caption, “When someone asks what I think about the NGAvsGHA match.” According to the singer, she doesn’t have the time to answer such questions about the match. “I do not have the time for this, I do not have the time for you,” she said while mimicking a voiceover in the video she posted. Recall that the Super Eagles lost the chance to play at the World Cup Games, after Ghana won the World Cup Qualifiers game on away goals.
