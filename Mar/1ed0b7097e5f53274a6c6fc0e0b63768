KANO – A middle-aged man simply identified as Dada, a resident of Oziokutu, Ogaminana, headquarters of Adavi local government area of Kogi state was seen on a viral video tearing his wife’s clothes after an altercation between the couple. The one minutes, thirteen seconds tape saw neighbours pleading with the man to stop the act, as helpless wife also pleaded tearfully, begging him in the name of God and his Messenger (SAW), but all to no avail. (UPDATE) Missing BRT Passenger: We Have Arrested Driver –… Kidnappings: Ex NOA Boss Bemoans Frequent Attacks On Traditional… Social media users have reacted towards the man’s action bitterly, some said he isn’t worthy of being called Mallam (a religious figure) while some people asked for immediate arrest of the man. Kano based Lawyer, Barrister Sulaiman Abdurraheem in his reaction said the first approach is to report this man to the police. Barrister Sulaiman noted that “There are laws on Gender Based Violence (GBV) and Domestic Violence (DV) against Women of this nature. But the problem is in its implementation, like in all our laws. He, therefore, urged Human Rights NGO in Okene to take the matter to enable the victim to get justice.
