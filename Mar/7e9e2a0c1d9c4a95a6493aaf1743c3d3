Another Russian Lieutenant-General, Yakov Rezantsev, has been killed in Ukraine. According to the BBC, Ukraine’s defence ministry says Rezantsev was killed in a strike at the Chornobaivka airbase, southern city of Kherson, Ukraine on Friday. The Lieutenant-General was the commander of Russia’s 49th combined army. Rezantsev was the second lieutenant general, the highest rank officer reportedly killed since the war between Russia and Ukraine started last month. Recall that Ukraine had last week said it had killed Russian Lieutenant-General Andrei Mordvichev during an attack on an airfield in the south of the country. The war between Russia and Ukraine began in February. Russian President Vladimir Putin had ordered the invasion of Ukraine over disagreements on some political issues. As of today, several casualties have already been recorded.
