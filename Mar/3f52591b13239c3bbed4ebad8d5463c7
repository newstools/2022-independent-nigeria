The People’s Democratic Party (PDP) on Thursday raised an alarm over the alleged plan by President Muhammadu Buhari-led All Progressives Congress (APC) to compromise the 2023 general elections. The opposition party stated that the alleged plot is to “alter the newly passed Electoral Act 2022, to introduce clauses that will favour the ruling party ahead of the 2023 general elections.” In a statement issued by its  National Publicity Secretary, Debo Ologunagba, PDP said APC, having realized that it was running out of time and could not meet up with the already released electoral timetable, now sought to frustrate and derail the ongoing electoral process. The party said it has it on good authority that the Buhari presidency has perfected plots to use the APC leadership in the National Assembly to orchestrate an amendment to the Electoral Act to create an opening for INEC to alter its already released 2023 Election Timetable and Schedule of Activities to accommodate the APC. The PDP further claim that for the party to achieve this, APC has been mounting pressure on INEC “to push forward the already dates for the 2023 General elections”, but said it strongly rejects the move. He said: “Our party has information about how the APC has been mounting pressure on INEC to push forward the already scheduled dates for the 2023 general elections. “The PDP vehemently rejects this plot by the APC which amounts to shifting the goal post in the middle of the game and cautions INEC to resist such heinous design against our democracy. “The election timetable has already been released, political parties have commenced processes, Nigerians have since set their minds on the election dates to vote out the APC and there is no going back on that resolve.” POLL The party also urged all PDP members in the National Assembly to be vigilant and firmly resist this plot.
