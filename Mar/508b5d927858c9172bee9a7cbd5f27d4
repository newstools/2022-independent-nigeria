Nwifuru who made the announcement during the plenary attended by only APC lawmakers declared Hon. Victor Aleke, Hon Mrs Franca Okpo and Hon Okechukwu Ali seats are vacant. This is coming barely one week after a Federal High Court presided over by Justice Inyang Ekwo, declared vacant, Speaker Nwifuru’ seat and that of 15 other APC Lawmakers, for defecting to the All progressives Congress (APC) from the People’s Democratic Party (PDP). The Speaker and the 14 APC Lawmakers had before the Court judgement that sacked them, declared vacant, the seat of the Deputy Speaker of the House, Odefa Obasi Ofeda, and two other Lawmakers of the PDP, namely; Hon Oliver Osi and Hon Ngozi Eziulo. The trio had since approached the court which reversed the decision of the House. The Speaker and the 14 APC lawmakers had, last week, while reacting to the court judgment which sacked them, said they were dissatisfied with the judgement and had filed an appeal and stay of execution. But as of the time of filing this report, it was not certain whether the Speaker and the 14 APC lawmakers had got the stay of execution of the judgment that sacked them from the House.
