The Nigerian Integrity Initiative (TNII) has petitioned the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, EFCC, and other anti-graft agencies, requesting for a revisit to some alleged corrupt cases leveled against the former deputy President of the Senate, Senator Ike Ekweremadu. The group expressed concern over the dormancy and inaction on the alleged infractions of Ekweremadu since 2015. In a petition to different anti-corruption and law enforcement agencies of the federal government, the group said that Senator Ekweremadu should be used as a test case if the Nigeria law enforcement agencies and the judiciary want Nigerians to rekindle their confidence in them. The petition which was released to newsmen asked for a re-investigation and conclusion of the dormant Fraud, Forgeries and other Corrupt related Cases against Ekweremadu by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC); The Independent Corrupt Practices and Other Related Offences Commission (ICPC); The Nigeria Financial Intelligence Unit (NFIU); The Code Of Conduct Tribunal (CCT); The Auditor General of Federation; The Inspector General Of Police; The Attorney General Of Federation and Minister For Justice. In the petition authored by the National Coordinator, Bagbadamosi Ali; National Secretary, Suleiman Ahman; and the Zonal Coordinator (South East), Onyekachi Madi; TNII said it was aware of conspicuously celebrated corrupt cases against of the former deputy President of the Senate, Senator Ike Ekweremadu, whom it alleged that his malfeasance and other infringements of the law were in the public domain but have remained inconclusive or suppressed. “We are therefore interested in revisiting these matters for the sake of keeping Nigeria on the path of growth. Conclusions of these corrupt cases with their appropriate punishments help to create fear among the Citizens and ultimately lead to the eradication of sleazes in the nation’s polity.” The group went on to give details of the allegation on Senator Ekweremadu as follows: “In December, 2015, members of the National Assembly Committee on the Review of the 1999 Constitution, headed by Senator Ike Ekweremadu as chairman of the committee, withdrew N7.75 billion purportedly to amend the Nigerian constitution. The money was collected in tranches between 2011 and 2015. The Senate Committee led by Ike Ekweremadu, withdrew a total of N4, 500,000.00 for the exercise. The Committee withdrew money from its account a few days before the March 28, 2015 general elections. On March 2, it withdrew N83.33m. The committee also withdrew the same amount 21 days later, precisely on March 23. Yet, on April 13, two days after the governorship election, it withdrew another N83.33m. “The Ekweremadu Committee reportedly transferred the sum of N125m on April 21, 2010 to Bank PHB; N250m on June 10, 2010 to Oceanic Bank; N125m on a date not specified; to Oceanic Bank and N250m on October 13, 2010 to Bank PHB; and the transactions were made before the Committee was inaugurated in the 7th Assembly in 2011. It also transferred N250m on a date not specified to Oceanic Bank; N250m on February 9, 2011to Bank PHB; N500m on December 16, 2011 to Bank PHB; N250m on May 17, 2012 to Bank PHB; N250m on July 23, 2013 to Keystone Bank, N250m on November 5, 2013 to Keystone Bank; N250m on February 5, 2014 to Keystone; N250m on May 22, 2014 to Keystone; N250m on August 18, 2014 to Keystone; N166.6m on November 25, 2014 to Keystone; N83.4 on December 5, 2014 to Keystone; and N83.33m on February 27, 2015 to Keystone. It further withdrew N250m on April 20, 2012; N250m on February 27, 2013; N250m on May 8, 2013; N83.33m on March 17, 2015; and N83.33 on a date not specified, in cash. POLL “Is the office of the Auditor General in the picture of how these monies were used and if any was unused, were they returned to the coffers of the federal government? Please note that Part 1, Subsection 1 of the Money Laundering Act 2011 provides that “No person or body corporate shall, except in a transaction through a financial institution, make or accept cash payment of a sum exceeding- (a) N5, 000,000.00 or its equivalent, in the case of an individual; or (b) N10, 000,000.00 or its equivalent in the case of a body corporate.” The Monies were wired variously into different bank accounts without specific dates, in clear violation of Nigeria’s money laundering law. “In 2018, the EFCC investigated Ike Ekweremadu as the Deputy Senate President for owning up to 60 assets across four countries, including Nigeria. He was quizzed to verify if he declared the assets before the Code of Conduct Bureau as stipulated for all public officers in Nigeria. Beyond Nigeria, the properties were said to be scattered in the United Kingdom, United States of America and the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Locations of some of the assets in Abuja- Nigeria were reportedly traced to No. 11, Evans Enwerem Street, Apo Legislative Quarters, Apo, Abuja; Plot 2633 Kyami, Abuja; Housing Estate (Plot 1106 CRD, Cadastral Zone 07-07, Lugbe, Abuja; Plot 2782 Asokoro Extension, Abuja, and Houses at Citi Park Estate, Gwagwalada, Abuja; Plot 1474 Cadastral Zone BD6, Mabushi, Abuja; Congress Court, Abuja; Flat 1, Block D25, Athletics Street (24th Street) Games Village, Abuja and Plot 66, 64 Crescent, Gwarinpa Estate, Abuja. Traceable Properties in the United States of America included; 4507 Stella Street, Bella Vida Estate Kissimmee, Florida, USA; 2747 Club Cortile Circle, Kissimmee, Florida, USA; 2763 Club Cortile Circle, Kissimmee, Florida, USA. In London were Flat 4 Varsity Court, Harmer Street, WIH 4NW, London and 2 Aylestone Avenue, NW6 7AB, London. The ones in Dubai, United Arab Emirates were given as Dubai Room 1903, The Address Hotel, Downtown Dubai; The Address Boulevard, 3901, Dubai; 2 Flats of Burjside Boulevard (the signature), Dubai; Emirate Gardens Apartment No. EGG1/1/114 and EGG1/115, Dubai; Apartment No. DFB/12/B 1204, Park Towers, Dubai; Flat 3604, MAG214, Dubai; Villa No 148, Maeen 1, The Lakes Emirates Hills, Dubai. “The EFCC had subsequently in August 2018 detained Ike Ekweremadu for failure to explain how he came about those properties and for failure to declare the assets in his Asset Declaration form at the CCB, but nor forfeiture has been declared on these assets. Why? “While the above matters went under the carpet, in 2020, Senator Ike Ekweremadu was named among top Nigerians linked to 800 Dubai properties worth N164bn. He was connected to eight Dubai properties, with an estimated total value of more than $7 million, including a luxury flat in Park Towers bought for $2.2 million and one in Burj Dubai purchased for $1.4 million. The two properties in the United Kingdom purchased between 2008 and 2011 were valued at 4.2 million pounds sterling. One of these properties, an upscale flat in central London, it was discovered, was registered in the name of Ekweremadu’s charitable foundation while the second, is a detached house in a leafy north London suburb. “Recall that a former Chief Judge of Enugu State, Late Justice Innocent Umezulike had in 2017 petition the then National Security Adviser (NSA), Brigadier-General Babagana Monguno (retd), to order the EFCC to probe how Ekweremadu acquired 32 choice properties in Nigeria and abroad. Ekweremadu accused the former Chief Judge of breaking into his probate to have access to his ‘Safe Haven’ where he allegedly hid his will. Umuzulike accused Ekweremmadu of living beyond his income, disclosing that prior to Ekweremadu’s entry into public office in 1999, Ekweremadu was a struggling lawyer, who lived in a depressed suburb of Enugu at No. 17. Mike Ejeagha Street, Abakpa-Nike, Enugu. In Enugu alone, Umezulike said Ekweremadu allegedly owned No. 14, Iyienu Street, Independence Layout; 7 O’Connor Street, Asata; 14/16 Charles Street, G. R. A, Enugu; 9B Isuofia Street, Shagari Low Cost Housing in Trans-Ekulu; 28 Owerri Road in Asata, House 2, Local City Garden, G. R. A; a plot at Republic Layout and 69.4 hectares of land in Ogbeke-Nike, Enugu. “Sir, Please do also recall that the Federal government had after the submission of a police report to the office of the Attorney General of the Federation in 2016, filed charges against Senate leadership, with Ekweremadu as a second respondent, where he was accused of forgery of the Senate Standing Rules. The federal government had slammed a two-count charge of criminal conspiracy, contrary to Section 97 of the Penal Code Law and Forgery contrary to 362 of the Penal Code Law,” TNII alleged. The group said it can go on and on to mention a few cases of Senator Ike Ekweremadu whom he said till date still parades the political corridor without any concluded prosecution or penalty and has the potential of committing more acts of corruption if left unpunished or even exonerated from these charges. “Posterity will not be happy with the country, particularly the appropriate agencies such as yours who overlook matters such as in the case of just one out of millions in the country. We may be left with no other option than to approach the court for an order of mandamus if matters as these are still swept under the carpet while the nation suffers. “We would however give your esteemed offices up till 21 days from the date of this publication to take action on these matters or meet us in court. We are however confident that you will revisit these matters as applicable in your offices. Please accept our highest regards for your offices,” the group concluded.
