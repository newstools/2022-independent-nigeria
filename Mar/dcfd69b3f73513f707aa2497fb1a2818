Eze, Okofia VI. At the state police command where six of their leaders, led by Mr. Philip Dilibe met with the Deputy Commissioner in charge of Operations, Mr. Peter Ozigi, they were advised to articulate their grievances for an easy solution. The police spokesman, Ikenga Tochukwu also advised that they get an attorney to articulate their matter instead of going to the streets or at worst, the villagers should put their grievances in writing. Similar advice was given to them at the police zonal command by an officer delegated to address them. Their spokesman, Mr. Philip Dilibe said they had no choice but to take to the streets because they were being intimidated by the ruler who dragged those who defend their father’s land to various police stations and state security offices. “Each time anybody complained, he will raise one allegation or the other and have the person detained. He is using poor people’s land to enrich himself in the name of kingship”, he lamented. POLL Another leader, Maxwell Maduagwuna lamented that all entreaties to the ruler to stop selling their land fell on deaf ears. Instead, he resorted to using a lackey in the village to intimidate the people.
