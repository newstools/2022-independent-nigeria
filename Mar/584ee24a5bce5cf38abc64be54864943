American singer, Beyonce Knowles will join Billie Eilish and Finneas, Reba McEntire and Sebastián Yatra in performing their Oscar-nominated songs at Sunday’s Academy Awards, show producers Will Packer and Shayla Cowan announced in a statement. Beyoncé will perform ‘Be Alive’, the theme song she wrote with songwriter Dixson and sings in ‘King Richard’, a biopic about Serena and Venus Williams’ dad Richard. Yatra will sing ‘Dos Oruguitas’ from Disney’s ‘Encanto’, written by Lin-Manuel Miranda. Eilish and Finneas will perform the James Bond theme ‘No Time to Die’, which the sister-and-brother team wrote and performed. McEntire will perform ‘Somehow You Do’, the song written by Diane Warren for ‘Four Good Days’. The fifth Oscar-nominated song, Van Morrison’s ‘Down to Joy’ from ‘Belfast’, will be not be performed on the broadcast. The academy statement said that Van Morrison “was invited” to perform his nominated song “but will not attend the Oscars due to his tour schedule.” Meanwhile, Serena and Venus Williams will be presenting an award at the ceremony. The Williams sisters were announced as part of the final group gracing the Academy Awards stage this Sunday — which includes Josh Brolin, Jacob Elordi, Jake Gyllenhaal, Jason Momoa, Jill Scott and J.K. Simmons. Also included on the final list of awards presenters are ‘West Side Story’ star, Rachel Zegler, who previously lamented not receiving an invite to the Academy Awards. Lady Gaga, who missed out on the best actress Oscar nomination for her ‘House of Gucci’ role, will be on the Academy Awards stage as a presenter. So will Anthony Hopkins, after missing last year’s Oscars show, when he upset the late Chadwick Boseman for best actor. And so will comedians Tiffany Haddish and Bill Murray.
