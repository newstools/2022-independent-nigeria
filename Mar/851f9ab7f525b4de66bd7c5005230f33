Marcus Rashford is reportedly of interest to Ligue 1 giants Paris Saint-Germain, as the Manchester United forward considers whether his long-term future lies away from Old Trafford. The French club’s interest in Rashford is being reported by independent journalist and PSG specialist Hadrien Grenier, just hours after transfer expert Fabrizio Romano broke the news that the England international’s Manchester United future is uncertain. Developments concerning Rashford’s potential availability have peaked the interest of PSG after it became known that the 24-year-old is currently doubting whether he can realise his full potential at Old Trafford. Kylian Mbappe Could Miss Real Madrid vs PSG PSG Will Do Everything Possible To Retain” Kylian Mbappe… Rashford has recently lost his place in the preferred starting eleven of Manchester United interim manager Ralf Ragnick, with the likes of Jadon Sancho and Anthony Elanga being selected ahead of him. There may prove to be a place in PSG’s line-up for Rasford next season if Mauricio Pochettino’s side make their interest in the player more concrete. 23-year-old striker Kylian Mbappé is expected by many to join Real Madrid in the summer. However, the Paris-born forward may yet decide to sign a new contract with the club. Rashford’s form in a Manchester United shirt was expected to pick up following the arrival of Ralf Ragnick after Ole Gunnar Solskjaer was sacked as the club’s manager earlier in the season. However, it could be argued that the opposite has come to transpire, with Rashford becoming increasingly used to time on the substitutes’ bench as the season goes on. POLL In 24 appearances in all competitions in 2021/22, Rashford has so far managed to find the back of the net only 5 times. The forward is understood to be concerned at his lack of game time, and wants clarity from the club as to his future prospects.
