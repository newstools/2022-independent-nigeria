BENIN – As the campaign for the 2023 general elections gathers momentum in Edo State, Senator Matthew Urhoghide has called on the people of Edo- South Senatorial District not to impute sentiments in choosing their next representative who will succeed him at the Senate next year. He said the issue that they should consider dispassionately while electing his successor is the type of development such a person is capable of attracting to the Edo-South Senatorial District. Urhoghide, who made the declaration while addressing leaders of his Edo-South Senatorial District in Benin, thanked the leaders for the opportunity given to him to serve them at the Senate since 2015. According to him, “While thanking you all, especially the leaders of this senatorial district, for being given the privilege to represent you at the Senate since 2015, let me quickly remind you that the next general elections is around the corner and we should not employ any sentiment in choosing our next representative that will serve in the 10th Senate Assembly.”
