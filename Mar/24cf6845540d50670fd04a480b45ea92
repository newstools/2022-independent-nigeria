His Royal Majesty, Oba Ewuare II on Monday, expressed concern over the increasing criminal dens in some parts of Edo State. The Benin monarch made the observation when the Chief of Air Staff, Air Marshal Oladipo Amao who was on a working visit to the state paid him a courtesy call at his palace in Benin City, Edo State Capital. The royal father alleged that based on intelligence reports these criminals are setting up camps and building ‘luxury houses’ in rural areas that are difficult for police to access. According to him, “security solutions are not to be discussed openly. However, I want to say that some information reaching us a while ago indicated that there are camps dotted all over our rural areas. “These camps are not just camps but luxury houses that you will not expect anybody to live in. They are well organised. “We need to investigate. I do not think the police have access to these areas so as to flush out these criminals made up of armed robbers and kidnappers. “I want to thank you for taking interest in the security of the State. I also commend the efficient way of tackling security especially insurgency. It is still a work in progress. The President has done a lot of work. Addressing the Benin monarch, the Chief of Air Staff, Air Marshall Oladipo Amao, alleged that some neighbourhoods in Edo State have become a hideout for Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB). POLL “We are aware that some of the neighbourhoods have become a hideout for IPOB…We have meant with the Governor” on areas of collaboration, he said. While assuring that criminal elements in the State will be flushed out, the Air Marshall sued for the support of the traditional institutions to enable its personnel to succeed in the discharge of its duties.
