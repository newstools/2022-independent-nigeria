Ahead of the 2023 general election, the Governor of Sokoto State and Chairman of the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) Governors’ Forum, Aminu Tambuwal has said that PDP remains the party to beat. Tambuwal stated this while tasking the leaders, stakeholders and members of the party to unite and work as an indivisible team in order to sack the All Progressives Congress (APC)-led government come 2023. Speaking at a consultative meeting with chairmen of the 36 state chapters of the party at the Sokoto State Governor’s Lodge, Abuja, on his aspiration to contest for the presidency, Tambuwal said the chances of the PDP to win the 2023 presidential election are bright. He, however, said there was the need for understanding and collaboration to realize what he called the “all-important goal of rescuing Nigeria”. According to him, “Consultations are ongoing and we will have to comply with the INEC guidelines as a responsible political party. “So nothing stops the consultations from continuing,” adding that “Our party stands a chance and it is the party to beat in Nigeria today.” Speaking on behalf of his colleagues, the chairman of the Kaduna State Chapter of the party, Hassan Hyat, said Tambuwal convened the meeting to officially inform them of his intention to vie for the presidency. “We are more interested in the unity of the party as our number one cardinal objective because we believe that the party has to come back to rescue Nigeria and we are asking everybody to join forces. POLL “We cannot have more than one president at a time and therefore, among all others, there must be unity of purpose amongst them just like among all other members of the party. “We want to move together and we want to make sure that whoever picks the ticket wins the election,” he said. In his remarks, a former governor of Sokoto State, Attahiru Bafarawa, reaffirmed his commitment to the actualisation of Tambuwal’s presidential ambition.
