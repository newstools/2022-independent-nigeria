Barcelona are not ready to give up on Erling Haaland just yet. With Kylian Mbappe likely to join Real Madrid next season, it appears the Catalans are keen on bagging the services of the other super-talent in the form of Haaland. The Borussia Dortmund striker is expected to leave the Bundesliga at the end of the season. While he does have a release clause of just €75 million, his hefty wage demands, coupled with agent commissions have always put off Barça, with some speculation that the entire cost of the operation could be around €250 million. However, according to Diario SPORT, Barcelona have made a last-gasp attempt to sign Haaland next season. The Blaugrana have contacted the player’s entourage, with the negotiations likely to be led by president Joan Laporta himself. The club are reportedly willing to shell out around €190 million for Haaland, over a five year period. This includes the €75 million release clause to be paid to Borussia Dortmund, along with the agent commissions for his father Alf-Inge Haaland and Mino Raiola. It also includes the player’s salary over a five year period. Recent reports suggest Haaland will be demanding a salary of around €17 million per season, which amount to a figure of around €85 million in five years. The rest are likely to be considered as commissions for the agents. Barcelona are aware that their offer might not be as lucrative as Manchester City and Real Madrid, but the club remain confident that their attractive sporting project could entice the Norwegian starlet. Fabrizio Romano has recently delivered a report suggesting Haaland won’t choose his next club based on the money involved. POLL It could play in Barcelona’s hands, though Man City and Real Madrid are considered frontrunners in the race. Haaland has remained tight-lipped on his future so far, but the Dortmund forward could announce his decision in the coming weeks.
