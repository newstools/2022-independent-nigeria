BIRNIN KEBBI – In a humanitarian gesture geared towards alleviating poverty and jobs creations to rural women, a community-based organization operating in Kebbi state have graduated no fewer than 30 rural women at Ambursa village under Birnin Kebbi local government. According to the chief executive officer of the organization, Hajia Balkisu Atuna Danga, said that the choice of rural women was informed by what she saw when she visited villages and hamlets during COVID-19 pandemic. She said because she was then a member of the COVID-19 taskforce on enlightenment, stated: “I was moved by what I saw, particularly the level of poverty and joblessness amongst rural women. This melted my heart so as the State President then of NCWS Kebbi, I used the opportunity to form it and named it women voice of leadership as my pet project,” she said. Danga added that to put into practice her idea, she sought a grant and she got it and therefore, used it to train rural women of Ambursa village on soap, pomade and liquid handwash making, among others. The pilot programme, according to her, began in April 2020 and ended in March 2022, which is roughly one year and at end of it, at least 30 rural women were graduated and were given a token as a start-up capital from the little grant she got. While targeting more rural women for another training, she appealed to donor agencies to come to the aid of the community-based organization as many more rural women have formed women groups and are willing to get the training to be self-reliant in order to reduce over-dependence on their husbands. She called on the beneficiaries to make judicious use of the capital and ensure they put in practice what they have learnt during the training.
