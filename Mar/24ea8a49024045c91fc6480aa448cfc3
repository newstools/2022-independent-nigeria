Pope Francis issued his toughest condemnation yet of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, saying on March 13 that the “unacceptable armed aggression” must stop. Speaking to thousands of people in St. Peter’s Square for his Sunday blessing, Francis also said that the killing of children and unarmed civilians was “barbaric” and with “no valid strategic reason.” He called the besieged city of Mariupol a “martyred city” and again appealed for “truly secure humanitarian corridors” to allow residents to evacuate.
