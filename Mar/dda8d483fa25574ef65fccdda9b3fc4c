Divock Origi is nearing a move to Milan at the end of the season and as the English media term it, he is ‘one step away’ from transferring to the Rossoneri colors. The soon-to-be free agent has fallen down Jurgen Klopp’s pecking order, especially since the arrival of forward Luis Diaz from Porto recently. According to the Tuttosport (via MilanNews), a four-year deal worth €4m net per season is being prepared by the Diavolo management to welcome the Belgian. 26-year-old Origi will not renew his contract at Anfield and it is expected that an agreement is reached within the next seven days. Few details over the contract are yet to be fixed, as Milan draw up the offer to fend off interest from other interested clubs from England and Italy. He has the option to qualify for an extra year in his contract via a performance option, but is currently struggling to reach the required number of games to activate that clause. Sky Sport Italia refer to Origi’s profile as an apt fit for Milan’s future needs, given the fact that strikers Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Olivier Giroud both near the final years of their respective careers. Moreover, the Belgian has experience in the biggest of games – matches that Liverpool fans will forever remember him for – a historic Champions League brace against Barcelona and a goal in the final of the 2018/19 tournament in the 2-0 win over Tottenham Hotspur. It is understood that Liverpool could use up the opportunity to target Milan winger Rafael Leao, according to Calciomercato. However, Milan have always held on strong to their Portuguese forward talent, who is currently experiencing his best season in terms of numbers at the San Siro.
