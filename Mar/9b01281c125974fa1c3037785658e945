…Says They Are Nigerians Too The Convener of Concerned Nigerian Deji Adeyanju has said Nigeria cannot survive another Yoruba Presidency in 2023. According to him, the Yoruba nation can’t produce Nigeria’s president because most of the country’s competent people are not in the southwest. In a tweet, the rights activist said the Igbos should be allowed to produce Nigeria’s president in 2023. Adeyanju tweeted, “Nigeria will not survive what some tribalistic Yoruba people are planning for 2023. Igbo presidency must be on the table now. A Yoruba person can’t be president in 2023 because power will return to the North after another 8yrs. Igbos are Nigerians too. “All the competent people are not in the South West. Power was not created for only Yoruba people. #Equity #Fairness #Justice”
