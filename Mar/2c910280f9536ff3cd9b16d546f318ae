US-based Nigerian former ac­tress, Georgina Onuoha has noted that it is disrespectful for people to go on people’s pages and demand them to address the issues they want. She was reacting to those who have been nudging her to comment on the issues Ni­geria is facing as against the Russia-Ukraine war. According to her, people are at liberty to discuss and deliberate issues as they deem fit. She stated that she finds it irritating when people come on her page demanding that she should not address issues he cares about but to focus on issues concerning Nigeria be­cause she is a Nigerian. “How cynical. I am an Igbo woman, and you cannot rat­tle me. Suffice to say that my page for over eight years has been one of the most active pages calling out the atroci­ties happening in Nigeria. @ ugezujugezu and I have dedi­cated our pages to highlight­ing the problems of Nigeria. So I find it insulting to come on my page to spew your ig­norance. If you dare it again, I will not hesitate to drag you. So be warned. “You will be insulted. If you are new to my page, it will cost you nothing to scroll down and see my many reports on Nige­ria and other global conflicts. So be warned. You do not have the right to tell me or any adult issues to address. This is an open social platform, you have it, and you can use your page to address the issues you ask of me,” she wrote on Ins­tagram. She further sounded a warn­ing to all the ‘miscreants’ com­menting on her page regarding the ongoing war in Ukraine. “This is my page, and I will discuss whatever I want. If it bothers you, please scroll along to other celebrities who show you their butts and stu­pidity. I am not one of those. I am cut from a different fab­ric. Those who appreciate my commentary learn and give constructive criticism are welcomed and appreciated. “If you dare insult rath­er than contribute, you will get double the dose of what you give. So be warned,” she added.
