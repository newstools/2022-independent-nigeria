Travellers are speedily turning backwards.” Just got a distress call that Bandits in large numbers have again blocked the Kaduna-Abuja road this afternoon.Travellers are speedily turning backwards. Recall that earlier today, the former law maker also tweeted about engaging the youth of the surrounding villages along Kaduna-Abuja road with weapons to protect the road and rail track. He wrote, “There are 37 villages along Kaduna-Abuja road, if the Govt can recruit,arm  & engage the youths of this villages to protect the road & the rail track. “It’ll be cheaper & more effective than blowing N71 Billion in the name of surveillance or whatever ‘solution systems’ they call it.” There are 37 villages along Kaduna-Abuja road,if the Govt can recruit,arm  & engage the youths of this villages to protect the road & the rail track,it’ll be cheaper & more effective than blowing N71 Billion in the name of surveillance or whatever ‘solution systems’ they call it.
