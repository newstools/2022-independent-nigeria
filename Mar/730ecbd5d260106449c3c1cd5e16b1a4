 ABUJA  – A presidential candidate on the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Dr. Nwachukwu Anakwenze, has declared that he is 10 times more qualified than all the aspirants that have purchased their expression of interest and nominations forms so far. Those who have purchased their forms so far aside Anak­wenze are; Atiku Abubakar, Bukola Saraki, Bala Moham­med, Aminu Tambuwal, Dele Momodu, Oliver Tarila Diana and Pius Anyim. Addressing newsmen shortly after picking his ex­pression of interest and nom­ination forms, Anakwenze said he’s more experienced more qualified in education and has better superior idea than other aspirants. Asked if he can match oth­er aspirants, who are already grounded in politics, Anak­wenze said, “I am 10 times more qualified than many of them or all of them com­bined and I will tell you why. Since I came out of school, I employed 4,000 men in my company in America, 90% of them are whites from Chi­nese and India. We provide health care for California. “I am trained in business; I can run gas, oil companies and refineries. I am very ex­perienced in business, I am a trained doctor, I have other companies and I work well with the different groups in America. So in terms of expe­rience, they don’t have much experience than me. In fact, medical doctors are the high­est paid workers in America. If you can manage them, there’s nothing you cannot manage. “I told you my idea is supe­rior to all these people com­bined and I am more experi­enced and more qualified in education than them. I have three certificates- PhD in Medicine, Masters in public health and Masters in busi­ness administration. “Tell them to bring their certificate to compare. Tell them to show me what they have built for themselves and run other than just getting a job, sitting down and collect­ing salary, what have they built for themselves? I will rebuild Nigeria using the young people.”
