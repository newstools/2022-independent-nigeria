A former Aviation Minister, Femi Fani-Kayode has criticized Kaduna StateGovernor Nasir El-Rufai’s comment on the removal of Yobe State Governor Mai Mala Buni as the acting Chairman of the All Progressives Congress(APC). According to FFK, El-Rufai’s comment that President Muhammadu Buhari approved Buni’s removal as APC acting Chairman is baseless and unwarranted. El-Rufai said Buhari approved Buni’s removal before he embarked on his medical vacation to the United Arab Emirates (UAE).

However, Fani-Kayode dismissing El-Rufai’s claims on Channels Television on Friday, said he doubted if the President ever approved Buni’s removal. He said, “I was not there when the President ordered the removal of Buni. Neither was he there. I doubt very much if the President would do that, to listen to one side and ignore the order. I doubt if he would do that without following the law.” “I have never seen a situation where the minister or governor or even party chairman would come on national TV and say the President has endorsed someone and everybody ought to sit down. The President of this country is a democratic, decent person who would never act that way. “Even if the President told them that, it is not right for El-Rufai to come on national TV and disclose that or begin to paint the President as if he were kind of a dictator. We are in a country of laws that must be regarded. If the President wants to remove Buni, we would do it according to the law,” he added.
