LAGOS – In the aftermath of the Super Eagles’ inability to qualify for the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar, the Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) has been charged to look inward and reorganize the national team. The former coach of the women’s national team, the Super Falcons, while in a chat with DAILY INDEPENDENT on the country’s failure to reach the World Cup, said the Black Stars succeeded in teaching their arch-rivals some lessons, admitting that Nigeria was not disgraced but taught a lesson in a bitter way. The coach said the football house needed to look inward towards the Nigeria Professional Football League. “We were disciplined but not disgraced. It was unfortunate that we failed to qualify but everything happens for good. “The NFF has not done enough as always but I was not surprised. We saw this coming and spoke severally about it but we were not taking seriously. “It is now time to revising certain issues regarding the team; it is time to look beyond certain interests in the team and stop certain characters. We have a League here that is begging for attention and so on. “I am speaking to you in parable and I hope you understand what I mean; we have to start looking and doing things right now but thank God we were disciplined by the Black Stars but we were not disgraced,” he said. Recall that the Super Eagles forced the Black Stars to a 1-1 draw on Tuesday, a result that meant that Nigeria was halted from their quest for a seventh appearance at the global stage. POLL Thus, the quintet of Ghana, Cameroon, Senegal, Morocco and Tunisia will be representing Africa at the 2022 World Cup billed for Qatar in November.
