Lagos – The Lagos State government said it would carry out integrity assessment test on Eko Bridge, which was early Wednesday morning engulfed in fire outbreak. A statement by Dr. Frederic Oladeinde, Commissioner for Transportation, Lagos State, said that the integrity assessment would enable the government to ascertain the level of damage caused by the fire incidence for adequate rehabilitation of the bridge. The government also said that it has shut down the Apongbon axis of the Eko Bridge and diverted traffic in the axis for the safety of motorists. He, therefore, advised motorists heading towards Apongbon from Surulere and environs to use Ijora/ Apapa route or Leventis/ UBA Roundabout to connect Marina and their desired destinations. Besides, he also advised motorists to use Ebute Ero to link Inner Marina and Third Mainland Bridge to continue their journey and affirmed that the State Traffic Management Authority (LASTMA) was already on ground along the alternative routes to minimise inconveniences. Oladeinde, however, empathised with owners of shops razed down during the inferno and reiterated that the state government was fully committed to ensuring safety of the commuting public within the metropolis.
