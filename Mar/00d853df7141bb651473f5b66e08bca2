Former Senate President Bukola Saraki, Governor Aminu Tambuwal of Sokoto State and Governor Bala Mohammed of Bauchi State have outrightly denied the news making rounds that they have withdrawn from the presidential race. There is a news report making rounds that the trio had stepped down for former Vice President Atiku Abubakar to clip the presidential ticket of the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) ahead of the 2023 general election following the meeting held with Wazirin Adamawa on Monday in Abuja According to the online newspaper report on Monday, March 29, 2022, stated that Saraki, Governor Tambuwal of Sokoto State and his counterpart in Bauchi, Bala Mohammed, have stepped down for Atiku. Reacting to the development in a statement issued on Wednesday by the Director-General, Saraki Campaign Council, Earl Osaro Onaiwu, dismissed the report as “sheer mischief”. Clarifying the situation, Onaiwu said that Saraki and the governors only met Atiku with the sole objective to inform him of their push toward a consensus candidate, adding that there was no talk of anyone stepping down “as it is yet premature” The statement read, “Our candidate is eminently qualified for the PDP presidential as a former two-term governor, Chairman of the Governors Forum, Senate President and a former presidential aspirant. “Governor Aminu Tambuwal as former Speaker of the House of Representatives and a serving two-term governor is also qualified to be considered for the ticket. “Governor Bala Mohammed, a former senator, ex-minister and a serving governor is qualified for the ticket.” POLL ”No other aspirant should hide under the “nebulous assumption” that he is overly qualified than others to be stepped down for. The statement added that if there is a concrete agreement on a winning consensus and others step down for whoever, “it will be done openly”. “Until then, Senator Bukola Saraki, Tambuwal and Mohammed are still in the race”, Onaiwu added.
