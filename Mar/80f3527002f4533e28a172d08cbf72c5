Dr. George Moghalu, a former national auditor of the All Progressives Congress (APC) and governorship aspirant in the last Anambra State election, has lamented the sad state of the party in the South-East geopolitical zone, observing that newcomers to the party have hijacked the party. Speaking with journalists on the sidelines of the concluded APC national convention, the Director General, Nigeria Inland Waterways Authority ( NIWA), expressed concern that stakeholders from the zone were attending the party’s National Convention without the benefit of knowing them in the new National Working Committee (NWC) of the party. While he admitted that APC courted and invited the former People’s Democratic Party (PDP) elements to join the APC, he said it was not for them to appropriate the house and chase the rest of APC foundation members in the zone away. According to him, leaders of the party, including Governors Hope Uzodinma, Dave Umahi, of Ebonyi and Anambra states, immediate past Deputy governor and a host of other newcomers to APC, are now calling the shot in the South-East geopolitical zone even though they never knew how the APC was formed.
