The Chairman of the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) Zoning Committee and Governor of Benue State, Samuel Ortom has restated the committee’s commitment to producing a zoning formula that reflects the diversity in the party. Ortom stated this on Tuesday while speaking at the 37-man zoning committee’s second meeting held in Abuja, adding that its mandate has been extended to April 5 as it is far from achieving its goal. According to him, seven presidential aspirants have purchased the nomination and expression of interest forms to compete for the PDP presidential ticket ahead of the party primary slated for May 28th and 29th 2022. He added that the party is under pressure to zone its national offices in a way that does not put the party at risk of fragmentation with aspirants drawn from various geo-political zones. He said, “The meeting is yet to be concluded. We have adjourned till Tuesday next week at the same time, at the same venue. And until we conclude the proceedings, there is not much to say. “So far, all the members are quite understanding. There wasn’t any form of tension. “All the members understand ourselves that zoning is very key and we are looking at it that at the end of it all, we will do something that everybody will accept and we will go ahead as one big family and win the 2023 elections.”
