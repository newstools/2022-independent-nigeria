22-year-old Eretan Debby has emerged winner of the debut season of Africa Magic’s game show, Come Play Naija. She won the grand prize of a brand-new car and 15 million naira after a keenly contested endurance game, which started Friday night and lasted for over 10 hours. The first runner up, Som­to, won the sum of 2 million Naira and second runner-up, Yomi, won 1.5 million Naira. The finale show started out with all 38 contestants placing one hand on the brand new car, as instructed by the host, Hero Daniels. As the show progressed, the contestants were given the op­portunity to forfeit the grand prize and play other games to win smaller cash prizes. Con­testants who decided to take part in t\he games won cash prizes ranging from 100,000 Naira to 500,000 Naira. Four contestants took part in the first voluntary game segment worth 800,000 Naira with the winner tak­ing home 500,000 Naira and the others winning 100,000 Naira each. One of the contestants was given the opportunity to win 300,000 Naira without playing any games and another won 500,000 Naira after joining the host for a late meal. Some contestants were disqualified for breaking the game rules and as such went home with nothing. However, it was the trio of Debby, Som­to and Yomi who stuck to the game until early Saturday morning.
