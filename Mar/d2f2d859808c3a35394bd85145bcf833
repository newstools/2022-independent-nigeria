Manchester City are said to be closing in on the signing of Borussia Dortmund star Erling Haaland for a total outlay of £100m. The Norway striker is one of the most sought-after players in world football thanks to his performances so far in his short career. During his time in Germany alone, he has been averaging more than a goal a game thanks to his 80 strikes in 79 appearances. Real Madrid and Barcelona have been frequently linked with Haaland. 90min understands Barça remain ‘hopeful’ of bringing him to Camp Nou and are one of the clubs who would be willing to pay more than his current £63m release clause.

They say personal terms have been discussed and the transfer is ready to be ‘signed off’ by those in charge at City. Haaland’s release clause stands at £63m, though a hefty payment to his agent Mino Raiola and a signing-on bonus are expected to take the total cost of the deal to around £100m. The Times add that City still need to persuade Haaland to ditch his dream of playing for Real Madrid. However, should Kylian Mbappe sign for the Spanish giants, it would strengthen City’s stance. Haaland wants to be the best footballer in the world and knows he can rank among the global superstars as long as he is the top player at his next club. POLL City have not had a conventional striker since Sergio Aguero left for Barcelona. The likes of Riyad Mahrez, Kevin De Bruyne and Raheem Sterling have taken up most of the goalscoring burden so far this season, while former number nine Gabriel Jesus has almost exclusively played as a winger this season.
