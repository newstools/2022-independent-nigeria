LAGOS – ILO Director-General, Guy Ryder, has urged the international community to close the gap between visionary statements of ambition and the collective action that’s needed to address the social and economic fall-out of the COVID-19 pandemic. Ryder in remarks at the opening of the ILO’s Global Forum for a Human-centred Recovery , highlighted the inequalities, widened by the pandemic, which have hit the weakest hardest. He said: “The current trajectory, be it one of recovery, is prolonging and accentuating this divergence,” he said. “We simply must act to check and reverse these dynamics, which otherwise will make our world more unfair and ultimately more dangerous.” Helping Youths, Vulnerable To Secure Decent Livelihoods My Joy –… U.S. Consulate Supports Mentoring Programme For 125 Young… “By building new and concrete lines of joint action and cooperation in each of the areas the forum will address – inclusive growth and decent jobs, universal social protection, protecting workers and sustaining enterprises, and a just transition to carbon neutrality – we can contribute importantly to a breakthrough scenario with tangible consequences.” The three-day Forum brings together heads of State and Government, heads of international organizations and multilateral development banks, and employers’ and workers’ leaders from around the world to propose concrete actions that will strengthen the international response to the COVID-19 crisis. António Guterres, UN Secretary-General, while speaking at the opening session, told delegates that the Forum “comes at a crucial time when our ability to recover from this pandemic – and rescue the Sustainable Development Goals – hangs in the balance”.
