ABUJA – President Muhammadu Buhari has just arrived the Eagle Square Abuja, the venue of the All Progressive Congress national convention. Buhari got to the venue at exactly 8:24 pm. Prior to the convention most of the governors had indicated that they will support whoever President Muhammadu Buhari puts forward to occupy the chairmanship seat. They had met with Buhari over the week, after being led to the State House by the Chairman of the Interim Committee of the party and Governor of Yobe State, Mai Mala Buni. While Buhari had last month said he was in favour of the consensus model for selecting candidates for the party’s national positions, he is believed to be in support of Abdullahi Adamu, a former governor of Nasarawa State.
