WARRI – Chief Great Ovedje Ogboru, popularly referred to as the People’s General because of his tsunamic appearance in the Delta State political space in 2003, has dumped the All Progressives Congress so as to find relevance elsewhere. This was confirmed by a top member of the Ogboru support group who pleaded anonymity. DAILY INDEPENDENT source disclosed that Chief Great Ogboru felt disappointed that the ward, LGA and State congresses of the APC against which he complained have been ratified by the national leadership of the party, leaving him and his supporters in the cold. DAILY INDEPENDENT source added that Great Ogboru would be making his new political party known in a matter of days so as to provide a platform for his supporters to run for elective positions in the 2023 general elections. He added that Ogboru, who had been on the ballot in all gubernatorial elections in Delta State since 2003, was hoping for a National Chairman of the APC that could restore him to prime position of respect within the party, stressing that the emergence of Alhaji Abdulahi Adamu has further reinforced the hold of Senator Ovie Omo-Agege on the party and that since he was not willing to work with the DSP, the best he could do was to leave the party. Meanwhile, an aide to Senator Ovie Omo-Agege, Hon D.J Ben Sharta has expressed satisfaction with the successful outcome of the APC National convention, stressing that the plan by Great Ogboru to leave APC was unfortunate though not unexpected. Hon D.J. Ben Sharta, who was APC candidate for House of Assembly in 2019 for Udu Constituency, noted that Ogboru leaving APC will not affect the fortune of the party as APC was ever more ready to defeat PDP and form the government in Delta State by 2023. He called on party faithful to be steadfast ahead of the poll, adding that APC was coming out stronger and that the party will win the presidency and Delta State to end the PDP reign in the state in 2023.
