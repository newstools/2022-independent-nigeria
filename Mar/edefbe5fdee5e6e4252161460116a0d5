Securex West Africa will return in May to reunite its community and act as a catalyst in kicking off business sales in the new normal.The West Africa’s leading exhibition and conference for the security, safety, fire and facilities management sectors promises to engage, inspire and connect its more than 3,000 audience members over three days from May 10-12, 2022, at the Landmark Centre, Lagos.Returning for its 10th Edition, delayed since 2019 due to the pandemic, the organisers are excited about what is in store.The Regional Director, George Pearson, said: “Since the last event, we have been hard at work bringing in new elements to the show and refreshing the offering and we can’t wait to showcase it in Lagos once again”.The new elements are the launch of dedicated exhibition areas and conference themes aimed at the Fire, Safety, Smart Cities and Facilities Management industries.These will support the parent brand of Securex to provide a full 360 approach for public and private sector workers who manage the security and safety needs of their organisations, buildings or sites.Sponsors for this year’s event include Halogen Group, Net Global Systems, Redleaf, Servo Direct and ZK Teco with supporting partners to include Nigeria Security and Civil Deference Corps, The British Deputy High Commission, ASIS Lagos Chapter, International Institute of Professional Security and OSHAssociation, among others.Pearson added that he “was delighted to be supported by such a quality array of partners”.The exhibitor line-up is also something to shout about with many companies in attendance for the first time, including Aeronautics, Danfoss, Detego, Powered Global Services, Tysers and Trackforce Valiant, as well as some of the long-standing partners to the exhibition including A1-Fence, Multimesh, Nemtek, SB Tel and Synergetics to name but a few of the over 80 brands present.And if that was enough, the organisers also said that for the first time, the exhibition has partnered with the industry’s leading networking platform that will enable all participants to reach out and connect with all other attendees before they arrive on site in order to set up meetings and ensure they do not miss anyone at the live event.
