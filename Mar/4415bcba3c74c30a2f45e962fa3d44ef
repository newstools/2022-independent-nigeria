Former President Olusegun Obasanjo has denied the news making rounds that he endorsed the South-East to produce the next president in the 2023 general elections. Obasanjo stated this while reacting to a news report that he has backed an Igbo man to succeed President Muhammadu Buhari in 2023 and that the South East could develop the country if elected. According to the online platform that published the news, the former leader gave his backing to the Southeast while receiving a presidential aspirant and chieftain of the People’s Democratic Party (PDP), Mao Ohuabunwa, at his residence in Abeokuta on Thursday. 2023: Use Technology To Mobilise For PDP, Ayu Charges Youths 2023: Why Nigeria Is Not Moving Forward – Fayemi Speaking in a statement issued by his spokesman, Kehinde Akinyemi, Obasanjo outrightly denied endorsing the South-East for the presidency or any aspirant for that matter ahead of the 2023 polls. Obasanjo, however, accused Ohuabunwa of being the brain behind the report and misquoting him to favour his presidential ambition. According to him, the PDP chieftain came to visit him and he received him as a gentleman and in the spirit of his 85th birthday celebrations and not to endorse him. He said, “If that was the way the presidential aspirant wanted to approach his ambition, such as a wrong way. “He came here and the former president received him as a gentleman and in the spirit of his 85th birthday celebrations only for him to go and put words into his mouth. Baba is not that sort of man and if that is the way he wants to fulfil his ambition, that is a wrong way.”
