Following the arrest of the immediate past Governor of Anambra State, Willie Obiano over N42bn state fund, former National Chairman of the All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA), Senator Victor Umeh has claimed that Obiano managed the state’s funds well during his time in office. Daily Independent had on Thursday reported that the operatives of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) arrested Obiano at the Murtala Muhammad International Airport, Lagos, hours after handing over to his successor, Prof. Charles Soludo. Reacting to the development in a statement in Enugu on Saturday, Umeh said he is assured that the former governor used the state’s money for crucial projects such as the international airport, international conference centre amongst others. He said, “It is not new in Nigeria. Most governors, when they leave office, EFCC will swarm on them. He must be given the right to be heard. We don’t know why they arrested him. But I’m sure when they listen to him, he will be able to defend himself. “One thing I keep telling people is that former governor Obiano did wonderfully well with Anambra money. He used our money well to the displeasure of those in the opposition. They don’t want to accept it. “A governor who built an international airport, got it commissioned and working. Planes are coming in there and going and you are still looking for your money. He also built an international conference centre. “All these projects he didn’t build with sand. Apart from meeting the other obligations of running the government, meeting the needs of the people, paying workers salaries, he did so much for Anambra State. “That is why we have to be calm to allow the EFCC to finish its job. But I’m confident that Obiano will defend himself.”
