Ijaw Youths Council (IYC) has called for an investigation into the planned invasion of some riverine communities in Edo by some persons from Delta State. Omaghomi OluDerimon, Secretary, Western Zone of the Council, made the call in a press conference in Benin on Sunday. He alleged that one Eziekiel Daniel, who claimed to be a Senior Special Assistant (SSA) to Governor Ifeanyi Okowa of Delta State and one Godstime Ogidigba, are to be responsible for the planned invasion. OluDerimon noted that the planned invasion was posted on the Facebook wall of the Eziekiel, who personally mentioned Inikorogha and Gelegele as their prime targets. He stated that the duo have openly boasted that they are untouchable as they have the backing of some powerful persons in the government of Delta and Edo states.
