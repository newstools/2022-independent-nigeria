Barely four days after the 80th birthday celebration of Fabio Lanipekun, an accomplished sports journalist has passed on. Daily Independent gathered, according to a Nigeria Television Authority (NTA) official close to the family that the veteran journalists died just a week after another iconic sports journalist, Sunny Emmanuel Ojagbaese died in the United States. Confirming his death on Sunday evening, the NTA official said the cause of his death is still sketchy. Born as Adesola Lanipekun, he adopted the name ‘Fabio’ from a novel he read while he was a student at the Methodist Boys High School in Lagos.
