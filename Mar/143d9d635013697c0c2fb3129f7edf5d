The Nigeria Football Feder­ation (NFF) has felicitated with one-time FIFA referee, one-time FIFA advisor on ref­ereeing and the Federation’s Consultant on Refereeing for many years, Mr. Linus Mba, as the erudite man-of-the-whistle turned 81 on Tuesday. General Secretary of the NFF, Dr. Mohammed Sanu­si, extolled Mba’s endearing and lasting contributions to Nigeria Football, saying the one-time Member of the CAF Referees Committee has continued to acquit himself magnificently in both the professional and moral race, and indeed in all endeavours of life. “As a referee, Mba was an epitome of integrity and credibility. He was known to be fair and fearless, and built a solid reputation as a man of honour. In retirement, he has continued to work assiduously to pull Nigeria refereeing into the forefront. At the age of 81, he remains very relevant and we still seek his views and perspectives on certain issues.” Grassroots Sports Development: John Obuh Lauds Idimogu Battle Against Ghana: How Russia- Ukraine War Stops Victor Moses Modest, self-effacing and meticulous, Linus Mba served as a FIFA Advisor on Referee­ing for many years, was on the CAF Committee on Referee­ing for many years and was Consultant on Refereeing for the Nigeria Football Federa­tion until a few years ago. He still follows events in refereeing actively and with uncommon passion, and pub­lishes a quarterly magazine on refereeing which he named The Whistle.
