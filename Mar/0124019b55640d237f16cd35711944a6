A People’s Democratic Party (PDP) Governorship aspirant in Gombe State, Dr Jamilu Isyaku Gwamna, whose defection and support to the All Progressive Congress (APC) contributed to it’s victory in 2019 has rendered a public apology for his action. Dr. Jamilu Gwamna was rooted for victory during the 2019 PDP Governorship primaries but for a twist of fate at the venue of the primaries. When he couldn’t clinch the ticket, he immediately dumped the PDP, joined forces with the opposition APC to give it victory at the general elections against the ruling PDP. He made the apology repeatedly during a meeting with PDP Ward and Local Government executives in his Jekadafari ward as well as the State Party Executives in the State party Secretariat, Gombe. Giving reasons for the apology, during an interview with newsmen, Dr. Jamilu said, “why I was apologizing was because I was part and parcel of those that participated actively in the APC in Gombe State for their failings which is clear”. He added that, “I will say with a benefit of hindsight, it is just destiny”. According to him, the 2019 experience has “opened our eyes because we were still not saved after running away”. He appealed to the leaders of the party to take him back as their son as he promises to do all within his ability to help the party grow and ensure it’s victory at the polls come 2023. POLL Dr. Jamilu also requested for their votes during the party’s primaries vowing that his loyalty remains unshakable to the party’s leader and immediate past Governor of the State, Dr. Ibrahim Hassan Dankwambo. He described the ruling APC government as a failure which has nothing to offer the people of the State except poverty, terrorism and lack of appreciation. “This is why we need to change the narrative and we’ll have to do this collectively. I’ll make good my pledge that PDP will form the next Government of Gombe State in 2023”, he vowed.
