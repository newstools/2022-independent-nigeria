ABAKALIKI – A former Secretary to the Ebo­nyi State Government, Professor Benard Odoh has appealed to the people of Ebonyi State to remain calm and law-abiding over the judg­ment of an Abuja Federal High which ordered the Governor of Ebonyi State, Engr. David Umahi and his Deputy, Eric Kelechi Igwe to vacate their offices for defecting to the ruling All Progressives Con­gress, APC. The Presiding Judge, Justice Inyang Ekwo had also declared vacant the seats of the Speaker, Rt. Hon. Ogbonnaya Nwifuru and 16 other members of the Ebonyi State House of Assembly also defected with the Governor to the APC. Odoh who stated this in a press statement issued on Thursday ex­pressed worry that the simmering relationship between Umahi and his erstwhile People’s Democratic Party (PDP) leaders has headed for the worse, all of which, he said, had been to the detriment of the deliv­ery of some meaningful, purposeful and credible democracy dividends for the common Ebonyian.
