Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, whose country is facing a massive unprovoked invasion from neighboring Russia, has called on the European Union to grant Ukraine membership under a special procedure immediately. “Our goal is to be with all Europeans and, most importantly, to be equal. I’m sure that’s fair. I am sure we deserve it,” he said in a video speech shared on social media.“Europeans are witnessing how our soldiers are fighting not only for our country but for all of Europe, for peace, for peace for all, for all the countries of the European Union, Zelenskiy said. “Ukrainians have shown to the world who we are, while Russia has shown what it has turned into…Every crime, every shelling by the occupier only unites us more,” Zelenskiy added.

She added Ukraine’s accession would not signal that the EU wished to partition it off from Russia but would reflect a desire to fulfill the wish of many Ukrainians to join. Zelenskiy also issued an appeal to invading Russian soldiers, urging them to lay down their arms. “Abandon your equipment. Get out of here. Don’t believe your commanders. Don’t believe your propagandists. Just save your lives,” Zelenskiy said, adding that more than 4,500 Russian soldiers had already lost their lives during the Kremlin’s assault. There have been no independent confirmed casualties from either side.
