According to Fabrizio Romano, Barcelona are set to offer Chelsea defender Andreas Christensen a five-year contract this week. This comes with the central defender’s current deal at Chelsea expiring this summer, making him a free agent. It comes as little surprise to see Barcelona going for Christensen. He ticks every box that they currently need ticking, particularly the lack of transfer fee involved. The Catalan club’s financial issues are no secret, which makes it no shock to see them shopping in the free market. As things stand, Chelsea are set to lose Antonio Rudiger, Andreas Christensen and potentially Cesar Azpilicueta this summer, leaving them with 37-year-old Thiago Silva and Trevoh Chalobah as the only first-team central defenders.

If the Blues fail to bolster their defensive options, then they will, ultimately, struggle to compete next season. Factor in their lack of attacking prowess at times, too, and we could be looking at a far bigger problem. All of a sudden, it seems imperative that those at Stamford Bridge get this summer right. Securing Christensen only adds to the smart business that Barcelona have completed in recent times. For once, their seems to a direct plan, and model for the future; a future that Christensen will undoubtedly be involved in if he signs for the club. At 25, the Dane is entering what many consider to be prime years. And, with the upward trajectory that Xavi is taking Barcelona, the Chelsea defender may play a pivotal role in returning the La Liga giants to the top sooner rather than later.
