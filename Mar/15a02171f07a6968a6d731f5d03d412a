A woman identified as Esther Otoniye has been arrested by the Bayelsa State Police Command for allegedly using a hot knife to burn the buttocks of her 10-year-old stepdaughter. Otoniye, who was apprehended at their residence in the Akenfa suburb of Yenagoa, the state capital, was said to have claimed that the minor lied against her. The little girl’s body was also said to be dotted with scars suspected to have been inflicted on her by severe and repeated flogging. It was gathered on Saturday that the Commissioner of Police, Ben Okolo, ordered Otoniye’s arrest following a preponderance of complaints against her by some women and child rights groups. She, however, denied burning the primary three pupil’s buttocks with a hot knife, claiming that hot water accidentally poured on her bum. But the victim admitted to lying against her stepmother and she punished her by burning her buttocks with a hot knife. The gender desk at the state police command in charge of the case had taken the little girl to the police clinic for examination. The Police Public Relations Officer, Bayelsa Command, SP Asinim Butswat, confirmed the arrest of Esther Otoniye for the alleged crime, saying the case had been transferred to the State Criminal Investigation and Intelligence Department (SCIID). POLL He said, “It is a case where the stepmother used a hot knife to inflict bodily injuries on a 10 years old stepdaughter. The investigation is ongoing.”
