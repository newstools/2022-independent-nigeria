ABUJA – The second meeting of the zoning committee of the Peoples Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has been declared inconclusive. The committee has, however, promised to come out with acceptable position that will be beneficial to all. Addressing newsmen shortly after their meeting that lasted for more than three hours in Abuja, the chairman of the zoning committee and Benue State governor, Samuel Ortom, said that the meeting was peaceful without any tension. Ortom said: “The meeting is yet to be concluded. We have adjourned till Tuesday next week the same time, same venue. And until we conclude the proceedings, there is not much to say. So far, all the members are quite understanding. There wasn’t any form of tension.” Governor Ortom, who was flanked by Vice Chairman of the Committee, Hon. Ndudi Elumelu, and Chief Bode George and other members of the committee said, “All the members understand ourselves that zoning is very key and we are looking at it that at the end of it all, we will do something that everybody will accept and we will go ahead as one big family and win the 2023 elections.” The committee is made up of 37 members drawn from the 36 states of the federation including the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), Abuja. Recall that the issue of zoning has been causing controversy in the party. While some party members have said that the position of presidency should be zoned to the South, others, especially from the Northern extraction said that the position should be zoned to the North, because, in the 16 years of PDP in government, the South had it for 14 years while the North only had it for two years.
