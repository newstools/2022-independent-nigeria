The Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board (JAMB), on Monday, announced that with 13 days to end candidates’ registration for the 2022 Unified Tertiary Matriculation Examination (UTME) and Direct Entry (DE) it has registered 1,121,123 candidates as of Saturday, 12th March 2022. However, the Board in its weekly bulletin warned intending candidates and their parents that it cannot extend registration beyond 26th March, 2022. The Board, in a statement, explained that the time scheduled for the registration exercise from 19th February to 26th March 2022, is the only window allotted to it by relevant authorities for the conduct of the exercise. The Board explained that UTME registration dates are not fixed arbitrarily but through a consensus of opinions of the Federal Ministry of Education and examination agencies. The statement read, “Hence, before the commencement of registration or examination for any given year, all public examinations bodies are invited to a roundtable where they are expected to agree on the timetable of activities for each examination agency and which must be strictly adhered to. “The Board had sounded the alarm after noticing a drop in the number of candidates coming forward to register despite the capacity of the Board to register more daily. “The usual practice by many is to come out at the last minute thereby mounting pressure on the Board to extend. “By this announcement, the Board is urging prospective candidates who desire to register for the 2022/23 UTME/DE to come out to register as they have less than two weeks to do so as no extension would be granted after the close of registration. POLL “The general public is to note that it is practically impossible for the Board to even contemplate any extension of registration as sister examination bodies such as WAEC, NECO and NABTEB, have their allotted time which the Board cannot usurp,” the Board added in the statement.
