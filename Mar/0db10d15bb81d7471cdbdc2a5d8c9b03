Manchester City are set to announce the signing of Atletico Mineiro sensation Savinho for a fee worth €6.5 million and further add-ons, according to Fabrizio Romano. City Football Group have been believed to have completed a deal for 17-year-old Atlético Mineiro forward Savinho for a reported fee of €6.5 million in recent weeks – with a further €6 million in performance-related bonuses – after the teenager’s emergence as one of the most exciting prospects in South America. The fee could reportedly be subject to a rise owing to certain pre-established clauses by which the Brazilian outfit will receive a percentage, with ESTAC Troyes, Girona and Lommel SK previously touted as potential destinations for the Brazilian attacker. It was confirmed last week that Manchester City have struck an agreement to sign the young forward for a fee worth €6.5m (plus add-ons and sell-on fees).  Fabrizio Romano has now confirmed that Manchester City are set to announce the signing of Savinho from Atletico Mineiro after completing paperwork for a deal on Friday. POLL It was revealed in February that Manchester City were leading the race to sign Savinho – also known as Sávio – who was also being eyed by the likes of Arsenal and the Red Bull Group. Savinho became the youngest-ever player to have represented his current club in the Brazilian top-flight at just 16 years and five months of age in 2021.
