The residents of Utako village had a horrible experience on Wednesday as they fought scavengers to save their homes after the Federal Capital Territory Administration (FCTA) demolition bulldozer rammed into hundreds of illegal shanties. The scavengers, who rejected the presence of security officers at the demolition site, were observed taking various materials from their legitimate owners, who were clearly overwhelmed by the demolition’s pains. Muktar Galadima, Director of the Department of Development Control, emphasized that the clean-up effort was not just a usual operation, but a special operation to remove any illegal structures and allow the original allottees to reclaim their land. Galadima said that quit notice had been given to the squatters long ago to enable them safely relocate. The Senior Special Assistant on Monitoring, Inspection and Enforcement to FCT Minister,  Comrade Ikharo Attah said the operation was also targeted at addressing perennial traffic and criminal activities in the area. Attah who also doused the tension generated over speculation that the homes of the indigenous people within the village would be demolished, assured that only illegal structures on the land allocated to the FCT Police Command were earmarked for demolition. He also added that the cleanup exercise would help to restore the environmental sanitation and aesthetic of the Utako District. According to him,” We are only removing the illegal shanties to reclaim the land for the original allottees.  We are not demolishing the houses of indigenous people. POLL ” The clean up will also help to address the disturbing traffic gridlock and also criminal activities of miscreants in the place”.
