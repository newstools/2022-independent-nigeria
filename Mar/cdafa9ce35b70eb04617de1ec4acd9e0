Former Chelsea striker Tony Cascarino doesn’t believe that Manchester United forward Marcus Rashford would be a good fit for Arsenal. Strengthening the forward line is imperative for Mikel Arteta in the upcoming summer transfer window and it’s been reported by the Mirror that the Gunners could make an offer for the 24-year-old. But Cascarino believes that the former Manchester City assistant coach needs a player who is capable of punishing teams and argues that Rashford simply isn’t ready to do that for Arsenal. “To be a natural striker, and this is something I learned along the way and I got better at as I got older, so Marcus could become better, because there’s no reason why someone can’t improve, you have to be very, very clinical,” he said. “You have to punish because, if you’re going to a club like Arsenal, they’re looking to progress and be a Champions League team, so you have to be clinical in front of goal. “I joked and sometimes called Lacazette ‘Lack a finish’, which is a bit harsh because I think he’s a decent player, but he’s not being clinical enough for Arsenal. “They’ve needed that, for him to be punishing teams, and I don’t think Marcus is ready to do that at Arsenal.” Despite the fact that the England international possesses the tools to still have a successful future, it would be surprising to see him in an Arsenal shirt next season. POLL Rashford is currently earning £200,000 a week and given that the north Londoners have made great progress over the past year in reducing the club’s wage bill, bringing someone like him in could arguably bring detrimental long term effects to their finances. Not to mention that his signing could prevent star players Gabriel Martinelli and Emile Smith Rowe from securing regular action in the first team.
