Argentine Angel Di Maria has hinted that he will hang up his international boots after the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar. “I just wanted to say thank you for the enormous love I have received. I always dreamed of everything I’ve experienced on this beautiful night,” Di Maria said after Saturday’s win over Venezuela. “It was probably my last match with this shirt in Argentina and being able to say that it was a wonderful night is an understatement,” he added on Instagram. The 34-year-old star scored a goal in the 3-0 win over Venezuela in the World Cup qualifying match. Di Maria, who has netted 24 goals in 121 matches, also helped Argentina with its Copa America win last summer.
