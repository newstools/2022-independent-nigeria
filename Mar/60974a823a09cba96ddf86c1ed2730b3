ABAKALIKI The 64 Coordinators of Development Centers in Ebonyi State said they were dissatisfied with the judgment of the Abuja Federal High Court which sacked Governor David Umahi and his deputy, Dr. Kelechi Igwe, from office, for defecting to the All Progressives Congress (APC) from the People’s Democratic Party (PDP). The Coordinators, under the aegis of Forum of Coordinators of the Development Centre, who made their position known while briefing journalists on Tuesday, at the old State Executive Chambers, Abakaliki, said the pronouncement by Justice Inyang Ekwo on Umahi and his deputy, was surprising and shocking. Chairman of the Forum, Beatrice Eze, who spoke on behalf of the coordinators, said it was surprising and shocking that Justice Ekwo in his ruling, ordered that the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) should submit to INEC names of people who never stood for elections to be sworn-in as governor and deputy, respectively, in place of a duly elected governor and his deputy. “We call on the Appeal Court to immediately rise to protect the sanctity of our constitution by upturning Ekwo’s judgment, so as to avert the danger this judgment is capable of imposing on Nigeria’s hard-earned democracy”, the Forum added. The Forum, while expressing confidence in the impartiality of the judiciary, was upbeat that Justice Ekwo’s judgment would be reversed by the Court of Appeal. “We are confident in the impartiality of the Judiciary, the reason for which the said judgment has been appropriately appealed; again, proving that Governor Umahi is an ardent respecter of the law and legal frameworks”, the Forum noted. The Forum further said, “Governor Umahi is our Governor till 2023 as his defection to APC has not offended any portion or section of the Constitution or extant laws.” They maintained that no amount of distraction from the enemies, especially from those making futile attempts to take over the office of the Governor and his deputy, through the backdoor, would stop the accomplishment of Governor Umahi’s 2023 presidential ambition.
