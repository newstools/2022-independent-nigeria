They grabbed him by his neck from behind and indiscriminately unleashed sharp objects on his body almost, severing his right thumb. The robbers succeeded in dispossessing him of his two mobile phones including an iPhone 13 pro and Samsung Galaxy A32 series before disappearing into the waste land opposite the Phase 4 Federal Secretariat. Usigbe who was drenched in his own blood, managed to walk to the nearby police post at the Federal Secretariat where some policewomen on duty conveyed him to the State House Medical Centre for treatment. His wounds were stitched up before being discharged on Wednesday morning.
