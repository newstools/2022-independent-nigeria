As the war between Russia and Ukraine persists, the mayor of Ukraine’s capital Kyiv, former professional boxer, Vitali Klitschko has urged thousands of protesters in central London to stand with Ukraine. A huge crowd of people, including Ukrainians living in the UK, politicians and celebrities, marched through London in solidarity with Ukraine. Klitschko, speaking via video link from a military bunker, told the crowd on a big screen near Nelson’s Column in Trafalgar Square: “We defend, right now, the same principles. “Please keep together with our country, keep together with Ukraine.” London mayor Sadiq Khan has announced more than £1.1m in funding to support migrants, refugees and people seeking asylum in the UK capital, and said he was “full of admiration” for people who have offered Ukrainian refugees somewhere to stay. Ukraine’s ambassador to the UK, Vadym Prystaiko, told the crowd: “I urge you to keep up the good work, the military and humanitarian aid. “The sanctions must continue until the Russian economy has stopped in its tracks.”
