Lagos – Super Eagles Interim manager, Austin Eguavoen, has promised that the team’s technical crew will remain focused ahead of the 2022 FIFA World Cup between Nigeria and Ghana with the first leg in Kumasi, Ghana next Friday 25 March. Eguavoen, who spoke in a radio sport programme monitored in Lagos, said that it was an uphill task leading the Nigerian national team. “We will remain focused but our only appeal is not to discourage us but encourage and support us. I am focused and I know I have a lot of fans out there, and we’ll celebrate together after the two-legged games,” Eguavoen stated. Eguavoen, who said that Nigerians were understandably demanding and do not settle for less, urged fans to encourage and not discourage those in charge of the national team. “It’s very tough. Very tough because we are humans and are very demanding. And we are a football nation, which is normal. We don’t want to settle for less. We always want to go for the best and by so doing, we want to win every trophy available. “To be saddled with that responsibility I think is a very tough one. There’ll be critics everywhere, left, right and centre definitely but the ability to be able to hold on and shed most things away and remain focused determines a lot.” Recall that CAF has given Ghana strict conditions for use of the Baba Yara Stadium for the first leg of the 2022 FIFA World Cup qualifying playoff. POLL However, if the conditions are not met, the match will still be played at the stadium, but Ghana FA will suffer unstated financial penalties. The decision to relocate the match to Kumasi was sequel to the inspection of CAF team, which found the initial venue, Cape Coast stadium unworthy of hosting the match.
