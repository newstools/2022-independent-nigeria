A group of Afghans were war weary after fleeing a 20-year conflict in their home country, yet despite their own traumas, they were horrified by a single photograph of four people, including two children, lying dead on the ground in Kyiv. Now in Poland, they were spurred into action by helping Ukrainian refugees with whom they identify. Sabur Dawod Zai, 27, is drawing on a wealth of experience after two decades of invasion, occupation, civil war and displacement. “We had the same situation. I escaped from Afghanistan with a single bag and left behind everything: education, stability, career and families. The photo of four [victims] and other scenes of destruction should make everyone think like a human. That’s why I decided to help,” Mr Sabur told The National from his new home in the Polish capital city of Warsaw.
