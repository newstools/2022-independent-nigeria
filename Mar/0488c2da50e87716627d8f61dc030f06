ABUJA  – Deji Adeyanju, a human rights activist, has called on presi­dential aspirants under the platform of the Peoples Dem­ocratic Party (PDP) to close their ranks and present Peter Obi as the party’s flag bearer. He also asked all the pres­idential aspirants who had declared interest under the party such as Governor Nye­som Wike, Bala Mohammed, Emmanuel Udom, Aminu Tambuwal, and others to step down for Obi in 2023. He disclosed this on Mon­day in an open letter to the governors, noting that Obi has what it takes to get PDP back into power and that his campaign would require little funding. Adeyanju warned that PDP would remain in oppo­sition for another eight years and go into extinction if it failed to produce a formida­ble presidential candidate in 2023. According to the letter, “With the recent signing of the Electoral Act into law, there has been a flurry of political activities geared to­wards the 2023 presidential election. Naturally, several po­litical actors within the Peo­ple’s Democratic Party have shown interest to vie for the office of the president of the Federal Republic of Nigeria. “However, I have noticed with dismay that rather than close ranks, some governors of the PDP stock have en­gaged in a ‘fight to finish’. Sadly, there seems to be no voice of reason to call the governors to order. It should be noted that if the PDP fails to produce a candidate that will resonate with the average Nigerian, the party may find itself out of power for anoth­er 8 years, with the attendant consequence of becoming a mushroom party and subse­quent extinction.
