Mike Maignan and Fikayo Tomori refused to ignore the racist abuse they suffered at the hands of some Cagliari fans in Milan’s 1-0 win yesterday. A brawl erupted after the final whistle of the Rossoneri’s victory yesterday, when the pair were the target of racist insults and chants by a section of the home support. Maignan brought his hand to his ear in defiance, mocking the ultras and urging them to continue their abuse. Milan confirmed after the match that Maignan and Tomori had suffered racist abuse, saying: “This Serie A matchday was dedicated to the stand against racism, but there’s still a long road ahead and we must keep on fighting together.” Maignan continued to express his anger after the match, posting a photo of a monkey smoking a cigarette giving the middle finger alongside one of him and Tomori, accompanied by the caption N.W.A. This is not the first time that some Cagliari fans have racially abused players at their stadium, with previous examples involving Juventus’ Moise Kean and Romelu Lukaku during his time at Inter.
