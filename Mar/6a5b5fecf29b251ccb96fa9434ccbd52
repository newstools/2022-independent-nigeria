Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Tuesday signed a decree on criminal liability for cooperation with Russia, reported Nexta TV. The decree states that “cooperation with the aggressor state” would entail punishment of up to 15 years in prison. Zelenskyy has signed several decrees since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine on February 24 one declaring state of emergency, another ordering general mobilisation, and one last week recalling Ukrainian peacekeepers to defend the country. Meanwhile, the fight for Kyiv has intensified with Russian forces unleashing a fresh wave of bombings and shellings in the capital as the war in Ukraine entered the 20th day. Russian President Vladimir Putin calls Russia’s actions in Ukraine a “special military operation” to “denazify” the country, a claim that Ukraine and its allies reject as a pretext for an unjustified and illegal attack.
