KANO – Frontline Social Democratic Party (SDP) presidential hopeful, Barrister Adewale Adebayo on Thursday boasted that he would overrun the likes of Atiku Abubakar, and Asiwaju Ahmed Bola Tinubu in the event that they emerge as standard-bearers of their respective parties in the forthcoming election. Barrister Adewale, who spoke in Kano at the end of a two-day campaign tour to the ancient city of Kano said, the two prominent politicians no longer have the attraction and bite to win a competitive election. The soft-spoken Presidential hopeful noted that Atiku and Tinubu’s forays into the political turf have exposed their weaknesses and that he would not lose sleep over the duo if they are fortunate to pick the ticket of their political platforms. Adewale, who described his outing as a call to service, promised to overhaul the entire system to make it more accountable and responsible to the citizens. Adewale said: “I will do everything differently from what’s obtainable now because we have to make the system responsible to the people to fast track our progress. He assured that terrorism, banditry and all form of crimes would be fought to a standstill, adding that a situation where those in positions of authority appeared to have relinquished power to non-state actors was not only “unacceptable, but highly irresponsible “. As an elected President, “I will lead the way, chart the way forward and give direction on s steady march to nationhood, and will not compromise on state matters.” He said, “I’ve seen ordinary citizens sacrifice on the streets and their sacrifices have motivated us to do more in our collective responsibility to rediscover lost ground.” POLL While in Kano, Barrister Adewale met with the emir of Kano, Alhaji Aminu Ado Bayero in his palace, and capped it up with a townhall meeting with stakeholders on Wednesday.
