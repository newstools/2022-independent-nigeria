P/HARCOURT – For overturning the demands by the Nigerian women to pass the gender equality bill, the National Assembly has come under attack by women from other African countries and their counterparts in the United Arab Emirates. The women who met in Dubai, frowned at the nation’s lawmaking body arm of government and expressed disappointment that as the most populous black country in the world, Nigeria should show good example by doing things that other African countries that look up to its leadership role could emulate, warning that no country can develop effective without the contributions of women. It would be recalled that of the five items on the women gender equality bill, the National Assembly chose to rescind from its earlier decision of out-right rejection of the gender equality opportunity bill and has promised to have a second look at three of the items in the bill. The women who gathered in Dubai, United Arab Emirate for the AfroZons Soundoff global music fiesta organized by the Dubai Department of Economy and Tourism, called on the Nigerian government to prevail on the National Assembly to pass the bill thereby creating socio-economic and political opportunities for Nigerian women.
