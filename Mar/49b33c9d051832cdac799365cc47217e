Brentford defender Rico Henry has ended speculation over his future by signing a new long-term contract at the club. The left-back was due to be entering the final 12 months of his deal this summer and had been linked with a number of other Premier League clubs. However, the 24-year-old has now signed a new deal which runs until the summer of 2026, with the club holding the option of a further year extension beyond that. Henry, who signed for the Bees from Walsall in 2016, was a key part of the sides that reached back-to-back Championship playoff finals, earning promotion to the Premier League for the first time in the club’s history in the second of them last year. He has impressed stepping into the top flight, making 26 appearances so far this season. “I am very pleased that Rico has signed another contract with us,” manager Thomas Frank told the club’s website. “He has had a top time here. He has been here a long time and we are pleased that he wants to continue to grow with us. “Rico has seamlessly made the step up to the Premier League. Defensively he is fantastic, and you can see the way he defends one on one against some great attackers. He is also contributing up the field with the way he can arrive in the penalty area, as we have seen this season. There are bits to work on, but it is great that he will continue that development with us. “We are pleased that we have a player here that can develop in to a good Premier League player. He can also be part of our development as a club. We are constantly aiming to be better. We think we can get to a higher level and think we can take Rico to a higher level as well. It is very good to have him here.”
