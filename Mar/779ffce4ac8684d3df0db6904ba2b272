In the social firmament of Lagos, one name you cannot simply dismiss with a wave of the hand is that of Lagos super big boy and top socialite, Chief Adebola Dosunmu, the Akinsiku of Lagos (Olori Eyo), who is the custodian of Lago’s most popular cultural festival, the Adamu Orisa, popularly known as Eyo. But that should be stale news by now. What is, however, making the rounds now in many social circles in the Centre of Excellence State is that the widely-connected Akinsiku, the blossom ally of Oba Saheed Elegushi, will be turning 50 in a matter of days. Trust the jolly good fellow as plans are already at feverish points by the birthday boy and his pals to make the anniversary a grand one. A grand ball event is being planned as part of the birthday celebration. King of Fuji music, Wasiu Ayinde will lead other stars such as Davido, Naira Marley, Lil Kesh to what promises to be an evening of festivities. The real estate mogul and socialite said he is grateful to God for all he has been through in life and it is worth celebrating the landmark age of 50. Chief Adebola Dosunmu, who is married to another prominent Lagos indigene, Abimbola Ashake Dosunmu, and blessed with six children, is the chairman and chief executive of Utica Homes, a real estate company, which has developed over 10 housing estates within the Victoria Island and Eti-Osa corridor.
