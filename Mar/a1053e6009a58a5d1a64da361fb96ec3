LAGOS – Shooting Stars Sports Club (3SC) of Ibadan have been berated and accused of trying to undermine the Nigeria Professional Football League (NPFL) after the Oluyole Warriors initially sacked 17 players, a decision they later rescinded following a public outcry. The Oluyole Warriors, who are winless in their last five league games, are three points above the relegation zone, having recorded just 20 points from 17 matches as at the time of this report, took the decision which jolted the Nigerian football public. The players that were reportedly asked to leave the club but were reinstated are Tambe Charles, Anas Mohammed, Abubakar Adeyemi, Anene Francis, Egorde Oghenetega, Ebenezer Odeyemi, Wasiu Alalade, Kola Daniel, Yusuf Habeeb, Olumide Henry and Kehinde Adedipe. Others are Olasunkanmi Quadry, Amusan Taiye, Adelani Seun, Onwubuche Chimankpa, Wellington Ehiabhi and Meshack Amos. But the club management rescinded the decision after an uproar from their fans. One of the players, who spoke to our correspondent on condition of anonymity, said the once famous club was dragging the Nigerian topflight to disreputa after that unpopular decision. “It was very unfortunate that they took that decision. “It is a way of dragging our league backward and in the mud because I don’t understand how a club will just wake up and decided to sack 17 players. POLL “If we have a league, this club must be punished because such thing is not done anywhere around the world. “As for me, I know they relaxed the decision because people cried out; it is not really a decision taking seriously so I am on the lookout. “It now shows that we are not presently secured as players of the club right now after all our sacrifices to get 3SC promoted,” the player lamented.
