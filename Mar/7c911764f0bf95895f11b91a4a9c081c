ABUJA – Some Christian clerics of the Northern ex­traction have held a special prayer rally for the National Leader of the All Progressives Congress (APC) and 2023 presidential hopeful, Asiwaju Ahmed Bola Tinubu, at the Unity Fountain, Abuja. The clerics, under the aegis of Northern Clergy and Chris­tian for Tinubu 2023, said the decision to pray for the presi­dential ambition of the former Lagos State governor was in­formed by the Holy Spirit. The clergies offered prayers for the will of God for Senator Tinubu’s presidential ambi­tion to come to fruition at the rally which was well-attended by their followers. Speaking to journalists shortly after the one-million man prayer rally, the conve­ner, Bishop Sunday Garuba, said God expressed it in their hearts to pray for Tinubu’s presidential ambition. According to Bishop Garuba, “It is in our culture as an organisation to always pray and to intercede for this great nation. Just like I said in my speech, since 2015, God has been using us as an organisation to pray for this great country for good gover­nance that God will choose the right people to lead this nation. “And looking into that as we went to prayers, God ex­pressed in our hearts to pray and to intercede. And we are praying, God also expressed in our hearts to pray for Sen­ator Ahmed Tinubu because of his track records of how he had led. “He is one man that has led before as the Governor of La­gos State. And for his wisdom and his ability as a man, he is not a tribalistic man. And also at the same time, he is not bi­ased in his religious affiliation. “That prompted our hearts to pray and to call on God so that God will give us the right leader to lead this nation,” he added.
