Justin Dean, husband to the Nigerian dancer and Instagram influencer, Korra Obidi has apologised to her family, expressing that his wife is not a chronic cheat as he claimed. Recall that Dean accused Obidi who recently gave birth to a baby girl of cheating in their marriage, expressing that he has been trying to save their marriage since 2018. However, in a video which has now being deleted on his Instagram page, he stated that his claims were inaccurate. His caption on the video read, “This is my apology to the Obidi family about chronic cheating claims. @korraobidi @nancyumeh and her dad (papa). June and Athena are my children and I love them. I’lol be there for them even if I am not married to Korra.”
