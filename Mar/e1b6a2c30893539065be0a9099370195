Wesley Fofana is set to make his first appearance of the season as Leicester look to extend their European adventure at Rennes on Thursday night. The defender has not played since breaking a leg and damaging ankle ligaments in a pre-season friendly against Villarreal last summer and was unable to feature in last week’s first leg after catching Covid-19. But Leicester boss Brendan Rodgers confirmed Fofana would travel to France, with Leicester hoping their 2-0 win at King Power Stadium last Thursday will help them advance to the quarter-finals of the Europa Conference League. ‘Wesley will come into the squad and hopefully he will be able to play some part,’ said Rodgers. ‘I’ve been so impressed with him, his intensity to get back, his drive and determination. We have to manage that. They want to play every minute of every game. ‘He will have a big contribution to make but we have to tread carefully, and get him through to the end of the season, and then get a good pre-season, and then back to that high level. ‘He gained on his physicality, he’s filled out and done a lot of work off the field. That experience and that little bit of frustration of not playing will give him even more determination. ‘I’ve worked with lots of top young players and he’s on that path. We just need to be careful with him and I’ve no doubt he will get back to an even greater level than before.’
