Facing an uphill battle to end a four-game losing streak in the Premier League, Brighton & Hove Albion welcome Liverpool to the Amex Stadium at lunchtime. The Seagulls lost 2-1 to Newcastle United last Tuesday, while Liverpool sealed their Champions League quarter-finals spot midweek. Brighton have lost their grip on a top-half spot after a dismal run of results and could not stop the Newcastle United juggernaut at St James’ Park, with Ryan Fraser and Fabian Schar netting before Lewis Dunk’s consolation in a 2-1 defeat. Mixed Feelings As United Host Spurs Ranger Coach Charges PlayersOn Adopted Home Ground Brighton have also picked up just one win from their last 10 Premier League matches at the Amex since the start of October – taking just two points from the last 12 on offer at home and scoring a mere 10 goals on familiar territory all season – and Liverpool are in no mood to let up. Indeed, a 1-0 win over West Ham United last Saturday marked Liverpool’s seventh win on the bounce in the Premier League, although they remain six points behind leaders Manchester City with a game in hand, and every game is now a cup final for the quadruple-chasing visitors. Liverpool have concede a mere two goals in the process, while scoring 19, although they have failed to win any of their last three against Brighton, who managed to rescue a 2-2 draw at Anfield earlier this seaon. Brighton boss Potter says Adam Webster will likely remain out injured until after the international break, with the centre-back still struggling to overcome a groin injury. Enock Mwepu and Jeremy Sarmiento are stepping up their recoveries from thigh issues and are in contention to feature this weekend, and Potter did not report any fresh concerns from the Newcastle defeat.
