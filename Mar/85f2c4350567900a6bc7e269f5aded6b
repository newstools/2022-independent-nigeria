Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky announced during a televised address on Wednesday that nearly 6,000 Russian soldiers have been killed since the start of the invasion. “Think of this number: almost 6,000 Russians died. Russian military. In six days of war,” Zelensky noted in his speech. “This is without counting the losses of the enemy last night. Six thousand. To get what? Get Ukraine? It is impossible.” Zelensky also encouraged Ukrainians to keep fighting. Ukraine Foreign Minister Says South Korea Will Take Active Part… U.N.

And for the war against us there will be an International Tribunal for them,” he said. “My dears, the time will come when we will be able to sleep. But it will be after the war, after the victory in a peaceful country, as we need.” “I ask all of you to take care of your loved ones. Take care of your brothers in arms. I admire you. The whole world admires you,” he continued. Today, you, Ukrainians, are a symbol of invincibility. A symbol that people in any country can become the best people on earth at any moment. Glory to Ukraine!” Observers said they could not immediately verify Zelensky’s claim of Russian casualties. Russia, meanwhile, claimed on Wednesday that it was successful in taking its first major city in Ukraine, Kherson, nearly a week after its forces invaded. “Negotiations are ongoing between the Russian command, the administration of the city and the region to address issues of maintaining the functioning of social infrastructure facilities, ensuring law and order and the safety of the population,” the Russian Defense Ministry said in a statement regarding the southern Ukrainian city. POLL A military adviser to Zelensky, however, denied the reports and said that the battle for Kherson is ongoing.
