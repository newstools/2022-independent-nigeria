The British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC), has apologized to the former private secretary of Princess Diana after an inquiry found that the news organization covered up “deceitful behavior” used by Martin Bashir to get his famous 1995 interview with the Princess of Wales. The news organization will be paying Patrick Jephson damages in a settlement for the incident, The Guardian reported. “The BBC apologizes unreservedly to Commander Jephson for the harm caused to him and has paid his legal costs. The BBC has also paid Commander Jephson a substantial sum in damages, which he intends to donate in full to British charities nominated by him,” BBC stated in a statement. SOURCE: NEWSWEEK
