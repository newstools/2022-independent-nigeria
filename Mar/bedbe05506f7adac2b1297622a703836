Association of Power Generation Companies (APGC), has faulted claims that it intends to keep the country in darkness except federal government paid N1.6 trillion debts. Dr. Joy Ogaji, Executive secretary of the association, disclosed this in Abuja. She also punctured claims by the Nigerian Bulk Electricity Trading Company Plc, NBET that only five Gencos have active power purchase agreements, (PPAs). He described such claim as a serious threat to the Nigerian Electricity Supply Industry, (NESI). She added: “The fact that NBET claims that they have only five active PPAs entails that most of the power plants do not have power purchase agreements (PPAs). “This situation is a scary scenario for any investor as no guarantee of any sort is in place to assure any form of return on investments” She said that the absence of Power Purchase Agreements, PPAs as claimed by the Nigerian Bulk Electricity Trading Company Plc, NBET entails that Gencos are exposed to the vagaries in the downstream electricity market.
