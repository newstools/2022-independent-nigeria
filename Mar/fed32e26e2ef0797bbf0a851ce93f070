Russian President Vladimir Putin on Sunday welcomed the idea to hold a trilateral meeting of the IAEA, Russia and Ukraine as “useful” and said it could be held by video link or in a third country, amidst growing global concern over the safety of the nuclear power plants in war-torn Ukraine. Russia’s armed forces earlier seized control of the Zaporozhskaya and Chernobyl nuclear power stations during a “special military operation” in Ukraine. Russia says its invasion of Ukraine by land, air and sea is a special military operation, which President Putin claims, without any evidence, is needed to demilitarise and denazify the neighbouring country.

During the telephone conversation between Macron and Putin, the French president voiced his concern about the situation with nuclear power plants in Ukraine.
