Less than 24 hours after the Abuja-Kaduna train was attacked by bandits in Kaduna State, gunmen on Tuesday once again attacked the train station in the state. This time around, the bandits attacked the Gidan Train Station along the Abuja-Kaduna rail track. Though, the level of the attack on the train station was still sketchy as at the time of filing this report, but Mr. Segun Esan, the Secretary General of the Nigerian Union of Railway Men (NUR), confirmed the attack on the train station to our correspondent via a text message. He said: ‘Yes. Very through.” Esan, however, could not give the details of the attack as he said he was in a meeting.
