LAFIA – In the aftermath of the All Progressives Congress (APC) National Convention, there is a palpable cold war among the party members in Nasarawa State as governor Abdullahi Sule, on Thursday sued for calm amongst the ruling All Progress Congress (APC), members in the state. The Governor’s call was contained in a statement signed by his Chief Press Secretary Ibrahim Addra and available to newsmen in Lafia, the State capital. The statement said that the governor has observed with concern recent unsavoury outbursts, bickerings, bitter exchanges and sometimes use of foul and unprintable language between supporters of prominent sons and political gladiators in the state following the outcome of the just concluded APC National Convention. The read,” This development is not only detestable but signifies retrogressive politicking; the kind that divides and retards progress,” Governor Sule said. He adds that “The outpour of emotions at such moments is understandable but must be tamed in order to ensure harmony, peaceful coexistence and growth of our party, the APC and the state in particular”. He notes that Praiseworthy and instructive is that as politicians and devout Muslims, their Excellencies and Distinguished Senators Abdullahi Adamu and Umaru Tanko Almakura have since accepted the outcome of the election as the will of Allah. “It is on record that Senator Umaru Tanko Al-Makura has gone to the residence of Senator Abdullahi Adamu to congratulate him on his victory, promising to support him to achieve victory for the party in the forthcoming general elections in 2023. Sule, appeal for calm especially if we profess true love and support for these two elder statesmen; saying “we should emulate them by making peace instead of bitter rivalry which is an ill wind that blows no one any good”. POLL Governor Sule urges that citizens do everything within their powers to remain peaceful and avoid actions that will portray Nasarawa to the rest of the country as being unable to manage their victory.
