Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky posted a video on Tuesday morning, telling his people: “We will overcome.” In the clip shared on his Instagram page, the country’s leader is seen standing on the snowy streets of the capital, Kyiv. “Snow has fallen. Such a spring. What a war, such a spring, sad… but everything will be fine. We will overcome everything,” he said, as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine entered a 13th day.

Zelensky’s defiant video messages have earned him praise in Ukraine and across the world. In a video shared on Monday night, Zelensky vowed to beat back Russia’s forces and rebuild Ukraine. “I’m not hiding,” he said in the video, the first film in his presidential office in Kyiv since the start of Russia’s invasion. He also vowed to remain in the capital despite reportedly surviving numerous assassination attempts in recent days. POLL His message Tuesday came as a new effort to evacuate civilians along safe corridors got underway. Videos posted by the Ukrainian state communications agency showed buses packed with people were seen fleeing the shelling in the eastern city of Sumy. But it was not clear how long the effort would last, as previous attempts to get civilians to safety have been abandoned with renewed attacks. “We have already started the evacuation of civilians from Sumy to Poltava, including foreign students,” the agency said in a tweet. “We call on Russia to agree on other humanitarian corridors in Ukraine.”
