While there has been a lot of focus on Barcelona’s pursuit of Borussia Dortmund superstar Erling Haaland, the Catalans, at the same time, are continuing to keep tabs on exciting youngsters within Spain, Europe and across the globe to add to their ranks. Barça have secured the signing of one such talent in Pablo Torre and have been pushing to sign Brazilian wonderkid Endrick from Palmeiras. Now, Mundo Deportivo reports that Barcelona also have their eyes on exciting Real Sociedad striker Jon Karrikaburu. The 19-year-old forward has been on the club’s radar since last year, with Jon Andoni Goikoetxea, a scout for the Catalans, keeping a close watch on his development at the Basque outfit for a while now. Karrikaburu is a product of La Real’s youth setup and has made just one senior appearance to date. However, he has impressed with the club’s B team, having netted 14 goals and set up two more from 37 appearances to date. The youngster’s impressive track record in youth football and his performances for the B team have attracted a lot of eyeballs. It prompted Real Sociedad to hand the teenager a new long-term contract last year, extending his stay at the Anoeta until the summer of 2026. The La Liga outfit also inserted a €60 million release clause in Karrikaburu’s new contract, ensuring that any club interested in signing him will have to make a significant financial investment. Along with Karrikaburu, Barcelona are also keeping tabs on another Real Sociedad youngster in the form of 20-year-old midfielder Benat Turrientes, who happens to have a release clause worth €50 million. POLL Barça have enjoyed a lot of joy by putting their faith in youngsters like Ansu Fati, Pedri, Gavi and Nico Gonzalez, among others, in the recent past. So, it does not come as a surprise that they continue to scour the market for talented prospects. However, a move for Karrikaburu will be complicated his lengthy contract and the sizable release clause of €60 million.
