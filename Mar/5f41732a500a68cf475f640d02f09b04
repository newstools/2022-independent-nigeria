BAUCHI – The leadership of the All Progressives Congress (APC) and all the organizers of the convention of the party have been called upon to ensure that no contestant feel intimidated during and after the convention. This was contained in a press statement signed by a Bauchi gubernatorial Aspirant Alameen Sani Muhammad, a copy which was made available to Daily Independent in Bauchi. Alameen said that leaders of the party should provide an enabling environment for all contestants to thrive, stressing that they must not loose sight of the fact that the convention is a litmus test of the expectation of the outcome of the forth coming 2023 general elections, hence, everyone should be carried along. The Gubernatorial Aspirant called on all the contestants of various positions of the party, particularly the executives to be orderly and law abiding during the conduct of the convention just as he urged those who will emerge victorious to be magnanimous in victory and run an inclusive governance, so nobody will feel aggrieved. “Let the looser be good losers who will accept defeat in good fate, knowing that in all healthy and fair contests, there must be winners and losers.They must bear in mind that the indices to success are fairness and justice, but doing otherwise will not augur well for the party at this critical moment. “It is my prayer that the convention will produce people of integrity, hardwork and loyalty as this will ultimately be the umpires that will produce true leaders who have the nation at heart, those who will consider the predicament of the poor man and address the quagmire of the nation. “It is my expectation that the leaders who will emerge after the convention will confront head-on, the challenge of insecurity bedeviling our Nation.Leaders that will address the root of poverty, economic hardship and, corruption and social contempt that has eaten deep into the fabrics of the nation” ” Our country needs selfless leaders that will sack and replace these brazen thieves that has perpetrated corruption in high places, those who perfected nepotism and favouritism in governance. Our country is at the brink of collapse and we need leaders that will salvage it. We must know that Nigerians are no longer Nigerians of those days who were gullible. We have more enlightened masses than ever before to send parking, all these vagabonds in government, hence we must all all wake up” Alameen said
