In recognition of its outstanding efforts in girl-child development, women empowerment and job creation under its 5by20 programme, the Coca-Cola System in Nigeria has received the ‘Job Creation Champion’ award from the Lagos State Employment Trust Fund (LSETF) at the Fund’s 5th Anniversary Gala and Awards Night which held on Friday, March 4 2022, in Lagos State. Chairman, LSETF, Bola Adesola, while conferring the honour on Coca-Cola at the Awards Night on Friday, commended the Coca-Cola System (comprising Coca- Cola Nigeria and Nigerian Bottling Company) for sharing in the goal of the Fund, which led to improving the learning outcomes and economic status of 18,000 marginalized adolescent girls in Nigeria aged 16-19 under its Educating Nigerian Girls in New Enterprise (ENGINE), implemented by Mercy Corps, a global Humanitarian agency, in a partnership intervention with UK Department for International Development (DFID). LSETF is proud to have been part of this journey, as well as the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with Coca-Cola and Nigerian Bottling Company under its 5 by 20 initiative aimed at empowering over 1,000 women in the State. The MoU, executed in 2018, was a framework where select women across the state received training in financial literacy and business skills, as well as startup capital to integrate them into the Coca-Cola value chain as retailers of the company’s beverage products.
