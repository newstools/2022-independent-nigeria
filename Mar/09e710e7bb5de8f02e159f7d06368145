As the Nigerian music industry continues to evolve, the music space has begun to experience a surge in the number of up-and-coming artistes who have expressed their enthusiasm in making a name for themselves as well as fulfilling their dreams of being on the big stages. Born Obodoruku O g h e n e g u e k e , ‘Gueke’ is one of those artistes ready to take the world by storm and carve a niche for himself in the industry and move his career to a new level. While speaking in an interview, the singer said that he is prepared to launch into the music industry with his unique voice and style to warm his way into the hearts of music lovers. Gueke, who nursed a passion for music from a tender age attributed his success so far to his roots as a church instrumentalist as early as age eight, which set him in line for the journey into the music industry. He revealed that owing to the experiences and knowledge gathered so far, he has what it takes to build a thriving career in music, adding that it only takes someone who has gone through the training process and has mastered the rudiments of music to be able to successfully remain relevant in the industry. The singer came into the spotlight with the release of his debut single ‘Komaroll’ in November 2019 and has continuously worked towards remaining relevant. With the recent launch of his new piece, ‘Attitude’ released in February 2022, Gueke seems to have made up his mind to set the pace for others to follow. “I am enthusiastic about my decision to journey into music, I am very determined to make my name known both home and abroad, I’m also ready for whatever challenges may come because it is always a part of the process and in order to succeed, I’m ready to do what it takes to achieve my goals,” he said.
