The Indigenous People of Biafra, IPOB has reiterated their loyalty to its Nnamdi Kanu who they claim remains the ‘the indefatigable and indomitable liberator’, stressing that anyone parading himself as the new leader of the group was an impostor and a fraud. In a statement signed by its spokesman, Emma Powerful, the separatist group stated that Kanu’s leadership role was divinely orchestrated. Powerful said, “We the Indigenous People of Biafra wish to unequivocally state that we have one and only one leader and he is the indefatigable and indomitable liberator of our time, Mazi Nnamdi Kanu. Anybody claiming to be a new leader of IPOB is not only an impostor but also a fraud and should be disregarded and discarded into a waste bin. “To lead this great IPOB family is neither by talking nor is it by the personal wish of any individual, it is rather a heavenly mandated calling and CHUKWUOKIKEABIAMA chose Kanu to lead his children out of bondage into freedom. “Anybody being fronted by the Nigerian DSS to parade him/herself as IPOB’s new leader is simply embarking on a self-destructive venture. “IPOB has no other leader than our supreme leader KANU. Irrespective of where he is today, he remains our Supreme leader and founder of IPOB worldwide, and IPOB is united and intact under his Command. The DOS, which is the highest institutional Structure set up by our leader Kanu, is coordinating the affairs of IPOB and is completely loyal to Mazi Nnamdi Kanu so nobody should contemplate creating issues where non exist.”
