JOS – The Director General and Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of the Industrial Training Fund (ITF), Joseph Ari, has called on members of the general public to disregard campaign posters currently in circulation in Jos to the effect that he is vying for a senatorial seat at the 2023 general elections. Ari, who stated this on Saturday at a press conference in Jos, said it has come to his notice that some faceless elements in their desperate attempts have printed campaign posters attributing them to him. He explained that he is not interested in contesting for any elective position, or in support of the ambition of any Aspirant during the upcoming APC convention Abuja. He described the development as false, unfounded and not deserving of any attention. According to him, these elements who are hell-bent on pulling him down wanted to flood the APC National Convention venue in Abuja with these posters in order to breed mistrust and disharmony, thereby generating rancour for their own selfish purposes. The DG further said he has never contemplated vying for any elective position in the nearest future stressing that he has alerted the security agencies of the development with a view to arresting these elements who are bent to course confusion in the state. “I am presently busy and fully engaged with the onerous responsibility of deploying the mandate of the ITF to equip Nigerians with skills for employability and entrepreneurship”. According to Ari, under his leadership, the ITF has been at the forefront of instilling in Nigerians the need for the country, like other developed nations of the world, to embrace Technical and Vocational Education and Training (TVET) as a real alternative to paper qualification and white-collar jobs.
