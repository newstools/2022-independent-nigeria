Chelsea’s scheduled Champions League knockout stage meeting with Lille has been plunged into serious doubt after Roman Abramovich was sanctioned by the European Union on Tuesday, according to reports. The 55-year-old oligarch, who has owned the Blues since 2003, was previously hit with a number of UK government sanctions in the wake of Russia’s ongoing invasion of Ukraine. Abramovich was hit with fresh sanctions by the EU on Tuesday along with 14 other individuals, including the likes of Konstantin Ernst, who is the chief executive of Russia’s Channel One. The new restrictions have the potential to threaten the status of Wednesday’s second-leg knockout stage match between Chelsea and Lille in the Champions League, according to L’Equipe.
