Otubu noted that the energy currently supplied to the DisCos no longer meets the demand of its consumers, and the company has had to carry out load shedding to give the inhabitants of the state. He added that the agreement with the NDPHC will provide an alternative source for improving the power supply to DisCo’s customers. He explained that the agreement will enable the company to increase power supply to the tertiary institutions within its network, including the University of Lagos (UNILAG), College of Medicine at Idi-Araba, and Lagos State University (LASU). Engr. Chiedu Ugbo, the MD/ CEO of the Niger Delta Power Holding Company, commended EKEDC for its efforts towards finalizing the agreement.
