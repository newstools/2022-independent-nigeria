LAGOS  – Nesto Aviation Services Limited (NestAv), the aviation arm of the Obijackson Group has unveiled plans to increase its market share as a charter operator and also expand its fleet of helicopters and jets services. Mr. Ehis Uadiale, the General Manager, NestAv, told journalists in an online chat that the oil and gas sector was faced with some challenges, which had affected its growth in recent times, but reiterated the determination of the company to surmount these. Uadiale disclosed that the company, which was incorporated in 2013, was focused on consolidating its business plans and called for a consolidation of airline operators in the industry to enable capacity building in delivering premium value to its target market. He emphasised that the consolidation or strategic alliances would save both the industry and the clients as this would ensure the eradication of scheduled flight operators’ inability to airlift passengers at promised frequencies and completely eradicate cancellations. He said: “We need to have consolidated efforts in the industry where people with the same business idea, come together to achieve the required capacity to ensure operators deliver on promised frequencies without fail.” On the maintenance of NestAv’s fleet, which consists of two AW139 helicopters, one Bombardier Global Express jet and a Gulf Stream G-IV, Uadiale explained that the company maintains its rotary wings (helicopters) through a self-sustained maintenance organisation in the country. Besides, he said NestAv has an agreement with the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM), which entails following a defined maintenance programme to aid the in-house maintenance and repairs when an aircraft is unserviceable or requires routine scheduled maintenance. For the fixed wings operations, Uadiale pointed out that there is limited capabilities to service and maintain these aircraft in the country, stressing that the company schedules annual shadow maintenance outside Nigeria with an approved Aircraft Maintenance Organisation (AMO), in order to ensure adequate checks on fleet.
