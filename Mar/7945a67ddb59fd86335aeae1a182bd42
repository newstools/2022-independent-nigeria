Cristiano Ronaldo has been ruled out of Sunday’s Manchester derby through injury. It’s understood that Edinson Cavani is also not part of the match-day squad for the game at the Etihad Stadium. That leaves interim United manager Ralf Rangnick with only Marcus Rashford as a recognised centre-forward, with attacking midfielder Bruno Fernandes also an option as false nine.

Only one of those goals, however, has come in 2022. In his last 10 matches, Ronaldo has scored just once — a well-taken effort from distance in the 2-0 home win over Brighton & Hove Albion on February 15. Rangnick’s United, despite sitting fourth in the Premier League, have scored only 17 goals in their last 12 matches. Last month, Rangnick admitted Ronaldo “should score more goals” but added “it is not only an issue with Cristiano, it’s also an issue with all the other players”. The only previous Premier League game Ronaldo has missed this season was United’s 2-2 draw to Aston Villa on January 15, due to a hip issue. When asked again about Ronaldo’s struggles in front of goal this year, Rangnick said on Friday: POLL “A few things that have happened in the last couple of months that couldn’t have been foreseen by anybody.” Rangnick, who will be taking charge of his first Manchester derby, also spoke positively about England international Rashford, another forward option. Rashford has not scored since the 1-0 win over West Ham United on January 22 but Rangnick insisted the 24-year-old has “abundant talent”. “I will put all my energy into that, to help him to take the same pathway that other players did in the last three months,” Rangnick added.
