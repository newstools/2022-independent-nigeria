“UEFA has decided to end its partnership with Gazprom in all competitions. The decision takes immediate effect and covers all existing agreements, including the Champions League, European national team competitions and Euro2024”. Gazprom, the world’s largest exporter of natural gas, whose majority share capital is held by the Russian state, was one of UEFA’s main sponsors in an agreement that began a decade ago in 2012.
