Terrorists who stormed the Agunu Dutse community, in Kachia Local Government Area of Kaduna State have kidnapped Fifty-seven (57) persons while one sustained a gunshot injury. Daily Post reports that a resident of the area, Philip John, disclosed that the terrorists stormed the community on foot in the early hours of Thursday, at about 1 am. He explained that the terrorists came to the community in large numbers and started shooting sporadically to put fear in the hearts of the natives. According to him, the affected community is very close to the Akada barracks, about two kilometers away. He explained, “The victims included 16 men, nine children, and 32 women. The villagers could not repel them because of the kind of sophisticated weapons they were using and had to run away for their lives.” Philip John explained that the terrorists are yet to establish any contact with the relatives of the victims. Meanwhile, ASP Mohammed Jalige, the State Police Public Relations Officer, is yet to confirm the incident.
