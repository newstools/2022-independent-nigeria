American photo and video sharing social networking service, Instagram on Wednesday launched supervision tools to help parents monitor the activities of children surfing on the platform. The Company in a statement issued by its Head of Instagram, Adam Mosseri described the development as the first step in a long term journey to develop intuitive supervision tools, inspired by experts, teens and parents. Speaking on the vision, Adam noted that the newly launched tools are expected to “allow parents and guardians to help their teens manage experiences across Meta technologies.” The tools will also allow parents to monitor how much time their kids spend on the app, be updated about accounts they have followed lately and who has followed them and receive notifications about any accounts they have reported. He said “Today, we’re introducing Family Center, a new place for parents and guardians to access supervision tools and resources from leading experts,” Instagram’s Adam Mosseri wrote in a blog post. “Today, we’re making these supervision tools available in our new Family Center. We worked closely with experts, parents, guardians and teens to develop Family Center, a new place for parents to oversee their teens’ accounts within Meta technologies, set up and use supervision tools, and access resources on how to communicate with their teens about the internet use,” the Instagram Head explained. The supervision tools are currently available in the US, with plans to roll out globally in the coming months.
