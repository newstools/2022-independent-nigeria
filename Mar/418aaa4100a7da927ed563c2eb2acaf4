The Registrar, Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board, Prof. Ishaq Oloyede, has reiterated the March 26 deadline for the registration of the 2022 Unified Tertiary Matriculation Examination. Ishaq who disclosed this in Abuja on Monday stated that the deadline remained sacrosanct, expressed displeasure at the turnout of candidates at the centre, saying that only one candidate was seen registering at the centre at the time of monitoring. He said, “Nobody should put pressure on us to come and extend the examination. “So when it is March 26, you will see people begging us and putting pressure on us that we should extend. “In our CBT centres, this is what is happening now, they are not coming out to register but one or two days to the closing date, you will see them rushing,” he said. ”We are urging the candidates to come out and register. You can see how vacant the registration centres are as big and as efficient as this centre is, only one candidate is there. “So it shows clearly that students are not coming out or we might have exhausted the number of candidates that are eligible for registration. “Why we are making this campaign, is to call the attention of the public to the fact that students are not coming out, so that there will be no appeal to the board to extend the date,” Oloyede reaffirmed.
