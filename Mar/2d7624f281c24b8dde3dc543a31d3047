Chelsea have been handed a huge boost in their transfer chase for Ousmane Dembele after Barcelona chief Joan Laporta blasted the Frenchman for his wage demands. Dembele is out of contract at the Nou Camp at the end of the season and turned down the offer of a new deal last December. His time at Barcelona has been severely disrupted by injury, but he has finally began to show why the La Liga giants paid £87million to sign him in 2017. In his past five games in La Liga, he has notched seven assists, including two in Barca’s thumping El Clasico win over Real Madrid. But while he has thrived under Xavi, it looks increasingly unlikely he will sign a new deal to extend his stay in Catalonia. Barca president Laporta has poured cold water on suggestions that Dembele could U-turn on his decision to reject a new contract. And even if he did, Laporta has made it clear that he must cut his salary demands in order to be offered another new deal. “We made him a renewal offer that expired on December 20 last year. He decided not to take advantage of that renewal. Now Xavi says that he was counting on him because he is a player who makes a difference,” he told Mundo Deportivo. “The option he had has expired and we are already setting salary levels that all those who stay next season will have to accept. Some levels that have to maintain the sustainability and balance of the club and the squad. “At the moment, for our purposes, we have no news that he wants to continue. I don’t know if his representative has been in contact but I think not because he would know. At the end of the season, I suppose that in some way there will be talks but within the salary levels that we are establishing.” Laporta’s comments would appear to present a big boost to Chelsea, who are thought to have long eyed a move for the Frenchman. The Blues are competing with sides including PSG for his signature, with suitors able to sign him for a bargain if he departs Barca on a free.
