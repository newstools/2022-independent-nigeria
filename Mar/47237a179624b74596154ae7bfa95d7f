UYO – Youths of Iboko Offot axis of Uyo Lo­cal Government Area of Akwa Ibom State on Thursday blocked a portion of Abak Road, where a 60-year-old woman was swept away by flood, due to Wednesday evening downpour. The protest left vehicles plying the road to Abak, Etinan and other adjoining parts of the state with hec­tic time navigating through Ukana Offot, Nkemba and Clement Isong streets, to get out of the capital. An eyewitness and local resident of the street, Anietie Sam, who spoke with our correspondent in Uyo on Thursday, said the deceased was a petty trader along Nkemba Street, close to the scene of the incident.

In his words, “It happened around 4.30 p.m. while it was still raining heavily. We made efforts to rescue her when we noticed she was being swept away uncontrollably by the food but before we got to her, the fast-moving water had drawn her closer to an open hole linking the underground drainage facility.” He alleged that “officials of the state Waste Management and Envi­ronmental Protection Agency had opened the slaps to remove sewage and clear the drains, but failed to cov­er it back for about three years now.” Comrade Effiong Asuquo, one of the protesters, blamed the Min­istry of Environment and Solid Minerals for what he described as “lack of sincere commitment to en­vironmental protection,” vowing, “We will remain here until the state government recovers the remains of the aged woman and adequate com­pensation given for proper burial.” Speaking with newsmen, Com­missioner for Environment and Solid Mineral, Sir Charles Udoh, sympathise with the situation and appealed for calm as frantic efforts were on to retrieve the corpse for burial.
