Tammy Abraham is drawing plenty of attention from the Premier League, but Roma have no intention of letting him go. Most of the top English sides are eyeing the striker, but he is likely to stay put. He has bagged 23 goals across all competitions thus far. According to Sky Sport, he is a fallback plan for Manchester City if they miss out on Erling Haaland. Manchester United would consider him if Cristiano Ronaldo and Edinson Cavani fled. Tottenham have expressed interest in case they lost Harry Kane, Tuttosport relays. Arsenal are also looking for a reliable marksman and inquired about the 24-year-old, Corriere della Sera informs. However, a triple-digit bid might not even be enough to convince the Giallorossi to sit at the table. Roma spent €40M for Abraham last summer, and they are ready to resist any offer. The biggest threat for them will come in the summer of 2023 when Chelsea will have an €80M buy-back clause. If they activated it, it would be up to the center-forward to decide his future. According to the same publication, the Giallorossi have no obligations in the upcoming window. The Blues will have matching rights on any offer. The player is keen on staying and has built a strong rapport with José Mourinho. His agents have a financial interest in keeping him in the Italian Capital, Il Tempo reports. Roma elected to pay the commissions in installments. They are giving his entourage €400k every six months, which would cease if he left.
