Before Merih Demiral left Juventus for Atalanta in a loan deal, there were endless links with Premier League clubs. Demiral, though very highly rated, was unable to get the regular football he was looking for at the Turin club, with the competition ahead of him very strong. Atalanta managed to get a deal done, and the 24-year-old has been a regular starter for them this season, with 32 appearances to his name so far. According to Turkey’s Fanatik, the Turkey international is receiving attention from elsewhere, with Manchester United, Real Madrid and Atletico Madrid all named in the report. Fanatik say ‘the Red Devils want him too’, after covering interest from the Madrid clubs. Manchester United are said to be closely following the defender, ahead of a potential swoop in the summer. According to the report, Atalanta paid €5m for the loan and their purchase clause is set at €28m. There’s no mention whether the €5m would be deducted from the €28m. The club are expected to use their clause, so should Ralf Rangnick’s side want the player then Manchester United would have to go for a figure which presents a reasonable profit.
