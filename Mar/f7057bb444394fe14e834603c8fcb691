Barcelona have been plotting a raid on La Liga rivals Valencia in the upcoming summer transfer window for the signing of left-back Jose Gaya. The Spaniard has emerged as the club’s top target to replace Jordi Alba in the long run and they are keeping a close eye on his contract situation in order to make a swoop before the next season commences. While they have their sights set on one Valencia superstar, another one has been offered to the Catalan giants. Valencia midfield main stay Carlos Soler has been offered to Barcelona by his representative, Rodri Baster, while in conversation with the Catalan giants’ director, Mateu Alemany. Soler is a product of the Valencia youth setup and made his senior breakthrough in 2016, from which point on he has been a regular in the side, notching up 212 appearances for the club so far, in which he has 33 goals and 30 assists. A versatile operator, who used to operate on the flanks in the early stages of his career, the 25-year-old has found his habitat in the centre of the park in recent years, from where he has impressed with his goalscoring abilities. Soler scored 12 times in 34 games last season and looks well-placed to eclipse that tally this time out, having netted ten goals in 27 matches already. Like Gaya, Soler, too, has a contract that expires in 2023 and is yet to sit down with Los Che for negotiations over a new deal. While his agent has offered the Spanish international to Barcelona, director Alemany has turned down the opportunity as he believes that it was a tactic from the player’s camp to get him a better contract at Valencia. POLL Furthermore, Barça are already closing in on the signing of a goalscoring midfielder in Franck Kessie on a free transfer and will not have a need for another player in the position.
