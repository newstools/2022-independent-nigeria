One of the foremost underwriting firms, Great Nigeria Insurance Plc promotes one of its in-house generic products MotorFlex Insurance. In a press statement made available during stakeholders engagement held at Great Nigeria Insurance Plc Head Office situated at 8, Omo-Osagie Street, Off Awolowo Road, Ikoyi, Lagos, the Motor flex is a specially designed Third-Party Motor Insurance policy with extended cover. While commenting, Ms. Oyinkansola Sobande, the company’s spokesperson, stated that every vehicle owner is mandated by law to have the Third-Party Motor Insurance cover; although many members of the insuring public and third party road users have not fully realized the importance of Motor (Third Party) Insurance in Nigeria. Motor (third party) Insurance covers the insured’s (policy holder) legal liabilities for death and bodily injuries to third parties and third party property damage. While remedies for bodily injuries and death are unlimited since we cannot put value on life, the limit for third party property damage is N1million. Third Party Motor Insurance is very important as far as third party road users are concerned. However, many vehicle owners desire to have a cover that provides more benefits than the regular Third-Party Motor Insurance but at an affordable premium not as high as the Comprehensive Insurance. This discovery intimated the organization to develop a customized policy that will meet the specific needs of the target public. GNI MotorFlex insurance is an insurance package that takes care or the insured’s car as well as the third party. In the same vein, Mrs. Cecilia O. Osipitan, the Managing Director/ CEO, mentioned that the organization in its efforts to deepen insurance penetration developed unique insurance products at competitive rates aimed at assisting policy holders in risk mitigation.
