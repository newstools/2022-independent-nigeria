Ghana Black Stars Head Coach Otto Addo will name his team for the 2022 World Cup playoff against the Super Eagles of Nigeria today, according to Sportsworldghana. com. The new Black Stars coach, it was learnt, would pick 25 players for the twolegged clashes for a place in the next FIFA World Cup in Qatar later this year. Ghana will host Nigeria on 25th March at the Cape Coast stadium before travelling to Abuja for the reverse fixture on 29th March.

Omokaro speaking in a chat with brila.net stressed that the month is here and the time to prove their mettle was drawing closer by the day. He added that the success of this technical crew would go a long way in determining the trust and confidence of Nigerian coaches, which has been eroded in the past. In a related development, the Nigeria Football Federation and its Ghanaian counterpart are reportedly making moves to lure Genk defender Mujaid Aliu Sadick to play for their respective country in this month’s World Cup play-off. Mujaid was born to a Nigerian father and a Ghanaian mother and therefore is eligible to play for both countries. POLL The 21-year-old was born in Spain and thus could nationalize for the European country as well. According to sportsworld publication in Ghana, the NFF has begun talks with the Belgium-based centre- back. Nigeria is said to be working on getting Mujaid Aliu to pledge allegiance alongside a host of other Nigerians born abroad before their World up playoff clash against Ghana in March. Mijaid has represented Spain at youth level, U-17 and U-18. He joined Genk last summer from Deportivo La Coruna and has played 17 Jupiler League games scoring twice.
