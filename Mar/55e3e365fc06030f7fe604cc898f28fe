The Nigerian Exchange (NGX) has had a strong start to the year, up 10.7 per cent year to date, thanks to gains in bellwether stocks, a rally in oil and gas names like Seplat, fueled by strong crude oil prices following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, and a strong rally in newly listed stock BUA foods which has since cooled. In comparison, Joburg and Nairobi have struggled, returning -1.3 per cent and -1.0 per cent respectively. Looking at the NGX’s performance in February, analysts at FBNQuest observed that it lagged its larger rival, returning +1.7 per cent versus Joburg’s +2.4 per cent. Back to Nigeria, it appears that the initial euphoria by domestic investors has waned. Also, the rise in crude oil prices has not piqued offshore investors’ interest. “Unlike prior years when rising crude oil prices acted as a positive catalyst for the NGX because the offshore community viewed Nigeria as a promising investment destination, Nigeria has fallen out of favour largely due to issues relating to fx liquidity. “The pipeline of delayed external payments, whatever its size, is plainly a disincentive, analysts said. Also, unlike most oil producers, Nigeria’s gains from higher oil prices will be partly offset by a huge subsidy bill that increases as oil prices rise. POLL “In contrast, the commodity-heavy Joburg exchange, which is home to several mining businesses, is likely to benefit from the Russia-Ukraine conflict, since mining companies will benefit from the windfall from rallying metal prices. In addition to boosting domestic capacity in the oil and gas sector in areas like refining, Nigeria must implement market-oriented reforms such as full deregulation of fuel prices and fx reforms to generate greater value in its economy”, the analysts added.
