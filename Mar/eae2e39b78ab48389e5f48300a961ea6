Real Madrid icon Cristiano Ronaldo has set new personal benchmark in goal scoring excellence with a virtuoso display in Manchester United’s 3-2 win over Tottenham. Ronaldo was recalled to the starting line up after missing United’s 4-1 derby defeat at Manchester City last weekend and he responded in typically dominant style. Two first half goals put United in front at the break, before a late header sealed the win, and a first hat trick since his return to Old Trafford last summer.

A statemented return to form will have United fans full of confidence over their Portuguese talisman ahead of next week’s Champions League last 16 second leg at home to Atletico Madrid.
