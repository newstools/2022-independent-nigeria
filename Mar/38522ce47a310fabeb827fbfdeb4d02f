He said, “The Gedu-Sabo-Oroki road which was awarded by the State Government, is ready for public use. We only await the desilting of the drainage system and then finalizing the road markings. “The inspection today is just to ascertain that all the specifications given to the contractor were followed and to the best of my knowledge, we have actually checked the wearing course. It is satisfactory. The drainage system followed the specification of 1meter and all other instructions that were given to the contractor. Also, our counterpart in the Ministry of Energy has installed all the electric poles.” Addressing the initial poorly constructed bridges on the road which the Governor directed to be pulled down, Sangodoyin said that the bridges are now well constructed. “The one with 2 cells has been increased to 4 cells. While the one with the failed wall has been properly constructed and every other instruction and specifications has been duly followed by the contractor”, he said. POLL He however admonished road users to be careful of over-speeding as the road is now very smooth, adding that in due course they’ll observe how people speed on the road to know where to put speed breakers and every other necessary road sign.
