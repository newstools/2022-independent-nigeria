Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky delivered a stirring address to the European Parliament on Tuesday that at one point got so emotional it had the translator choking up. Zelensky spoke to the European Parliament remotely from Kyiv on Tuesday amid Russia’s ongoing invasion of Ukraine. He spoke about the “tragedy” that has been unfolding after “five days of full-scale invasion” by Russia, telling European leaders “we are giving away our best people” in the fight for freedom and that 16 children were killed the day before. Zelensky also told the parliament it had been a particularly tragic morning for Ukraine after two cruise missiles hit Freedom Square in Kharkiv. As the Ukrainian president described this attack, the translator grew emotional and began to choke up.
