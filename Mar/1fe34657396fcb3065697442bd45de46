ABUJA – Thousand of youths and women in the ruling All Progressives Congress have endorsed former Lagos state Governor, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, as the party’s consensus presidential candidate for the forthcoming 2023 general elections. To demonstrate their support for Tinubu, the party’s national leader, the group from 19 northern states and the Federal Capital Territory have announced that it will hold a national rally in the FCT on Thursday. Addressing newsmen on the planned rally, Secretary of the planning committee, Barrister Adamu Abubakar, said the exercise will be the mother of all rallies in the history of the country. Abubakar said the youths and women across the northern states and the FCT will converge in the nation’s capital in their numbers. He said the march will culminate at the Aso Villa where Tinubu will be presented to President Muhammadu Buhari as his successor. Abubakar said the choice of Tinubu was due to his incredible pedigree, experience and resumé. He, however, enjoined other youths and women from the north to throw their weight behind Tinubu. Abubakar noted that Tinubu is respected and widely accepted, especially in the north where he is only second to President Buhari in terms of followership. POLL Abubakar added that the APC leader will sustain infrastructural strides, economic reforms and other remarkable legacies of the president.
