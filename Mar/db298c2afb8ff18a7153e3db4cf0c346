The most appropriate note on which to commence this di­alogue on the controversial clause 84(12) of the much-de­bated and anticipated electoral Act 2022 is by adopting the aphorism that when two elephants fight, the grass suffers. The reasons for applying the elephants’ metaphor may not be obvious. But it is simply because the final battle in the war to reform our country’s electoral system was between the all-powerful governors’ forum currently led by Kayode Fayemi, Ekiti State Governor, on one side and the National Assem­bly, with Ahmad Lawan, the Senate President and Femi Gbajabiamila, the Speaker of the House of Representa­tives as leaders of National Assembly, NASS, on the other side. I will dwell further on the victor and vanquished aspects of the epic battle between both gladiators in the course of this discourse. But at this juncture, it is pertinent that we first of all focus on the commendable leadership sagacity exhibited by President Muhammadu Buhari in the course of birthing the newly minted electoral act 2022. Now, some hawkish people in the presidency might have advised Pres­ident Buhari not to be perturbed by public criticism whenever he gets tongue-lashed by some elders who speak out, no matter whose Ox is gored, and who are from across the regions ranging from Pa Ayo Adebanjo, leader of Afenifere, from the southwest, Prof. Ango Abdullahi, head of Northern Elders Forum, as well as Prof. Ben Nwabueze, Chairman of Igbo Leaders of Thought and longest-living senior advocate of Nigeria from the southeast. Saving Nigeria’s Education Sector From Total Collapse Ministers And Their Report Cards And the devil-may-care leadership style advocates on the corridors of presidential power, would have justi­fied their advice to President Buhari, not to be accommodating or tolerant of criticism and critics by sowing the ni­hilist idea into his mind that whatever he does as a leader would be considered as unsatisfactory and, therefore, criti­cised unnecessarily. But following Mr. President’s com­mendable action of signing into law, the much desired and anticipated Electoral Act 2022 on Friday, February 25, 2022, and the massive applause that he has received from a broad spectrum of Nigerians, including the clergy and the international community alike for the exemplary leadership that he has exhibited in assenting to the bill even if he has expressed reservations about some elements in the Act particular­ly clause 84 (12), by now, it must have dawned on President Buhari who has been fooling who. That is because, today, it is manifest that Nigerians are capable of acknowl­edging and commending good work by their president with adulation, as re­flected by the torrents of encomiums which have been flowing in the direc­tion of President Buhari from not only civil society organisations that were in the forefront of the struggle for electoral reforms, but even from re­gional ethnic and cultural groups (that in light of the current human carnage and misery saw no good in Buhari’s presidency) such as Ohaneze Ndi Igbo from the southeast, Afenifere from the south­west and Arewa Forum from the north as well as Pan Niger Delta Fo­rum, PANDEF from the south-south; not forget­ting Middle Belt Forum, MBF, including Inter-par­ty Advisory Council -an umbrella body of all reg­istered political parties, since Friday, February 25 when President Buhari signed off on the Act. Given the massive welcoming ap­proval accorded the electoral Act 2022 by the critical mass of Nigerians, I would argue that no policy initiative of the government in Nigeria in recent history has received such a consensus and broad range of support from across ethnic, religious, and cultural divides in our country, except the UDOJI award (payment of bonus salaries to reward public servants for their support and dedication during the difficult period of the war 1967-70) by the government under then military head of state, Gen­eral Yakubu Gowon in 1974. In my assessment of the current state of affairs in our country, based on the high level of despondency, it is only a decision to restructure the political and social-economic systems as well as the introduction of state police by Pres­ident Buhari that could have made Ni­gerians heave the type of sigh of relief that the signing of the electoral Act 2022 has elicited. But those critical yearn­ings of the masses which are policies, if executed, would advance the status of the entity known as Nigeria from being a mere country to a nation via astute and patriotic leadership, would remain a mirage. POLL That is simply because restructur­ing the political system and introduc­tion of state police which were the heart of the ruling party, APC’s cam­paign in 2015, that enabled it to clinch the leadership of Nigeria at the center over seven (7) years ago are being treat­ed like plaques. Hence even the recently concluded review of the constitution led by my good friend and brother, Ovie Omo-Agege, deputy senate president, did not even get that critical desire of Nigerians listed for consideration on the floors of NASS, how much more receive the privilege of being debated. The neglect of restructuring and state police in the review of the constitution appear to be deliberate as they are the key components of the report submit­ted by the Nasir El-Rufai led committee set up by the ruling party to chart the way forward. Already, Nigerian wom­en are literally up in arms with NASS for ditching their demand for 35% of seats to be allotted to them as a sort of affirmative action, just as traditional rulers are also aghast that their quest to be assigned a more active role in governance was not factored into the reviewed constitution. That is a subject for another day. By assenting to the electoral bill and its sub­sequent conversion into law, President Buhari has conferred on Nigerian pol­itics, a breath of fresh air to replace the putrid and toxic elements intrinsic in the electoral act 2010 which has been in operation since the last reform carried out by the pair of ex-presidents Umaru Yar’Adua of blessed memory (2007-10) and Goodluck Jonathan (2010-15). It may be recalled that both former Presidents had improved upon the version handed over by the military that signed the problematic 1999 con­stitution of the federal republic of Ni­geria that had just undergone another review and amendment on 1/3/2022 by the National Assembly, NASS. Is it not preposterous that the electoral law which had lost its flavor as it was sim­ply inhibiting our ability to organise elections that are free and fair, as iden­tified as far back as 2018 when the idea of electoral reform was first mooted and pursued by NASS, had remained unimproved upon due to mere political chicanery? It is such an indictment on the political class that the 2010 electoral act had remained unchanged after 12 years of its application in the recruit­ment of our political leaders, during which flaws that needed to be reformed urgently were identified, but of which President Buhari had been reluctant to effect, until Friday, February 25, 2022, when he appended his signature. That is because, since the idea of reforming the electoral system via a review of the 2010 electoral act was first muted in 2018, (4th review since 1999) the journey to electoral reforms has not only been full of twists and turns, it has actually been torturous for most Nigerians who have some­how been tormented by the back and forth movement of the bill between the executive and legislative arms of government until it finally became law on February 25, 2022. Arising from the rigorous exercise that involved the National Assem­bly (NASS) passing the electoral Act amendment bill for a record five (5) times and transmitting the same to president Buhari who had been de­murring from signing-off on it for the same number of times, l was compelled to tag the 2021 electoral bill an Abiku/Ogbabje bill, (stillbirth in African my­thology) in one of my previous essays titled: ‘Electoral Act Amendment Bill: Interrogating The Ogbanje/ Abiku Ele­ments’ focused on the issue of electoral reforms and its potential benefits to the body politics of our beloved country underscoring the multiple times that president Buhari vetoed it. Adamu Must Go The Fool Called Man And His Wasteful Wars! And the wisecrack, no pain, gain rings true in this instance. That is be­cause it is particularly heartening that after the epic struggle, Nigerians are now in a position to be the major bene­ficiaries as the reforms of the electoral system are bound to lend the political system the required fidelity that would motivate more members of society, par­ticularly those who felt that owing to the opaque nature of the electoral process, their votes would not count, hence they have been shying away from exercising their franchise in previous elections. Based on the improvements which the 2022 reform has conferred on the electoral system, going forward, espe­cially during the 2023 general elections, which is barely one year away, Nigeri­ans would likely turn out massively to vote, more so because of ballot stuffing and snatching, as well as election result falsification that used to trigger vio­lence in the polling units, are deemed to have been eliminated by electoral act 2022. The optimism is derived from the belief that the new electoral law has institutionalized transmission of results electronically from polling booths to the INEC database and makes it impossible for votes cast in a partic­ular polling unit to be more than the registered or accredited voters in that location. Those were some of the tricks that politicians leveraged in the past to produce perverse election results that generated pre and post-election violence that hitherto defined politics in Nigeria and pinned political actors down in law courts for the better part of their tenure while governance suffered. In that regard, by and large, the Elector­al Act 2022 can be said to be an elixir that is guaranteed to induce political sanity into our country’s beleaguered democracy. In an uncanny way, perhaps the past five years (2018 till February 25, 2022) of trying to get President Buhari to assent to the bill in the multiple times that it was passed by the National Assembly, NASS was not wasted after all. The as­sertion above is derived from the fact that had the process not been delayed and were it not that, apart from our law­makers, the executive arm of govern­ment, and civil society organisations, under the auspices of YIAGA Africa and CUPP (civil society, political par­ties coalition and democracy advocacy groups), as well as ordinary Nigerians, that generally got involved in pressur­ing the incumbent president to build on the reforms of the electoral system implemented by his predecessors, Umaru Yar’adua of blessed memory and Goodluck Jonathan that institut­ed the justice Lawal Uwais committee which reviewed the electoral act 2010, that just amended; electoral 2022 would not have been this robust. But due to some omissions and com­missions on the part of the executive arm, particularly the presidency which remains unresponsive to the stimuli of the masses that could have generated empathy for president Buhari, it was assumed by most Nigerians that Aso Rock was disconnected from the reality of the masses, a belief underscored by the initial reluctance of Mr President to assent to the bill which is contrary to the wish of the critical mass that are literally dying for a much better elec­toral system. Having finally signed the bill into an act of law on February 25, 2022, Presi­dent Buhari has proven wrong those who assumed that he was not keen on bequeathing the legacy of a reformed electoral system to the country before he exits power in 2023.
