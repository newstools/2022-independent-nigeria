The People’s Democratic Party (PDP) on Monday said that the emergence of Abdullahi Adamu as the National Chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC) would worsen corruption and economic hardship in the country considering his history with the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC). The National Publicity Secretary of the party, Debo Ologunagba in a statement issued to newsmen alleged that the convention that produced Adamu, a former governor of Nasarawa State, as the National Chairman of the APC was a “jamboree of lies, a celebration of illegality, corruption and arrogance in failure.” According to the party, “imposition of Sen. Abdullahi Adamu, a man who was arraigned in Court on a 149-count charge of alleged fraudulent award of contracts and stealing of public funds estimated at N15 billion, as its National Chairman,” shows the party is not ready to fight corruption. The statement said in part, “It is clear that with the combination of the corrupt, deceitful and rudderless (Muhammadu) Buhari-led APC government and the illegitimate Abdullahi Adamu-led party leadership, corruption, economic hardship and rudderlessness in the APC government will worsen in our country in the remaining one year of the APC administration. “The composition of the APC national leadership is a clear confirmation that President Buhari has never been committed to the fight against corruption as well as his willingness to further open our national vaults to ravenous treasury looters in the APC. “Moreover, it was appalling to see APC leaders come out one after the other at their national jamboree to spew out lies and false performance claims on the economy, infrastructure and security even in the face of biting economic hardship, high cost of living, excruciating fuel emergency, lingering crisis in the education sector and escalated insecurity that was happening real-time and simultaneously when the ridiculous claims of achievement were being made. “Is it not shameful that while APC leaders were lying on stage in Abuja, terrorists were busy attacking the Kaduna International Airport, located in an APC controlled state?” The PDP called on Adamu to “inform Nigerians why he was not courageous enough to submit himself to trial at the Federal High Court, Lafia, Nasarawa State rather than hide under technicalities” POLL “Senator Adamu should therefore come clean to Nigerians on the said case before parading himself as a saint,” it added.
