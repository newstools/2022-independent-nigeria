LAGOS – Reactions have continued to trail the invitation of players for the 2022 FIFA World Cup qualifying playoff against the Black Stars of Ghana. Samson Siasia, former coach of the Super Eagles, criticized the list dropped recently by Coach Austin Eguavoen, saying there was no need to include played that had not been with the team since their qualifiers up to this stage, saying such would affect the synergy and understanding already built in them. The list included new names Akinkunmi Amoo and Ademola Lookman, long term injury absentee Oghenekaro Etebo and Ogenyi Onazi, who has not been invited to the Super Eagles for over two years, was named on the standby list.

So for me, this is not the right list.“ The first leg between the Black Stars and the Eagles will hold on 25th March in Cape Coast while the reverse fixture will take place four days later in Abuja.
