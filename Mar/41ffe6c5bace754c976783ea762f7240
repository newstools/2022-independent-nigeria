ABUJA – President of the Trade Union Congress of Nigeria, Comrade Quadri Olaleye, has confirmed the killing of its Secretary General, Comrade (Barr.) c and Kwara State Chairman, Comrade Akin Akinsola in the Monday night terrorists attack in Kaduna. He said they were among the people killed by terrorists in the Abuja-Kaduna train bombing that occurred yesterday around past 7:00pm. According to Olaleye, they were on their way to Kaduna for an official assignment slated for today, Tuesday 29 March, 2022. Comrade Ozigi served in the capacity of General Secretary, Construction and Civil Engineering Senior Staff Association (CCESSA), an affiliate of TUC for almost two decades before he joined the Congress in 2012. Comrade Akinsola was a staff of Dangote Flour Mill under OLAM. They were both seasoned Trade Unionists. We call on government at all levels, especially the Federal Government to rise up to the occasion to stop the killing of innocent Nigerians. As it stands, no where is safe now – we can not travel by air, road is not safe and neither is the rail. Is Nigeria a failed state? It is unfortunate. “The Congress condoles with the families and friends of our comrades and the good people of Kogi State for this irreparable loss. May God rest their soul,”the TUC President prayed.
