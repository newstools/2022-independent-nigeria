Residents of a California city were warned of an unusual danger when a mountain lion took a daylight tour of a neighborhood before settling in to relax on the porch of a home. The mountain lion was spotted earlier during the week wandering near Country Club Lane and Mill Street in Selma. Police said a caller initially insisted there was a tiger on the loose in the area, but the video captured by a resident identified the animal to be a mountain lion.

Rene Garza said. According to eyewitnesses, the feline wandered through yards for several hours before climbing onto the front porch of a home. Fortunately for residents, the California Department of Fish and Wildlife has captured the mountain lion and released it back into the wild in the Kings National Forest. ROLAND OBIOMA OGBONNAYA
