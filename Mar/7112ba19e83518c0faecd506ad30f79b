Dangote Cement Plc (DANGCEM) on Tuesday, March1, 2022 released its audited statements for the financial year ended (FYE) December31, 2021 (FY ’21). A close analysis of the results showed that both Revenue and Net Income (PAT) expanded by 33.8% and 32.0% to settle at N1.38 trillion and N364.44 billion respectively compared to FY ‘20 records. The company’s topline growth was bolstered by strong performance recorded in the standalone Q4 ’21, where revenue leaped by 32.5% to N361.45bn (26.1% of the FY-21 revenue). Notably, sales from Nigeria operations (units) contributed 71.2% (2020: 69.6%) to the revenue, while Pan-Africa operations (units) contributed the rest of 28.8% (2020: 30.3%). From the 71.2% contributed by Nigeria units, 3.7% (2020: 1.5%) came in for income realized from abroad sales (export), as the Nigeria units continues to support demands and operations of Pan-Africa units. Cost elements reflects challenging business environment As the Group’s business lines continue to witness expansion, cost lines equally rose. However, the sales’ (revenue) growth rate was faster than the rate of cost-line items. While Cost-of-Sales and OPEX rose by 25.8% and 8.1% respectively in the period (due to capital intensive nature of the business), sales rose by 33.8%. Again, cost-line items appeared to be better managed, as Cost-to-Sales (CoS) and OPEX-to-Sales dropped from 42.3% and 20.6% in FY-20 to 39.8% and 18.4% respectively. Due to devaluation and variability of Naira exchange rate to Dollar and other Pan-Africa currencies, Finance cost rose by 49.4% to N65.7bn. POLL The management noted that amid the challenged business environment, the average effective interest rate on funds borrowed per annum was 10.75% (2020: 9.67%) and 11.3% (2020: 8.52%) for Group and Company respectively. Bottom-line looks up amid subdued cost lines Notwithstanding increase in tax obligations by 78.9%, Net Income for the period rose by 32.0% to settle at N364.35 billion, ably aided by subdued cost-line items. Notably, both PBT and PAT margins rose by 38.9% and 26.3% (vs 36.1% and 25.7% in FY-20) respectively. Return-on-Average-Equity employed (RoAE) rose to 37.1% compared to 30.9% in FY-2020.
