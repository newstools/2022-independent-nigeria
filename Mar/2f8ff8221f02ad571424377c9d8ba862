Bishop David Oyedepo, founder and presiding pastor of Living Faith Church, also known as Winners Chapel Worldwide, has explained that he only celebrates his birthday once in ten years due to lack of time. The cleric disclosed this while preaching, expressing that he rarely acknowledges birthday wishes every year. Oyedepo said, “For lack of time, I can only celebrate a birthday once in ten years. Any other day that you greet me regarding my birthday, you are on your own. “Only hard workers emerge as high fliers in the race of life. People are so lazy today that food is their uppermost priority. They sit down around food as if it is their enthronement”.
