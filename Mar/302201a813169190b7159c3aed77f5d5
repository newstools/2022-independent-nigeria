Bode George, chieftain of the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) on Tuesday revealed why he is against the National Leader of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Asiwaju Bola Tinubu becoming the next President of Nigeria in the 2023 general election. Bode George who spoke on Channels TV’s Politics Today accused Tinubu of completely taking over the resources of Lagos State. According to him, he has nothing personal against the APC national leader but he should allow power to change hands because he has been in charge for too long. Speaking he said,  “He has completely annexed the resources of my State. I have absolutely no personal grudge against Tinubu. What I have against him is the plundering of the finances of the State. “Which country will have the Internal Revenue Service and will now set up a company solely owned by him and his cronies, collecting the taxes of the people on behalf of the Internal Revenue Service, how? This doesn’t make any sense. “This fellow has plundered and mismanaged the finances of this State to a stupor that calls for attention.”
