The United States Department of State has announced fresh sanctions against 11 Russian military leaders. All property and interests in property of the individuals in the United States or in the possession or control of U.S. persons are blocked. In addition, all transactions by U.S. persons or within the United States that involve any property or interests in property of designated or otherwise blocked persons are prohibited unless authorised by a general or specific licence. These sanctions include the making of any contribution or provision of funds, goods, or services by, to, or for the benefit of any blocked person and the receipt of any contribution or provision of funds, goods, or services from any such person. A statement by the Department said the sanctions were caused by their roles in Russia’s “premeditated, unprovoked, and unjustified attack on Ukraine”
