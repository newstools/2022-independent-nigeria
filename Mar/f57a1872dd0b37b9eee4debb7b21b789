Nigerian singer and songwriter, Chukwuemeka Robert, popularly known as Bob Em has said that his recent single, ‘Tinquankom’ is inspired based on the sufferings around the world, on the streets of Africa, especially in Nigeria. According to him, the song serves as a forerunner for his soon to be released body of work which would still be in line with his primary focus towards humanity. “ Speaking on his latest project, he said; “I am working presently on a new track which will be released on the 18th of March 2022. Subsequently, an EP and album will follow by the grace and mercy of God. This and much more I’m working on with my team so as to continue to do what we know how to do best.” On one thing about the music industry he would like to change if he had the power he said, “There are many talents in Nigeria and Africa wasting away because they have no one to sponsor them to showcase their talents to the world. I would love to correct and change that if I can also see how I could use myself to encourage others as well.” According to the artiste, his passion and drive for music knows no bound and this he expresses saying; “I was inspired to do music firstly because I love good music. I am a lover of humanity so I wish to use my music as “the voice”, expressing the inner groaning of the poor masses out there, especially in Africa. I am “the sign” to everyone struggling with one challenge or the other that everything will be all right someday. I also wish to use my music to speak to the conscience of leaders all over the world, particularly in Africa, that they may be true servants instead of rulers to their people so that Africa will be lifted out of their present precarious situation and build a brighter future for generations to come.”
