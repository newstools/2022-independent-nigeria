The Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) has apologized to the federal government and football fans following the failure of the national team to qualify for this year’s World Cup in Qatar. The Super Eagles had on Tuesday played out a 1-1 draw with Ghana in Abuja NFF General Secretary, Dr. Mohammed Sanusi, said, “There was nothing the team needed that was lacking. The Government provided necessary support; the NFF put all logistics in place with the active support of the Sports Ministry and; Nigerians turned out en masse to support the team. The truth is that we left nothing to chance. It is sad that things turned out the way they did. “Sport is about winning and losing. Nobody wants to lose but sometimes it happens that way. We are quite sad that despite playing a draw in Kumasi, the Super Eagles could not win here in Abuja. We apologize unreservedly to the Government and people of Nigeria for this non-qualification,” Sanusi added.
