Founding Pastor of Salvation Ministries, David Ibiyeomie has tagged politicians running for the 2023 general elections as ritualists who are ready to visit any shrine for power. The cleric disclosed this at Salvation Ministries Home of Success/Mid-week service, stating that these politicians will do anything to be in power by 2023. He said, “Election is coming very soon. Do you see any Christian? All of them are ritualists, they are ready to go to any shrine. “Some will kill people to make sure they enter into power, while you are there looking at yourself and saying, you see; they will give me an appointment. My friend, they don’t get an appointment just like that. “Fight your Way and say it is written, he bringeth down one and lifteth up another, therefore this man who is not Born again cannot be, I command him to come down and I will be lifted up. You will pray it through.” “So, don’t say you’re doing a prayer request visiting Men of God. Jesus prayed for Peter; Peter didn’t pray for himself. In praying to take delivery of your inheritance, make sure you locate first the appropriate and relevant scriptures. “Don’t just play with destiny, locate them, sit down and locate scriptures and say No! This life must change. Life is for enjoyment, not for endurement. God’s Word is the sure Word of prophecy. “When you hear prophecy it’s the Word of God. Take the scripture and go back to God and say based on this scripture my life can’t be like this. Based on this Word I can’t be this way, this is not how you created me to be.”
