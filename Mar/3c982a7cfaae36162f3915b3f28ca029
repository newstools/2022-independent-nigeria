Preparatory to the 2022 farming season, stakeholders in Yobe state have been sensitized to enhance peaceful coexistence between farmers in the 17 local government areas of the state. The sensitization was organized by the British Council Managing Conflict in Northern Nigeria and the Communal Support Foundation held in Damaturu, the state capital. In his address, the Yobe State Team Lead, European Union Managing Conflict in Northern Nigeria, Abdulkadir Sambo stated that part of the discussions was to sustain the recovered International Cattle routes which was the major factor responsible for the clashes. “This is a follow-up to the policy dialogue we supported with the Ministry of Agriculture and livestock project in Yobe state on the implementation of the National Livestock Transformation Project of President Muhammadu Buhari”. “The aim was to support different stakeholders on how to engage them and have a very peaceful environment for farmers and herders across the country and today we are having an engagement with Fulani groups so as to have a hitch-free farming season” he explains. On his part, Ibrahim Adamu, Chairman of Miyetti Allah Cattle Breeders Association Yobe state branch disclosed that “absence of the regular meetings between the farmers as well as encroachment of farmlands by the visiting herders is the major challenge”. Chairman, All Farmers Association of Nigeria, Usman Ngari in the state said “there is need for our stakeholders to come together to find a lasting solution to the problem”. Yobe state that is recovering from the insurgency is one of the food baskets in the Northeast with over 70 percent of its population depending on agricultural production. Peace among the farmers will no doubt boost the economy of the state that is also faced with Boko haram insurgency.
