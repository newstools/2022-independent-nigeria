Liverpool star Trent Alexander-Arnold has revealed he will be supporting Manchester United against Manchester City this weekend. Liverpool beat West Ham 1-0 on Saturday evening, to cut the gap at the top of the Premier League table to just three points. The result puts pressure on Pep Guardiola’s side who lock horns with United on Sunday (4.30pm kick off). United are looking to extend their gap from their top-four rivals and were boosted by the win for Jurgen Klopp’s side as the lead stayed at two points. But Arsenal and Tottenham both have games in hand as they stay in touching distance of the Champions League places.

Last weekend I was an Everton fan and this weekend I’m a Man United fan. “Any team that play against City I’m their supporter, hopefully they can do us a favour.” Should Ralf Rangnick overcome Guardiola in his first meeting with the Spanish boss, it will boost United’s top four hopes, as well as putting a dent in City’s title aspirations. United have found the Etihad to be a happy hunting ground in recent years, winning their last three against the Blues, all under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer.
