Manchester United have been linked with a shock move for Aston Villa hero Tammy Abraham. Abraham is being lined up as a potential successor to Cristiano Ronaldo up front at Old Trafford, according to reports in Italy. Il Messaggero, via BirminghamLive’s colleagues at the Manchester Evening News, claims that United are ‘considering’ a move for Abraham after a fine start to life at AS Roma for the England star. Abraham has netted 23 goals in 40 appearances for Jose Mourinho’s side and made history against Lazio on Sunday night when he scored after 56 seconds in the Derby della Capitale, the fastest goal in the match’s Serie A history. The 24 year-old moved to Roma in the summer, signing a contract until the end of the 2025-26 season after a £34 million transfer fee was agreed with Chelsea. Abraham had been heavily linked with a move to Villa before signing for Roma, with other Premier League sides Leicester City and Wolverhampton Wanderers also said to be keen. It was Villa for whom Abraham had hit 26 goals in the 2018-19 season when Dean Smith’s side were promoted from the Championship through its play-offs. Abraham then returned to Chelsea and thrived under Frank Lampard before struggling under current boss Thomas Tuchel. Some Villa supporters wanted their side to move for Abraham when he became available in the summer but Danny Ings was brought in from Southampton in a surprise deal for £30m. Now it appears United may be interested in bringing Abraham back to the Premier League. Ronaldo has scored 18 times in 33 matches this season, including in crucial wins against Tottenham Hotspur and Arsenal in the Premier League, but the Red Devils are likely to want to bring in someone who can press from the front at centre-forward. As far as convincing Abraham to leave Roma and the club to cash in is concerned, it is being reported that United – or any club – will have to come to the negotiating table with a ‘huge offer’ for the player.
