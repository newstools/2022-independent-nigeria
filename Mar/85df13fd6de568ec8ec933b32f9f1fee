As part of activities to commemorate the 70th birthday anniversary of the National Leader of the All Progressive Congress (APC), Ahmed Bola Tinubu, a select ex-Super Eagles team have been shortlisted to feature in a novelty match slated for March 20, 2022. According to the organisers, the novelty football match between the ex-Eagles Internationals and the Team Asiwaju would take place at Onikan Stadium in Lagos on Sunday. Director-General of the Tinubu Support Group, Umar Ibrahim, at a press conference in Abuja, listed the former Eagles players set to play as Kanu Nwankwo, Jay Jay Okocha, Peter Rufai, Tijani Babangida, Mutiu Adepoju, Garba Lawal, Julius Aghahowa, Victor Ikpeba, Uche Okechukwu, Ifeanyi Udeze, Taribo West, Victor Agali, Ike Shorunmu, Victor Ezeji, Obafemi Abiodun, Dosu Joseph, amongst others. He said the match was organised by the pro-Tinubu group in collaboration with the Lagos State Government, while special prayers would hold simultaneously across the six geo-political zones of the country. Ibrahim also disclosed that the 13th Bola Tinubu Colloquium, an annual high-powered policy roundtable, would follow the novelty match and it would attract prominent Nigerians from all walks of life. Tinubu, a former governor of Lagos state between 1999 to 2007, visited President Muhammadu Buhari in January 2022 where he informed him of his intention to run for the Presidency in 2023. His 70th birthday comes up on March 29, 2022.
