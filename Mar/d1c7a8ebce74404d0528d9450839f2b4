LAGOS – Ahead of the anticipated 2022 World Cup qualifying playoff between Nigeria and Ghana, the Super Eagles have been warned to go all out to secure a good result, particularly in the first leg, which will go down at the Gold Coast Stadium in Ghana. Speaking to our correspondent on the game, Coach Ike Shorunmu said Nigeria has what it takes to overcome Ghana, charging the Super Eagles to deploy their full strength against their perennial rivals, the Black Stars. “Honestly I don’t mean to underrate Ghana but we should be able to beat them and get the ticket. “On present form, Nigeria is better than Ghana and that is where I am basing my position on. “If you ask me, I think we don’t have any excuse not to qualify for the World Cup; I don’t think we have any excuse not to get a good result in this first leg. “This is certainly not to discredit the Black Stars because they are a great side. It is just that I have this confidence that we will qualify,” he said. Nigeria has been to the World Cup in all but one since they made their debut in the United States of America in 1994. The only time they missed was in 2006 when the less heralded Angola piped them to the ticket in their group. Meanwhile, Ghana will be gunning to qualify for their third World Cup after their debut in Germany in 2006 and their quarterfinal run in 2010 in South Africa. POLL Nigeria is yet to go past the second round in all their participations.
