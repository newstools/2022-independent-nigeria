Manchester City missed out on a chance to go six points clear at the top of the Premier League as they were held by a resilient Crystal Palace at Selhurst Park. City dominated proceedings, twice hitting the woodwork while defender Aymeric Laporte failed to find the net with the goal at his mercy in the first half. The result means Liverpool can cut City’s lead to one point by beating Arsenal on Wednesday. In front of a boisterous crowd, Palace frustrated their opponents although they created little themselves going forward. A point sees them stay 11th as they boosted their own ambitions for a top-half finish. (SOURCE: BBC)
