Barcelona have made a definitive decision on the future of veteran full-back Dani Alves. The Brazilian right-back became the first signing of new Blaugrana boss Xavi Hernandez at the Camp Nou, arriving on a free transfer after his contract was cancelled at Sao Paulo. The 38-year-old returned to the club after five-and-a-half years away and has instantly become an important member of the first-team squad, making five first team appearances. Barcelona Leave Dani Alves Out Of Europa League Squad Dani Alves To Make Barcelona Debut This Week Despite… However, his long-term future at the club came under scrutiny after Xavi reached the decision to exclude him from the club’s Europa League squad. Alves will celebrate his 39th birthday in May but his energy levels and performances have ensured he is often preferred in the position to Sergino Dest. Alves signed a temporary contract at the club to cover the second half of the 2021-22 campaign, with a decision then to be taken about his future going forwards. However, the Blaugrana held an option to extend this agreement by a further year and they are now set to exercise this. This landmark deal would take Alves up to his 40 th birthday but would ensure that the club do not need to invest further in the position ahead of what could be a busy summer at the Camp Nou. POLL This decision is in spite of the fact that the Brazilian was excluded from the club’s Europa League squad. Barca had to prepare their squad without one of their key signings due to UEFA rules about registrations of new players during the season. Article 46 of UEFA’s regulations states that from “the knockout round play-offs, a club may register a maximum of three new eligible players for the remaining matches in the current competition.”
