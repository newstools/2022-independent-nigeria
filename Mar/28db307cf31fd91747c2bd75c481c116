Pastor Moses Adebayo Ajayi, District Superintendent of the Christ Apostolic Church (CAC), Mount of Salvation, Ketu District, has called on Nigerians to be selfless in the face of hardship and crises experienced in the country presently. Ajayi who gave this admonition at the church’s recent weekly ‘One-Hour With God’ programme, maintained that things had not been working well in the country because a lot of people had been selfish. Ajayi stated that the nation’s commercial, health, security, power and other sectors had not been functioning maximally as the economy had been witnessing near zero growth.

This is not what we bargained for,” adding that God deposited a lot of natural and manpower resources in the land for the good of the people. “Categorically, apart from the country Israel that had a covenant of greatness, Nigeria is the second best country dear to God. God has super divine interest in the nation. “We are endowed with several personalities in the areas of engineering, health/medicines, arts, culture, social science, technology and more in all human endeavors.” Wondering why the people had been suffering, Ajayi stressed that to enjoy massive blessings of God, Nigerians must have fear of God if they want to witness a turn-around in the nation.
