This sequel to the adoption of a motion moved by Hon. Johnson Johnson Oghuma, (APC, Edo). The lawmaker in his presentation noted that Nigeria is currently home to about eight national parks including Gashaka, Gumti, Kainji, Chad Basin, Yankari, Cross Rivers, Old Oyo, Kamuku and Okomu, which individually possess unique natural and biophysical characteristics. He said, “the Parks provide iconic ecosystems and fauna for plants and animal species such as elephant, lions, hippopotamus, monkeys, wild dogs, birds, leopards, buffaloes, reptiles, hyenas, bushbuck, and bats, among others.” He expressed concerns that “aside from poaching and illegal logging activities in the parks, terrorists, kidnappers and other criminals have taken over the forests, turned the reserves to their hideouts.” POLL “The criminals are better equipped and trained compared to the National Parks Service Officers, making it difficult for the park officers to carry out their legitimate responsibilities. “The need to ensure that the National Parks are secured in order to encourage patronage and improverevenue generation should be taken into serious conversation,” the lawmaker added.
