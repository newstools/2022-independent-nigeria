Jurgen Klopp has given his take after Harvey Elliott was contacted by the FA following scenes of celebration with a red flare on Sunday at Wembley. Liverpool beat Chelsea in a penalty shootout in Sunday’s Carabao Cup final and Elliott was seen holding a flare as the players celebrated in front of fans. Elliott was drafted into the squad after Thiago Alcantara’s injury late into the warm-up, but Liverpool’s number 67 played the whole of extra-time and tucked away a penalty in the shootout.

Klopp says he is planning to talk to the young midfielder. “I didn’t speak to Harvey yet. Will I speak to him? Yes, maybe,” said Klopp in his press conference ahead of tomorrow’s game against Norwich. “Harvey is a very young man, on the pitch. And outside his is still a little bit more a boy. But that’s not a problem. “He made a mistake. Because of the role model [position] we have. I will tell him. I can promise he won’t do it again.

He will not do it again.” The 18-year-old has recently returned from a serious ankle injury sustained in September and is becoming an important member of the Liverpool squad.
