Steven Gerrard has been given a huge triple boost ahead of Leeds United tomorrow. The head coach will welcome back Ezri Konsa and Lucas Digne from their respective Covid issues last week, while Carney Chukwuemeka is fit again after missing Villa’s last two matches against Brighton and Southampton with a slight niggle. “We’re in a good place. We’ve got the majority of the team fit and available,” Gerrard said. Gerrard Reveals Why He Sanctioned Matt Targett’s Loan Move To… Steven Gerrard Will Definitely Manage Liverpool One Day –… “There’s only Marvelous Nakamba who we’re waiting for to come back into the group. “Carney Chukwuemeka will join the group, Ezri Konsa’s back available, Lucas Digne’s back, so I’ve got some tough decisions from now until kick-off. That’s the position I like to be in.” After back-to-back victories, Gerrard added: “Where we are in the table, we can’t afford to be complacent. We need to keep pushing because every game is important for us from now until the end of the season. “It’s my job and our job to keep resetting after every game. It was important after a couple of defeats not to get too down and panic, so on the ba ck of a couple of wins when the mood’s changed and people are smiling it’s important we don’t get too ahead of ourselves. POLL “We need to reset from game-to-game because if you don’t and you have any complacency, this league will find you out pretty quickly.” Here’s Aston Villa’s squad in full for Leeds tomorrow, kick-off 7.45pm. Goalkeepers: Emi Martinez, Robin Olsen, Viljami Sinisalo. Defenders: Matty Cash, Ezri Konsa, Tyrone Mings, Calum Chambers, Kortney Hause, Lucas Digne, Ben Chrisene, Ashley Young.
