The Kaduna State chapter of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), has condemned the rising spate of killings, kidnapping, and destruction of property in the State just as it has sympathized with the families of the victims. A statement by PDP State Publicity Secretary Abraham Alberah Catoh, condemned the recent killing of 41 locals, two military personnel during the Fulani militia attack in Agban, Kagoro, and its environs called on the security agents to beef up security around the Local Government. Kaduna PDP, while sympathizing with the family of those killed, wounded, or whose properties were destroyed, called on security agencies, the Kaduna State Government, and the President Muhammadu Buhari-led Federal Government to reorganize the security architecture of the State and the entire country. The statement read, “The killings and kidnappings have become recurring decimals in the last five years of our existence as a people, and this is a sign of total failure on the part of the State and the Federal Government since the government cannot protect the lives and property of its citizens. “We also advise the State Emergency Management Agency (SEMA) to, as a matter of necessity, immediately provide succor to the affected victims,” the statement added.
