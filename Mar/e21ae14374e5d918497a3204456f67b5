The Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) has warned that financial institutions promising easy loans and other financial products easily run into trouble and run off with customers’ money. The CBN issued the warning in Yola yesterday, barely a week after some financial institutions were shut down in Lagos following complaints from customers. The apex bank which held a public enlightenment programme termed CBN Fair in which  it highlighted its interventions targeted at various sectors of the economy, said although the institutions it regulates are robust and reliable, it could not say so for unregistered institutions. The Director of Corporate Affairs, Mr Osita Nwanisobi who represented the CBN Governor at the CBN Fair holding simultaneously in Adamawa and Taraba states, stressed at the opening ceremony in Yola.
