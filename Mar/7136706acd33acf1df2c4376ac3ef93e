ABUJA – The Vice Chairman, Senate Committee on Federal Capital Territory (FCT) and Marine Transport, Senator Tolu Odebiyi, (APC, Ogun West), has commended traditional rulers for their role in the changing of the name of the area referred to as Egbado in Ogun State, to Yewa. In a statement released after the more than four hours deliberation by the Senate on the report of its Committee on Constitution Review, Senator Odebiyi said that the change is as a “result of collective efforts of traditional leaders and other leaders of thought from Ogun West Senatorial District.” He recalled that the Bill which was first read on the floor of the Senate on Wednesday, 4th March 2020, proved “the consistent yearnings of youths, political and religious leaders to have the name ‘Egbado’ changed to ‘Yewa.’” Lassa Fever: Oyo NMA Confirms Death Of Members ‘If Rihanna Was Nigerian’, Toke Makinwa Reveals What Would Have… Ninety-three Senators out of the 95 present on Tuesday voted in favour of the Bill.
