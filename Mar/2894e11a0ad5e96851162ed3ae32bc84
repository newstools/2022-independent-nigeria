India has decided to temporarily relocate its embassy in Ukraine to Poland in view of the rapidly deteriorating security situation in the war-torn country. The decision comes amid increasing Russian attacks on the Ukrainian capital Kyiv and several other prominent cities. The Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) in a brief statement said that the Indian Embassy in Ukraine will be temporarily relocated to Poland.

Since most of the Indians had been evacuated from the capital Kyiv, a substantive part of the embassy had already been working from Lviv, a city in western Ukraine, near the Polish border. On March 13, Sunday, at least nine people were killed and 57 injured in the assault on the Yavoriv International Center for Peacekeeping and Security, located less than 25 km from the Polish border. The military training facility is the biggest in the western part of the country and is traditionally the site of joint drills with NATO. The Kremlin did not immediately reply to a request for comment on the missile strike so close to the border with NATO.
