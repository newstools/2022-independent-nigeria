Wilfried Zaha has hailed Crystal Palace as an “enjoyable team to be part of” following their 2-0 win away at Wolves on Saturday. Jean-Philippe Mateta opened the scoring from close range after Zaha had combined with Conor Gallagher nicely before the Ivory Coast international converted a penalty before half-time. Manager Patrick Vieira has rightly been praised for his work in moving a team to have gone somewhat stale under Roy Hodgson in a more progressive direction.

Zaha has now scored 9 times in 22 Premier League starts and is on course for his most prolific campaign in the top flight, having bagged 11 times last season. Speaking after the game to Sky Sports, the 29-year-old moved to praise his team. “You’re seeing what Michael’s doing on the far side so it’s nice we have so many different options and so many different players that can impact the game. It’s an enjoyable team to be a part of. “We just have to keep our heads down and take every game as it comes, because there’s no easy game in the Prem. Today, second-half, I literally feel like I ran the whole half and didn’t touch the ball! So it’s hard work but we need to keep doing what we’re doing.”
