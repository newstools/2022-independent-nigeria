As part of this year’s World Poetry Day marked globally on March 21, Nigerian youths of voting age, who constitute over 80 per cent of the electorate, have been urged to be part of this celebration by participating in the GoNigeria digital poetry challenge. There is a fabulous first prize of one million naira grand to be won by the best entry, whilst the first and second runners-up will receive N600, 000 and N400,000 respectively. The digital poetry contest, which will run from Thursday, March 17, to Wednesday, March 31, 2022, is aimed at engaging Nigerian youths with a strong inclination towards poetry to showcase their talents and be part of the enlightenment campaign regarding youths’ participation in the country’s electoral process. GoNigeria is a campaign to sensitize Nigerian youths to participate in the electoral process by registering enmasse to vote and collect their Permanent Voter’s Cards (PVCs) in preparation for the 2023 general elections. To be anchored by Dike Chukwumerije, who is a renowned Poet and also a Go- Nigeria advocate, the digital competition offers eligibility to persons between ages 18 to 45 years to participate by creating a 30 seconds poetry video while holding or displaying their PVC and encouraging other youths to register and pick up their own PVCs.
