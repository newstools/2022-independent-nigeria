Akan Okon, Akwa Ibom State Commissioner for Economic Development has resigned from his position as he declared his interest to run for the state 2023  gubernatorial election. Okon who made his intention known via his verified Facebook page during the weekend said his decision to resign was necessitated by the need to focus on his aspiration, which is to contest the 2023 Akwa Ibom governorship election. Okon, who was in charge of the Ibom Deep Seaport project, said he tendered his resignation on Monday, March 14, 2021, stating that Okon, in his resignation letter, thanked the governor for the honour and privilege to serve the state. The statement partly read, “It was an honour and great privilege to serve our State under the leadership of Mr Udom Emmanuel at such an important phase in our history. I am grateful to God almighty and His Excellency, for giving me the opportunity to serve. “I also thank the good people of our dear state for their support and encouragement which motivated me in the discharge of all the tasks and assignments given to me, especially with regards to the envisioned three gateways (Land, Air and Sea) for the rapid development of our dear state and creation of job opportunities for our teeming and very enterprising youths.” The former commissioner said he strived diligently to interpret Governor Emmanuel’s vision for the oil-rich state. “As the scripture admonishes, ‘to everything there is a season, and a time to every purpose under the heaven…” Eccl. 3: It is my deep conviction that this is the best time to take a leave in order to focus on my aspiration for the 2023 Governorship election,” he said. POLL Okon is joining other aspirants like Bassey Albert, a senator, and Onofiok Luke, a House of Representatives member, who had already started their consultation for the 2023 governorship election in the state.
