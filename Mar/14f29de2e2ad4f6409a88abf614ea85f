Ilkay Gundogan has repeated his declaration that he sees his future at Manchester City past next summer, but has admitted there are no contract talks taking place just yet. With the German’s current deal expiring in 2023, he said earlier this month that he was relaxed about the situation and hoped to come to an agreement with City over a new deal. “I like life, love the club and feel extremely comfortable. That’s why I can imagine staying beyond 2023,” Gundogan said at the time. “I still have a year’s contract and I’m relatively relaxed. I’ll let it come to me.”  Now, Gundogan has spoken to Kicker about his future and has confirmed that no talks are underway on the deal, but he remains comfortable with the situation. He said: “I’m very happy at Manchester City, football-wise there isn’t a more attractive place at the moment. I can imagine staying there beyond 2023. “There are no concrete talks, but we have a good relationship. I’m still patient. There’s no hurry.” Gundogan also discussed his future for Germany, with the 31-year-old likely to earn a place in their squad for the 2022 World Cup in December. POLL With Germany hosting the European Championship in 2024, Gundogan was asked about his ambitions for both tournaments. “I have a lot of confidence in us and don’t see any nation that is far superior to us. We have a strong team and a good concept. “Results and titles aside, I should be remembered as a talented and good footballer who didn’t deliver the performance I wanted initially but showed what was possible towards the end. “If the mind and body allow it, this European Championship can be an issue. I’ll decide [his international future] after the World Cup.”
