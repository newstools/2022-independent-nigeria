ABUJA – The Federal Ministry of Transportation on Thursday described as false and a terrible misrepresentation the news making the rounds on social media that Rt. Hon. Chibuike Rotimi Amaechi, the Minister of Transportation, had asked Nigerians to contribute to the treatment of victims of the Monday night terrorist attack on the Abuja-Kaduna Train. Eric Ojiekwe, the Ministry’s Director, Press and Public Relations, made the clarification in a statement made available to journalists in Abuja, reiterating that the Minister only directed the management of Nigerian Railway Corporation to liaise with the hospital management and see how much they can contribute for the treatment of the patients. Ojiekwe, therefore, urged the public to disregard these publications as it is not a representation of what the minister did during his visit to commiserate with the bomb blast victims. “The Ministry of Transportation’s attention has been drawn to the story carried by the Print media and other online platforms quoting the Minister of Transportation, Rt. Hon. Chibuike Rotimi Amaechi, as asking Nigerian people to liaise with the hospital management and see how much they can contribute to the treatment of the patients is false and a terrible misrepresentation. “On the contrary, what the Minister said and we have it on record is: “I have said to the Nigerian Railway Corporation to liaise with the hospital management and see how much they can contribute for the treatment of the patients”. “In light of the above, we urge the public to disregard these publications as it is not a representation of what the Minister said when he went to commiserate with the bomb blast victims at 44 Nigerian Army Reference Hospital and St. Gerald’s Catholic Hospital, both in Kaduna on March 30, 2022” reads the statement in parts.
