Juventus are prepared for Paulo Dybala’s departure and they’ve set their sights on Roma talent Nicolò Zaniolo in a bid to replace him. The 28-year-old Argentinian forward has decided not to renew his contract with the Bianconeri, ending a seven-year association with the club in the summer. His departure will significantly weaken the attack of Massimiliano Allegri’s side, so an exciting replacement will be needed as the club look to return to the top. As highlighted by TuttoMercatoWeb, Juventus have chosen Zaniolo as their top replacement for Dybala and they’re ready to make a move for him in the upcoming summer transfer window.
