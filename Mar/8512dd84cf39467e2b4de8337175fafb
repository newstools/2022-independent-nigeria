LAGOS – The Socio-Economic Rights and Accountability Project (SERAP) has asked the Chairman of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), Professor Mahmood Yakubu to widely publish the details of safeguards and mechanisms put in place to protect the privacy and security of election information and data in the custody of INEC, including in its servers, databases and other electronic formats.” SERAP urged him to clarify whether any third-party is involved in the collection, control and use of election information and data, the legal rules and processes guiding the choice of any such third party. Besides, the organization is also urging him him to clarify the other location or locations where election information is stored apart from Abuja, and the details of any third-party who has access to such a database, the safeguards and contingency plans put in place by INEC to address any threats to the privacy and security of election information. In a Freedom of Information request dated 26 March, 2022 and signed by SERAP deputy director, Kolawole Oluwadare, the organisation said: “Ensuring adequate safeguards and mechanisms to protect the privacy and security of election information and data would improve the ability of INEC to effectively discharge its constitutional and statutory duties.” SERAP said: “This would also help to remove risks of attack and unlawful interference by any unauthorised person with election information and data.” According to SERAP, “Widely publishing the details of safeguards and mechanisms of election information and data would also contribute to improving the sanctity and integrity of the electoral process, and public trust and confidence in the process.” The letter read in part: “Putting in place adequate technological security measures to prevent unauthorized access to election information and data would improve the credibility of the electoral process and the enjoyment of people’s right to participate in their own government.” “As an institution, which collects, controls and uses election-related information and data in the discharge of its constitutional and statutory duties, INEC has a legal responsibility to ensure adequate protection of such information and data from threats and vulnerabilities to attack or interference.” POLL “Any interference by unauthorised third-party in election information and data may be used for corrupt, political and other unlawful purposes, and would expose election systems to fraud and meddling, as well undermine the right to participation and the country’s democratic system.”
