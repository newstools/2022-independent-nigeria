Pep Guardiola says he will take a break from football whenever he leaves Manchester City with his contract expiring next summer. Guardiola is into the final 18 months of his contract and has kept his cards close to his chest whenever the subject of an extension is raised. He regularly insists he will be judged on results as any manager would, and says he will talk to the club to discuss his future when the time is right. Now, in an interview with Argentine media, Guardiola says he will not jump straight back into management when his time at City does come to an end. He took a year-long sabbatical between jobs at Barcelona and Bayern Munich.

What has to happen, will happen. When I have to leave City, I’m going to leave. “And I’ll go home and I’ll take some time. That way I don’t have the need to train anymore. Or yes. I don’t know.” Guardiola has long been linked with managing a national team, potentially Argentina. Meanwhile, his admiration for Argentine and Brazilian football has also seen him connected with a club role in one of those countries. Joking about the chances of that happening, Guardiola said: “If I needed to go to Argentina to train, I don’t know, to Boca [Juniors] for example, so that those from Boca don’t get angry because they told me that I praised River? Well, I’ll go to Boca, what do I know? Who knows?”
