Libya’s parliament on Tuesday approved a new government despite the incumbent administration saying it would not cede power. According to Reuters, lawmakers’ voted for Fathi Bashagha as prime minister in a televised process.

Reuters reports that any move by Bashagha to establish a government in Tripoli would trigger armed resistance by Dbeibah, pointing to a return to Libya’s division between rival administrations based in different cities. A vote had originally been scheduled for Monday, but lawmakers were unable until Tuesday to agree upon Bashagha’s cabinet list. Parliament Speaker Aguila Saleh said the newly approved government was voted for by 92 of 101 members present in the chamber, compared to the 132 who voted for Dbeibah’s government a year ago. Libya has been dogged by conflict since the 2011 ouster and killing of former president Muammar Gaddafi. POLL Gaddafi’s death created a political void that various armed groups sought to fill forcefully, sparking clashes across the country. A UN-backed peace process aimed to see the country hold elections in December 2021, but this failed due to disputes over the rules.
