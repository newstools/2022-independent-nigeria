LAGOS – National Leader of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Asiwaju Ahmed Bola Tinubu, on Tuesday abruptly cancelled the colloquium organised for him to celebrate his 70th birthday as the event was about to officially kick-start. Tinubu, who took to the podium was accompanied by the Lagos State governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu, and some other personalities to announce the cancellation. The former Lagos governor, who is also a presidential aspirant on the APC platform for the 2023 general elections, noted that the occasion was supposed to be a joyful celebration of his 70th birthday, expressing gratitude to God for allowing him to see the day. He said, “Today is the 70th birthday of my life on earth. This morning I thanked God almighty for being able to survive to this age despite all odds. I have just been informed since I have been back and forth with prayers in the morning, I didn’t pay attention to the news. I have just been informed of a very sad incident in our country, very sad indeed, that over sixty people and many more were killed on the train by bomb between Kaduna and Abuja just last night. “That is a very serious incident that speaks to the problem of insecurity of lives in the country. It calls for sober reflection. For me to be here celebrating, dancing and enjoying myself, it doesn’t show enough concern of a statesman and a senior citizen of this country. “I will urge the two clergies who are here present to continue to pray and every one of you to go home and pray. This event should not be holding. I have consulted with the people you see around me here and they have agreed with me and being a very committed democrat, I have subscribed myself to their suggestions and we agreed that this event be cancelled. “We pray for the souls of those who had departed prematurely. We pray to almighty God to help us to win this war against evil and set Nigeria on the right path, bless us and provide guidance on all of us in our various ways.”
