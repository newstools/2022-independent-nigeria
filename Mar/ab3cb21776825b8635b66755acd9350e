Some members of the All Progressives Congress have concluded plans to stage a heroic welcome for the Chairman, Caretaker and Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC), Governor Mai Mala Buni, back to the party’s head office in Abuja on Monday. Coordinator of the group Hon. Tope Musbau, said the recent hiccups in the party being championed by some elements were targeted at causing psychological trauma for Governor Buni while on his hospital bed. Speaking to the media, Hon. Musbau said these elements resorted to blackmail and a campaign of calumny to paint the governor in bad light before President Muhammadu Buhari when their initial plot failed.

He said millions of APC supporters across the 36 States will convene in the nation’s capital to welcome Governor Buni as he continues to lead the party to greatness. “Our leader deserves a grand return and that’s what we have planned for him. “We will sound the trumpets, hit the drums, sing and dance because what they planned for Governor Buni didn’t materialise.“He will be ushered back to his office by over 10m party faithful who truly knows his worth and value his quality leadership. “No amount of propaganda can deter the CEPCC chairman. “We are appealing to party stalwarts to converge in their numbers on Monday.“Buni’s return is a victory for our party, victory for Nigeria and victory for democracy” the convener declared. Musbau said Buni has proven his pedigree, dedication and commitment to the growth of the party from his time as national secretary to this moment. POLL He said it is laughable that vested and compromised interests wanted to capitalise on his health-enforced trip to twist the party in their favour.
