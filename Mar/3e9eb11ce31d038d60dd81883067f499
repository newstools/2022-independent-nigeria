Osasere Ekhator Ohonba, who spoke to journalists in Benin on behalf of the family said the land is covered by a survey plan registered on October 13th, 1975. “The land is not only an ancestral ground but also served as our farmland. It is where the Odede Shrine worshipped by the Ekhator family on behalf of the Benin Palace is located.
