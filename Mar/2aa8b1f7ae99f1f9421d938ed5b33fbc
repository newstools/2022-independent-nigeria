Oil prices surged on Tuesday despite new measures aimed at calming markets worried by the invasion of Ukraine by Russia. Brent crude – the international benchmark for oil prices – jumped 10% to $107 a barrel, marking the highest level seen in more than seven years. It rose after the International Energy Agency’s members agreed to release 60 million barrels of oil from emergency stockpiles. Russia is one of the biggest energy producers in the world. As a result, concerns about Russia’s invasion of Ukraine have sparked concerns among investors that oil or gas supplies could be affected. Price rises were steeper in the US, where West Texas Intermediate crude increased by 11% to $106 a barrel.
