BIRNIN KEBBI  – A political stalwart belonging to the ruling APC in Kebbi State, Abdullahi Muhammad Lamba has slammed the outgoing Na­tional Chairman of the interim committee of the All progressives congress, Mai Mala Buni for his role in plunging the party into its present mess. Lamba alleged that Buni is re­sponsible for all the crises in Soko­to, Kebbi, Kano and other states with unresolved issues while con­vention stares the party in the face. He cited the case of Kano State where the former governor of the state, Ibrahim Shekarau won the case twice at the court but Buni didn’t react but immediately the Ganduje faction won he quickly issued a certificate.

It means he has already taken sides with the Ganduje side.” He noted that Buni allegedly caused the rift in Sokoto State be­tween Senator Aliyu Magatarda and did the same in Kebbi between the sitting Governor Senator Ati­ku Bagudu and Senator Alieru, the same problem in Zamfara and the entire issues led to factions and he has not been able to unite them. “The way things are going if justice is not done to dedicated par­ty members and/or stalwarts APC will collapse now or after the con­vention, leaders must be seen as impartial not the other way round. He added that if Buni is gone the party may perhaps come back to life but if the incoming leader­ship of the party walks the path of justice, equity and fairness.
