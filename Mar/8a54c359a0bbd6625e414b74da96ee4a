Ahead of the party’s national convention, An All Progressives Congress, APC, Presidential aspirant, Bola Tinubu, has met with Senator Abdullahi Adamu. Tinubu paid Adamu a solidarity visit in his Abuja residence, on Friday night. A Twitter user @cbngov_Akin1, posted photographs of Tinubu’s visit with a message: “The National Leader of Our Party, APC, Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu @officialABAT paid a solidarity visit to the leading and consensus candidate of our party Sen Abdullahi Adamu @SenAbdullahiA in his house last night ahead of Saturday #APCNationalConvention.” Adamu is said to be President Muhammadu Buhari’s preferred choice to become APC’s next National Chairman. Adamu’s name has since been included in the party’s ‘Unity List’, a list of consensus candidates which the APC is compiling for all its major offices ahead of today’s National Convention of the party.
