FBNQuest Trustees, a subsidiary of FBN Holdings, dedicated to providing Trust solutions to individuals, corporate, and government institutions, brought together Muslim Faithfuls, to share deep insights on the importance of Estate Planning and the provisions within Islam. This event was premised on the understanding that with increasing wealth comes complex Estates, which require robust Estate Planning for asset protection and wealth transfer across generations. The Islamic Estate Planning Clinic was, therefore, organised to address this need. The event which was hosted in partnership with the Metropolitan Law Firm and Universal Chambers held recently in Abuja, Nigeria, and presented an opportunity for the Firm to educate the attendees on the relevance of distributing assets and generational wealth transfer in accordance with Islamic tenets. This Islamic Estate Clinic featured sessions facilitated by Professor Ahmad Bello Dogarawa, a Professor in the Department of Accounting, Ahmadu Bello University, Zaria and a renowned Islamic Scholar; Ummahani Amin, Managing Partner, The Metropolitan Law Firm, Rotimi Obende, Strategy & Business Development, FBNQuest Trustees, Mohammed Yunusa, Partner, Metropolitan Law Firm and Mutiat Olatunji, Private Trust Advisor, FBNQuest Trustees. The sessions covered Islamic Trust (Waqaf), Islamic Will (Wasiyyah), Zakat (Charitable Trust), Hibah and Takaful, among other asset preservation and wealth transfer principles.
