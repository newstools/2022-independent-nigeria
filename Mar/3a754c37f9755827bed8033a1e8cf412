Arsenal are eagerly awaiting the return of Premier League football as they look to wrap up a top four finish. The Gunners are on course to secure a return to Champions League football, but there is work to do yet, with ten games still to play. Arsenal will be raring to go come the end of the international break, but we are not there just yet, with another week to go until club action resumes. In the meantime, we have taken a look at all the latest transfer rumours concerning the Gunners. Arsenal are said to be considering a move for Barcelona defender Ronald Araujo, should the Uruguayan decide not to agree new terms with his current club. Araujo is under contract until 2023 as things stand, but he has already rejected early proposals from Barca, who are trying to save money for big-money arrivals this summer. The Express claim Arsenal and Chelsea are keeping tabs on Araujo in case a new deal can’t be agreed. POLL Arsenal are continuing their search for a new striker as the summer moves closer. The Gunners will want to sign a proven goal-scorer ready to make an instant impact in the 2022/23 campaign, but they may also look to plan for the future. And according to Calciomercato.it via SportWitness, they are considering a move for Reims frontman Hugo Ekitike, who has 10 goals in 23 Ligue 1 appearances at the age of 19. He was also heavily linked with Newcastle United in January, but the Magpies failed to complete their deadline day move. Strangely, there is some chatter that Arsenal are eyeing a move for Brazil head coach Tite. Globo Esporte via SportWitness claim the Gunners are keen to hire the Brazil boss after the upcoming 2022 World Cup.
