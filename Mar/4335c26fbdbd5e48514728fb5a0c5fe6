Filling up a normal size petrol-driven car will soon cost £90 if the price of fuel continues to rise, the RAC warned today. The average cost of a litre of unleaded petrol advanced to 149.3p on Wednesday, with diesel reaching 152.83p, according to the RAC’s Fuel Watch. Just a year ago, petrol prices were 122.5p and diesel was at 125.99p.

Average prices are already predicted to soar past the £1.50 mark for the first time due to the impact on supplies of the invasion of Ukraine and sanctions on Russian oil exports from the UK. Simon Williams, the RAC fuel spokesman, said: “Both petrol and diesel reached new record levels yesterday. “Russia’s actions will now push petrol pump prices up to £1.50 very soon. The question then becomes where will this stop and how much can drivers take. “This would cause untold financial difficulties for many people who depend on their cars for getting to work.” POLL Most days in the last three weeks have seen new daily records for fuel prices as Russia’s invasion intensified.
