LAGOS – The Northern Youths Council of Nigeria of Nigeria (NYCN) has condemned the outrageous declaration of over N500 billion Profit Before Tax and over N350 billion Profit After Tax by Dangote Cement, stressing that the declared amount is a sad reminder of how Nigerians are being ripped off by a monopolist that enjoys government protection and patronage. In a press statement on Wednesday signed by its National President, Comrade Isah Abubakar, the group stated that the average price of a 50 kilogram bag of cement has since increased, currently selling at over 240 percent above global average price despite the fact that Nigeria is the global headquarters of poverty. The statement reads, “Northern Nigeria where Dangote hails from has the larger chunk of this poverty and other frightening negative economic and social variables. 2022 IWD: NGO To Gift 100 Traders, Street Sweepers Food Items 2023: Hope Alive As Gov Emmanuel Reviews Ongoing Projects In… “Rather than make things easy for Nigerians, Alhaji Aliko Dangote is out to ensure that poor Nigerians are turned to destitute in their own country by the continued hike in the prices of commodities he controls,” the group said.
