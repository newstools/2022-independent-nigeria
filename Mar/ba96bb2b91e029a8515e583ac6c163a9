Turkish forces “neutralised” three PKK terrorists in northern Iraq, border areas which terrorists hostile to Turkey use as hideouts, the National Defense Ministry said Monday. Three terror members were targeted with unmanned aerial vehicles during their attempts to attack the Operation Pence-Simsek zone in northern Iraq, the ministry said on Twitter. Turkish authorities use the term “neutralize” to imply the terrorists in question surrendered or were killed or captured. Operation Pence-Simsek is among a series of offensives Turkey has carried out since 2019 against terrorist groups in northern Iraq, particularly the PKK. In its more than 35-year terror campaign against Turkey, the PKK – listed as a terrorist organization by Turkey, the US, and EU – has been responsible for the deaths of over 40,000 people, including women, children and infants. The YPG is the PKK’s Syrian offshoot. SOURCE: YENI SAFAK
