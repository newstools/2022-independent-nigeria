The Senate has rejected the request of President Muhammadu Buhari to amend Section 84 (12) of the Electoral Act which seeks to prevent political office holders from contesting for election from the party primary level without resigning. The bill had scaled the first reading on Tuesday, despite a court order barring the Senate from acting on it. The request was rejected after Senator Yahaya Abdullahi made the lead debate for the second reading of the bill on Wednesday. 2023: Allow Prison Inmates To Vote During Elections, Senate… BREAKING: Senate Deserts Lawan, Throws Out Buhari’s… The Senators kicked against it and voted no when put to voice votes by the President of the Senate, Ahmad Lawan. Before a voice vote on the bill, which nays had it, several lawmakers spoke against going ahead to amend the Act and urged that the Senate abide by a court ruling, which stopped the National Assembly from tampering with the electoral law. President Buhari had, in a letter to the National Assembly last week, asked the federal lawmakers to amend the Act, by deleting Section 84 (12), which, according to him, constitutes a “defect” that is in conflict with extant Constitutional provisions. In the letter, he said the amendment is necessary as the clause constitutes a fundamental defect and leads to the disenfranchisement of political officeholders. Recall that President Buhari on Thursday, February 25 signed the Electoral Act Amendment Bill into law. During the signing, he faulted Section 84 (12) of the Electoral Act, 2022.
