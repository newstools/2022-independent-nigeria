Niger State government has expressed preparedness to support local and foreign agencies including the Acceleration action for the elimination of child labour in supply chains in Africa (ACCEL Africa) for championing the cause against all forms of child abuse. With the intervention of ACCEL Africa and the International Labour Organisation (ILO), child labour and related issues that deny children rights to quality education developing their full potentials will be a thing of the past. Commissioner for Solid Minerals, Mr Sunday Kolo gave the remarks at the opening of the validation workshop of the Niger State Action Plan (SAP) on the elimination of Child Labour which took place at Labour House, Minna the state capital. The commissioner who spoke through the Permanent Secretary of the Ministry, Alhaji Idris Sadiq commended ACCEL Africa for championing the cause of children against all forms of labour-related issues in the state. The National Project Coordinator ACCEL Africa, Dr Agathe Kolawole expressed sadness that many children in Niger state were being subjected to labour-related abuses, especially by miners as slave masters subjecting under-aged children to abuse. Kolawole who called for decisive action against violators of children’s rights expressed preparedness by her office to join hands with the state government and relevant organisation agencies in tackling child abuses to allow children to develop their full potentials unhindered. Also speaking, the Minister of Labour and Employment, Dr Chris Ngige, represented by Barrister Theresa Odoh said Nigerian future leaders will be endangered if nothing is done and urgently too to liberate children from labour related abuse. Federal Ministry of Labour and Employment in partnership with the ILO took up the challenge of ensuring total eradication of all forms of child-related abuses by slave masters hence the essence of the validation workshop.
