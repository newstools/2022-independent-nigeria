LAGOS – As part of its international women’s day month celebrations, leading mobility platform Bolt has brought back Drive for Women in Tech (#Drive4WITech) initiative. The aim is to provide equal opportunities for women in technology and improve overall gender equality in the mobility sector. The initiative includes an internship programme for young women who choose to start a career in technology regardless of their existing educational background. The Bolt #Drive4WITech internship offers opportunities in operations, public relations, marketing, and engineering with access to excellent learning from top Bolt executives to young women across Africa. The immersive program was first launched in 2021 and recorded great success with massive participation. At the end of the programme, some of the interns were retained in full-time positions by the company. The 2022 internship programme aims to extend the achievement of the Bolt initiative and further bridge the gender gap in the technology sector. Oludele Dare, Country Manager for Bolt, while commenting on the initiative, said: “At Bolt, we understand the importance of a diverse and inclusive society for development.
