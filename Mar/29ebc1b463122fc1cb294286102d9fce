Professor Wole Soyinka on Thursday described the protests embarked upon by some indigenes of Ile-Ife over the announcement of a non-indigene as the Vice-Chancellor of Obafemi Awolowo University (OAU) as “crazy”. Daily Independent had reported that since the announcement of Prof Adebayo Bamire as the 12th substantive VC of OAU, some Ife indigenes commenced protest arguing that an Ife indigene should have been appointed. Meanwhile, Prof Rufus Adedoyin, who hails from Ile-Ife, came ninth in the screening, which saw 16 candidates shortlisted for interaction for the post of VC by the Joint Council and Senate Selection Board. Soyinka who spoke at a lecture titled, ‘The Politics of Black Intellection and Creativity, at the University of Pennsylvania, the United States, which was the first of the newly-inaugurated Distinguished Lecture series in African Studies said, “Why should there be an Ife VC anywhere? Reacting to a question by Professor Wale Adebanwi, Presidential Penn Compact Professor of Africana Studies, Department of Africana Studies, University of Pennsylvania, Soyinka said he’s “shocked” over the incessant kidnappings, ritual killings and violence that have become the order of the day in Nigeria. Asked to express his reaction to the agitations that the next Vice-Chancellor of the Obafemi Awolowo University must be an indigene of its host city, Soyinka who was former OAU lecturer faulted the protesters. He said, “An Ife person wrote me and say, look at these people disgracing us. I told him to go there and disgrace them. You are an Ife person. You should be in the front line. “The Ife people should say those people don’t belong to us, we don’t know where they came from. And they should be dealt with ruthlessly. POLL “Why should there be an Ife VC anywhere? I just don’t understand what they put in the water these days. It is crazy.”
