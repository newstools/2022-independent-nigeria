A high level of moral Decadence among children and adults in Nigeria has been attributed to the abandonment of those religious and cultural values which existed in the past. The assertion was made at the weekend in Onitsha by a Catholic Priest, Rev. Fr.  Celestine Aniofor. According to the Chaplain, Onitsha Archdiocesan Laity Council who spoke during a ceremony to observe this year’s Laity Council at Holy Spirit Catholic Church, Omagba Phase ll, Onitsha said that from evidence on ground most families have lost total grip of adequately bringing up their children in respect to values which were highly observed through religious and cultural teachings. Aniofor noted that the church has always been at the forefront of teaching honesty, respect for the elderly and avoidance of sin which are also abhorred by some cultural background and wondered why the issue of moral decadence has so far degenerated. The Catholic cleric who was addressing representatives from various Archdiocesan Regions under the Onitsha Archdiocese, however, acknowledged the fact that social media had contributed immensely to the societal menace and called on parents to monitor activities of their children to forestall the ugly trend. In an interview, President, Onitsha Archdiocesan Laity Council, Engr. Leo Onyekachi Obiefuna disclosed that the Laity Council had advanced plans with relevant authorities in the church to engage in the aggressive reintroduction of Cathechism classes that would be aimed at teaching basic tenets of moral upbringing that is rooted in the church. He regretted that for a very long time Cathechism where basic religious teachings are taught has not been vibrant as it used to be. Laity Council is a group of unordained members in the Catholic Church who assist in the running of the religious denomination.
