The Lagos State Commissioner of Police, CP Abiodun Alabi, has ordered the arrest of a celebrant in the Oniru area of the state where petrol was handed out as souvenirs to attendees in kegs. The police spokesman in the state, Adekunle Ajisebutu, disclosed this in a statement on Saturday. The Lagos Safety Commission and the Rapid Response Squad had earlier sealed off Havillah Event Centre, Oniru, where petrol was used as a souvenir at a party “for contravening public safety rules”.
