China has recorded another steep rise in coronavirus cases as it battles its worst outbreak since the early days of the pandemic in Wuhan. The National Health Commission said that 5,154 cases of COVID were recorded on Monday across dozens of provinces and municipalities. The vast majority of cases are in Jilin province, in China’s northeast. The entire province, of 24 million people, has been locked down and shut off from the rest of the country. People who want to leave must ask the police for permission. But cities around the country have been put into effective lockdown, including the tech hub Shenzhen in the south, home to 17.5 million people. Every residential community there has been locked down, with residents allowed to leave only for PCR testing. Businesses have been ordered to close or work from home.Advertisement Those orders have led to the suspension of a plant run by Foxconn, which produces iPhones for Apple – raising concerns over the impact on supply chains around the world. Other cities including Shanghai and Xi’an have also been subject to restrictions, with residential communities being sealed off. China has successfully managed the virus since it first emerged in Wuhan in late 2019, officially recording just 4,636 deaths in a population of 1.4 billion people. It has employed what it calls a “dynamic COVID-zero policy”, where outbreaks are quickly suppressed through mass testing and targeted lockdowns.
