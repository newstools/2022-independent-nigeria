Reasons have been advanced on why long standing player, Chinedu Ohanachom, termi­nated his contract with Heart­land Football Club of Owerri. According to a club source who spoke to our correspon­dent on anonymity, the senior player saw no reason to re­main at the club with little or no ambition. Recall that Ohanachom mutually terminated his con­tract with Heartland FC as he believed he was no longer in the right frame of mind to play for the Owerri based side again. Mixed Feelings As United Host Spurs Brighton Face Uphill Task Against Liverpool In later addressed to the General Manager of Heart­land, dated 09/03/2022, The lanky forward requested to terminate his existing con­tract as he says he is no longer convinced that he wants to re­main at the club. He stated that his safety is not guaranteed at the club hence his reason to request for his contract to be terminated. He however thanked the club for giving him the oppor­tunity to represent them as he wishes them very best in their future engagements. Ohanachom has played for the likes of Yobe Desert Stars, Plateau United, El Kanemi, Katsina United and Nasarawa United amongst other NPFL sides. Meanwhile, the source said more players were expected to follow in the footstep of Ohanachom. POLL “Chinedu is a very ambi­tious player and when such a player finds himself here, he will most likely not be at home because this club lacks ambi­tion presently. “I think that is what has informed his decision to leave because he was not seen him­self giving his best. “The same applies to all other players here or will I say majority of the players unless the management changes the approach here. We lack mo­tivation to give our best and when there is an opportunity, certainly any player will jump into it,” the source said.
