Anne Hathaway adopted a raw vegan diet to get into char­acter for her latest role in the upcoming AppleTV+ series ‘WeCrashed’. To imitate the life­style of Rebekah Neumann, the wife of WeWork founder Adam Neumann, Hathaway cut out all foods of animal origin and only ate foods that were raw or cooked at temperatures below 40-48°C. “I became a raw vegan,” the Academy Award winner, 39, revealed during an inter­view on The Late Show With Stephen Colbert on Tuesday, explaining that “Rebekah is a very passionate vegan.” Laughing off Colbert’s com­ment about the “roughage” in­volved, Hathaway shared that while filming she became “so deep in my character” that she considered making the plant-based diet permanent. “I think I’m a vegan now,” she remembered thinking. “Like, ‘I think this is it. I know I’ve done it before and I know it’s never stuck but I think this is the time that I’m doing it.” She also told Colbert how her husband Adam Shulman supported the decision — but didn’t judge when her attempts at making the dietary switch permanent fell short. “And then three weeks later when I was like ‘I need a burg­er,’ he was like ‘OK,’” laughed Hathaway, who also practised yoga for the role. Though the Devil Wears Prada star is back to eating meat — “we’re all people,” she told Colbert of sampling ante­lope while visiting Texas last weekend — the vegan diet is one she stands by in theory. “It’s great,” she said. “And we should do as much as we can to eat vegetables for the envi­ronment”
