Moroccan Younes Zerdouk has been appointed as the new head coach of Co­moros, stepping up from his assistant role. The 48-year-old replaces Amir Abdou, who resigned last month after eight years in charge and subsequently took over as coach of Mau­ritania. Zerdouk took charge of the Coelacanths for their defeat by Cameroon in the last 16 of the Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) when Ab­dou was forced to miss the match with Covid-19.

Meanwhile, former Ar­senal player Kaba Diawara has retained his role as coach of Guinea despite the country’s football feder­ation (Feguifoot) earlier re­lieving the technical teams of all its national sides of their jobs. On Friday the Feguifoot normalisation committee released a short statement saying that it would be call­ing for applications for the job as coach of the men’s team in the coming days. However, on Monday it announced that Diawara, who led the team at the Nations Cup in Cameroon, will stay in the role at least for this month’s interna­tional window. Under Diawara the Syli Nationale reached the last 16 of the Nations Cup, where they lost 1-0 to The Gambia. POLL Libya are looking for a new coach after Spaniard Javi­er Clemente left his second stint with the Mediterranean Knights by mutual consent. The 71-year-old’s con­tract had been due to expire in May and he is replaced by his compatriot Ramon Catala on an interim basis. Libya are scheduled to play in a friendly tourna­ment in Mauritania be­tween March 21 and 29. Since Clemente returned last May, Libya failed to qualify for both Africa’s World Cup play-offs and the Arab Cup. All three nations will be involved in the group stage of qualifying for the 2023 Nations Cup (AFCON), which gets under way later this year.
