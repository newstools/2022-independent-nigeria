Following the news of Nigerian influencer Ramon Abbas, known as Hushpuppi, laundering about $400,000 (£304,000) from U.S prison, the US government has debunked the news, stating that the documents posted was fabricated. Recall that some documents which viral on Twitter, claimed that a new evidence was submitted to the United States District Court of California on March 16th, 2022, in a document stating that Hushpuppi allegedly engaged in the acquisition and washing of Economic Impact Payment debit cards obtained unlawfully from stolen data of US individuals and residents. According to BBC news, an official of the US Department of Justice stated that the US Attorney’s Office in Los Angeles, which filed the case against Hushpuppi, has not filed any such document. “The document appears to have been fabricated… We have checked with the FBI who supposedly authored the document, and they confirm it is a fake,” the official said. Recall that, Hushpuppi is facing criminal charges in the United States for conspiracy to launder money obtained from business email compromise frauds and other scams, including schemes that defrauded a US law firm of about $40 million, illegally transferred $14.7 million from a foreign financial institution, and targeted to steal $124 million from an English football club until his arrest by the Dubai Police in June 2020 and his extradition to the United States.
