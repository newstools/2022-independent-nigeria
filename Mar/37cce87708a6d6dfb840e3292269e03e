Despite downplaying the situation, Massimiliano Allegri clashed with four Juventus players regarding the training schedule, not just Paulo Dybala and Juan Cuadrado. La Gazzetta dello Sport details how Dybala and Juan Cuadrado, the captain and vice-captain in the absence of Leonardo Bonucci and Giorgio Chiellini, spoke to the Juventus coach on behalf of the squad in order to ask for the training schedule to be kept as usual. When the Juventus squad play at home, they train in the morning before being allowed to return home until the training retreat in the evening. This time, Allegri wanted the squad to stay at the training ground after the morning session, something the players weren’t keen on. Allegri didn’t take the request well, getting angry with both Dybala and Cuadrado and accusing them of failing to understand the delicacy of the moment. The former Milan coach then summoned the whole squad to express his frustration. This led to a few more verbal clashes with various individuals including Adrien Rabiot and Danilo, but Allegri held strong and didn’t change his mind. Things are a little tense in the Juventus camp following their painful Champions League exit to Villarreal earlier this week.
