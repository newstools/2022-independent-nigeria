A Special Adviser to President Muhammadu Buhari on Political Matters, Senator Babafemi Ojodu has revealed why he will go back to farming if the National Leader of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Asiwaju Bola Tinubu succeed Buhari in 2023. Senator Ojodu who made this assertion on Saturday while speaking in an interview with Chude Jideonwo said that if he does not believe in someone, he does not work with them. Speaking when Jideonwo asked if he would fall in line if Buhari chooses Tinubu as the party presidential candidate ahead of the anticipated 2023 general election, he said, he would never. Ojudu claimed he can never support or work with someone he does not believe in. In his words, ”Never! I’ll never support it. Write it down I’ll go back to the farm. “If I don’t believe in you, I’ll not work with you or for you.” Meanwhile, Ojudu had earlier clarified that he would not support Tinubu’s presidential ambition due to his “principled political choices’, not betrayal.
