LAGOS  – The leaderships of the Federation of Informal Workers of Nigeria (FIWON), the National Union of Professional APP-Based Transport Workers (NUPABTW) and the Professional E-Hailing Drivers and Private Owners of Nigeria (PEDPAN) have amalgamated, and consequently kicked off a campaign driven by the slogan, “nothing For Us Without US” with the objective of achieving formal recognition and adequate representation of informal sector and platform workers for the purposes of achieving decent work and fair remuneration. As jointly deliberated on Monday by the three representatives of the amalgamating unions that cut across Ibrahim Ayoade, President, NUPABTW, Comrade Idris Sonuga, President PEDPA, and Gbenga Komolafe, General Secretary, FIWON, they unanimously disclosed in a statement that the need to protect vulnerable informal sector workers necessitated the amalgamation of the three unions. “The latest World Bank Report states that 80.4 percent of Nigerians work in the informal sector. Like anywhere else, the pandemic distorted Nigeria labour market and worsened the existing unemployment rate thereby forcing many citizens to the informal sector.

Informal sector workers are the most vulnerable to the negative effects of the pandemic because some of COVID-19 measures like lockdowns and curfews have resulted in loss of livelihoods for many informal sector workers who depend on daily wages for survival and have no access to social protection”. They agreed that the above socio-economic situation is been worsened by absence of regulations in both the informal sector and the gig economy, and that that was further compounded with little institutional supports from the government at all levels. They noted that added to the foregoing burdens placed on workers in the informal sectors are constant harassments and extortion by state agents like police who ought to be protecting the already disadvantaged workers continued non-stop. As contained in the statement, “Multiple taxations and levies by both the federal, state and local governments eat deep into the little earnings of the workers” coupled with unfair labour practices by some employers, especially the App-based companies which they say has become the norm.
