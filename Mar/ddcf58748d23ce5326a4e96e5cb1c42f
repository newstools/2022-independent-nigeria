House of Representatives has mandated its Committee on Tertiary Education and Services to investigate the multiple processing and/or administrative fees imposed by the Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board, JAMB on candidates. The investigation was a resolution reached by the House at Wednesday plenary following a motion titled “Call to Investigate the Imposition of Multiple Processing and/or Administration Fees by the Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board (JAMB) and its accredited agents on JAMB Examination Candidates presented by Hon. Sergius Ose Ogun. In his motion, Ogun informed the House that for every other service, apart from the JAMB Registration provided in relation to the examination, an administrative fee was imposed by JAMB, which he said does not include the CBT Centre Service Charge collected by JAMB accredited CBT Centers. According to him, some of the charges included Application for Transfer placed at N7,000; Change of Admission Letter with Registration Number fixed at N5,000; Application for correction of data (like date of birth, etc) at N2,500; Printing of JAMB Result Slip at N1,000; Printing of JAMB Admission Letter at N1,000; Change of Institution/Course at N2,500 and Retrieving of JAMB Registration Number put N1,000. He said “The provisions of the Act, JAMB is an examination conducting body and not primarily a revenue-generating organ of the Federal Government. “JAMB Candidates who are not privileged to afford the charges/fees suffer undue hardships and ultimately lose out from taking the examination. “A majority of the candidates dwell in villages, often without CBT accredited Centres and as such, would have to travel long distances and incur additional transportation costs in order to register for the examination or carry out a JAMB related service offered only in a CBT Centre”. Adopting the motion, the House asked the Committee to report 4 weeks to do the assignment and report back to it for further legislative action.
