Nollywood actress, Adebimpe Oyebade, has responded to critics claims stating that she got married to her actor husband, Lateef Adedimeji because she was pregnant. She disclosed this in a question and answer session via her Instagram page, expressing that the news of her being pregnant is fake. A fan asked, “Sissy, how do you feel when those trolls were saying you got married because you’re pregnant? The actress answered, “How do you feel about fake news? Trolls/bullies do not have a life, too blessed to be stressed about them.” Recall that the couple got in December 2021, despite denying being together several months earlier.
