ABUJA – CEO/Founder TAF President, Albinism Association of Nigeria, Jake Epelle, has decried the upsurge in skin cancer cases among persons with albinism (PWAs) in Nigeria. He added that his foundation has referred 5,500 persons with albinism, skin cancer to the National Hospital Abuja (NHA) for treatment with evidence to show from the hospital. Epelle made this known at a press briefing on Thursday in Abuja to speak to the issue of the rate of skin cancer cases being recorded among Persons with Albinism (PWA) in Nigeria and shed light on the 5,500 referred cases he was called out for. According to him: “We will not be able to exhaust TAF’s past advocacy efforts in this meeting, but the most significant amongst them is the free skin cancer treatment scheme, which the foundation secured during the administration of former President, Olusegun Obasanjo. This scheme was funded by the government through disbursement of funds by the Federal Ministry of Finance to the six (6) designated hospitals in Nigeria’s geopolitical zones (especially the National Hospital, Abuja).
