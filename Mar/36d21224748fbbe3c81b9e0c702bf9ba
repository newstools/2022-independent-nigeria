He said; “ Our youths willing to fight for Ukraine is not patriotism because we have our citizens in both countries. “Secondly, if they want to show their patriotism, they should join the Nigerian Army to confront the security issues bedevilling the country. Thirdly, we don’t want a situation where these young people will go to a foreign land and be indoctrinated and become terrorists in the future,” he said.
