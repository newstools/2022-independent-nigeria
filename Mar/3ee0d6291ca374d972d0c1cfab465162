The terrorists who attacked the Abuja-Kaduna bound train on Monday night have reportedly called the families of the victim abducted in the process of the attack to get prepared for ransom. Daily Independent had reported that some gunmen suspected to be terrorists bombed the Abuja-Ka­duna rail tracks and attacked a train filled with 362 passengers, leaving many dead, sever­al injured and others abducted. Confirming the terrorists’ call, some of the victim’s relatives who spoke to the Daily Post on Thursday said that they received phone calls on Wednesday evening, telling them not to panic over the disappearance of their loved ones, assuring them of their safety, but that they should be ready for their calls for ransom. Musa Abilewa, a family member of one of the kidnapped victims, said the terrorists spoke with him, saying his brother is fine, adding that the bandits said he should be ready for ransom. He said, “I spoke with one of the bandits who said my brother was fine. He said I should be ready to pay for feeding my brother since he was kidnapped.” Mrs Ngozi, another relative of the abducted victim who said he was discharged from the hospital in Kaduna on Thursday, said the only sister in the family was among those kidnapped. Speaking, she said, “they called me while I am about to be discharged from hospital bed early morning on Wednesday. I spoke with my sister too, who said I should try all I could, to pay, if they demand for ransom.” “Though I did not speak with my mother, my sister assured me she is fine,” he said. POLL Another family member, Yahaya Abdul also said the bandits called him and told him his brother was fine and that he should expect their call.
