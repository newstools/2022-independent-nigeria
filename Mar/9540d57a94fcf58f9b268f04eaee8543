It has been reported that bandits, on Saturday, stormed the Kaduna International Airport, stopping an aircraft from taking off. It was gathered that the aircraft, which was billed to take off at 12.30pm, could not proceed due to the presence of the heavily-armed bandits around the runway of the airport. It was also gathered that hoodlums, who stormed the runaway, forced officials of the airline and passengers to run for safety. It was also learnt that bandits killed a staff of the Nigerian Airspace Management Agency (NAMA). ‘’As I speak to you now, there is already a military presence to beef up security, though most of the staff are scared with the killing of the NAMA staff,” a source said. As at the time of filing this report, security agencies at the airport were yet to react to the incident. More to come.
