LAGOS – Coach Otto Addohas ruled out the notion that Nigeria are the favourites to win the second leg of the 2022 World Cup playoff between thetwocountriesonTuesday. This is as he has expressed the hope that the four times African champions, Ghana, would beat Nigeria to the ticket right at the MKO Abiola Stadium in Abuja on Tuesday. But popular opinions have given Nigeria the favourites tag afterholdingGhanatoagoalless draw in the first leg at the Baba Yara Stadium in Kumasi. The Super Eagles defended well in front of a large crowd on Friday and are expected to beat Black Stars in front of expected huge crowd at the Moshood Abiola National Stadium. Nigeria need a win while Ghana would advance with a win or a scoring draw but Ciach Addo said the first leg result does not change anything regarding who should be favourite to win the ticket. “The result doesn’t change anything. When we go there we want to win. “Even though our Africa Cup of Nations was not good this year, you saw we matched Nigeria in the first leg,” said the former Black Star player. “So I don’t see them as favourites, the pressure will be on them at home and away goals can hurt a lot.”
