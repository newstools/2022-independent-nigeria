Osun State Governor, Adegboyega Oyetola, has expressed confidence of his administration in the emergence of former Deputy Governor of the state, Senator Christopher Iyiola Omisore, as National Secretary of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), saying he has the capacity to advance the party’s course. Oyetola, who spoke shortly after the announcement of Omisore as National Secretary of APC, also congratulated the National Chairman of the party and former Governor of Nasarawa State, Senator Abdullahi Adamu and other members of the National Working Committee of the party. While describing his emergence as a right peg in a round hole, Oyetola noted that Omisore would bring his wealth of experience to bear in the administration and management of the party’s affairs. It would be recalled that Omisore assisted Governor Oyetola in becoming Osun State Governor. This was after the Independent National Electoral Commission declared the September 22, 2018 governorship election inconclusive on the ground that the 353 votes margin between Ademola Adeleke and Oyetola was lower than the number of cancelled votes (3,498) in seven polling units, which fell in Omisore’s stronghold.
