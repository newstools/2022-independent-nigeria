Governor of Lagos State, Babajide Sanwo-Olu, has claimed the Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) that the late Oluwabamishe Ayanwole boarded, was locally supplied and has no inbuilt camera. On February 26, Oluwabamise closed from work and was on her way to visit her brother, Pelumi, when she boarded the bus around Chevron Bus-stop in the Lekki area of the state. The 22-year-old was, however, ‘murdered’ inside the vehicle.

Sanwo-Olu has assured that investigations are ongoing and explained that the particular bus boarded by Bamise had no inbuilt camera. He stated this while briefing reporters on Tuesday at the Mobolaji Johnson Arena in Onikan to commemorate International Women’s Day. “There were inbuilt cameras and trackers in buses procured abroad for BRT operations. But those acquired locally to shore up the BRT fleet did not have cameras. “The particular bus in which the slain victim rode was one of the buses locally supplied,” a statement signed by Sanwo-Olu’s spokesman, Gboyega Akosile, read.
