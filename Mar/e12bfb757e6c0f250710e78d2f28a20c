Former Governor of Gombe State, Ibrahim Hassan Dankwambo alongside the Governor of Rivers State, Nyesom Wike and former Ekiti State Governor, Ayo Fayose on Saturday visited Sen. Danjuma Goje at his Abuja residence to woo him back to the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) ahead of the 2023 general election. Senator Goje, a former Minister of Power, was also a two times governor of Gombe State between 2003 to 2011 under the PDP before he was succeeded by Ibrahim Dankwambo. But during the build0up of the 2015 general election, the third time Senator representing Gombe Central Senatorial District, Goje decamped to the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC). in a bid to woo Goje back to the opposition party, the trio held a closed-door meeting with the elder statesman in his residence in Asokoro to convince him to return back to the PDP. Other delegates at the meeting to ostensibly lobby Goje are Senate Deputy minority leader, Sen. Philip Aduda and former member of the house of Representatives, JC.
