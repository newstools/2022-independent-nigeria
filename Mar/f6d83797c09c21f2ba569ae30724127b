LAGOS – Ahead of next week’s first leg of the dual 2022 World Cup qualifying playoff between Ghana and Nigeria at the Baba Yara Stadium in Kumasi, the Video Assistant Referee (VAR) gadgets have been brought to the stadium for installation. Recall that the equipment was one of the conditions advanced by CAF for the stadium to host the match and according to a report from local media, the gadgets have arrived at the arena. The Baba Yara Sports Stadium was given the green light to host the game between the West African giants after the Cape Coast Stadium was rejected by CAF officials. The inspection team’s confirmation of the Baba Yara Stadium necessitated the arrival of the equipment for the installation of the Video Assistant Referee. All playoff matches on the continent will have VAR. Until Wednesday, March 16 Ghana did not have a home venue to host the first leg. CAF had to send a special team to inspect Baba Yara Stadium before it was approved. The Cape Coast Stadium, originally set to host the game, was rejected by CAF after pictures emerged of the pitch in terrible condition after the 65th Independence Anniversary Parade. Baba Yara Stadium has been approved but a lot must be done within 10 days, as stated by CAF in their letter to the GFA.
