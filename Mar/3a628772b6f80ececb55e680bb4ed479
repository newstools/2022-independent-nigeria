Lagos – Ghana’s Black Stars have been handed a big boost with the return of Orlando Pirates goalkeeper, Richard Ofori, ahead of the 2022 World Cup playoffs against the Super Eagles of Nigeria later this month. The deputy Black Stars captain returned to the team after a long injury lay-off, which saw him miss the 2021 Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) tournament in Cameroon. Daily Independent learnt that Ofori on his injury return has reclaimed the number one spot at his club Orlando Pirates and was in post for the Confederation of Africa Football (CAF) Confederation Cup game against Royal Leopards on Sunday. The South African giants won the game 3-0 with Ofori keeping a clean sheet. Meanwhile, ahead of the World Cup playoffs against Nigeria next week, Orlando Pirates head coach Mandla Ncikazi has confirmed that Richard Ofori has been invited to the Black Stars of Ghana team for the crucial first and second leg games against Nigeria. His return, however, will bring a lot of competition to the goalkeeping department, as he has to compete with Jojo Wollacot for the first choice goalkeeper. Ofori was last in post for the Black Stars during the 2022 FIFA World Cup qualifier against the Bafana Bafana of South Africa in Johannesburg.
