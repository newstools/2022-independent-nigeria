Mauricio Pochettino has not asked to leave Paris Saint-Germain amid Manchester United’s interest in the manager. That’s according to PSG director Leonardo, who also made it clear that the club were not looking to change their man in the hot seat. United are in the hunt for a new permanent replacement for Ole Gunnar Solskjaer to take over the reins from interim manager Ralf Rangnick in the summer. The Manchester Evening News reported in January that United hoped to have their new boss in place before the end of the season. Pochettino and Ajax’s Erik ten Hag are the leading candidates.

It has been heavily speculated that the Parisians may look to bring in Zinedine Zidane to pave the way for Pochettino’s departure but those rumours have now been denied. “We’ve never thought about changing our manager. We’ve never contacted Zidane or anyone,” Leonardo told L’Equipe. “I can say that Mauricio Pochettino has never asked to leave. I have no problem with him. We talk about everything”.
