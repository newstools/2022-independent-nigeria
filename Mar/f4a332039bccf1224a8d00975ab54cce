The Russian air strikes on the western Ukrainian city of Lviv today were intended to send a message to US President Joe Biden, mayor Andriy Sadovyy says. He’s been speaking at a joint briefing with the head of the Lviv military civil administration, Maksym Kozytskyy, broadcast on YouTube. “I think that, with today’s strikes, the aggressor is sending greetings to President Biden, who is in Poland now. Lviv is 70 km away from Poland,” Sadovyy says. “I think the whole world should realise that the threat is extremely serious.” Kozytskyy says the missiles hit two critical infrastructure facilities, one of which was an oil depot in a residential area in Lviv, and another was a military plant also located in a residential area. Each of them was targeted by two missile attacks, he says. No-one was killed, Kozytskyy adds, but five people sought medical help.
