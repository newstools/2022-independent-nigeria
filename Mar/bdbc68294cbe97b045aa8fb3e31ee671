OSOGBO  – The battle for the soul of Peo­ples Democratic Party in Osun State has assumed a new twist as the clash has been shifted to court for settlement. An investigation conducted by Saturday INDEPENDENT revealed that the factional camp loyal to Prince Dotun Babayemi who emerged as candidate from another camp of the party has approached the court. It would be recalled that two candidates emerged winners at parallel governorship primary election conducted on the plat­form of PDP in the state.

Despite that the certificate of return has been given to Senator Ademola Adeleke in Abuja, the factional governor­ship candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Prince Dotun Babayemi says it doesn’t affirm his position as the party’s candidate in the July 18 election in the state. But the National leadership of the party-backed Ademola Adeleke’s faction and Dr. Iyor­chia Ayu presented Adeleke the certificate of return at the national secretariat of the par­ty in Abuja.
