Reality TV star, Tega Dominic, has admitted that her marriage to for­mer husband, Kris Law­rence Ajeboh, had actually broken down below her so­journ in the reality show last year. The former BBNaija “Shine Ya Eye” housemate explained that her marriage to Ajeboh crashed in 2020 before she went on the real­ity show. While on the show, Tega was romantically entangled with another housemate, Boma, despite being mar­ried. Her action elicited a backlash from the public and she was forced to apol­ogise to her fans and her husband. But Tega made her mar­ital status prior to the show known in a question and an­swer session with fans via her insta stories on Friday. “Stop hanging on the re­port mama T, are you still married? I will keep ask­ing till you respond,” a fan quizzed. The mother of one re­plied: “Lol. No, I am not, ended since 2020. All you know is a move that went wrong. Actually, it ended in 2020. Now y’all can get off my back, tenks.” Another very curious fan pointed out: “You said your marriage ended in 2020 but there’s a picture of you two kissing in 2021.” POLL Responding sarcastically, the 29-year-old media per­sonality wrote: “Na you sabi o as you no get eye, I can’t help you.” Last week, Tega Domi­nic flagged a debate online when she called on the or­ganisers of the TV reality show to consider canceling this year’s edition of the re­union. She made the suggestion in a live Instagram session, where she stressed the need to skip the reunion for the ‘Shine Ya Eye’ edition housemates because it will be boring. The reunion is a TV show, which takes place after each edition, ex-housemates of Africa’s biggest reality show, are brought together to talk about everything that transpired during their stay in the house. According to the mother of one, there is no need for one this year because her set was the most peaceful, and for that, there won’t be anything interesting to talk about at the reunion show.
