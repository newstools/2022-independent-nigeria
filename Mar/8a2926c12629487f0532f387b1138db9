It’s the universal month of women, and this entire month, StyleMania is highlighting some of the women doing great things in diverse sectors. As part of the celebrations for the month, we believe that it is important to recognise the ladies who are not only doing great things but are the epitome of stylish excellence, just like Omolara Svensson, GMD OOK Farms. But before that, here are a few style options, straight from the Nigerian entertainment industry that are guaranteed to brighten your day and help you embrace your inner femininity. Cheers StyleManiacs!
