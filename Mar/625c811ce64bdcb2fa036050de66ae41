Consolidated Hallmark Insurance (CHI) Plc, has paid accident claims of a member of the National Association of Insurance and Pension Correspondents (NAIPCO), who had an incident recently. The insurance firm, had, in October, renewed the Group Personal Accident Insurance cover worth N24 million Sum Assured given for free to insurance journalists in the country. The said member was crossing the road when a motorcycle riding against traffic hit her from behind which led to her being hospitalised. However, covered under the free group personal accident cover issued to NAIPCO, CHI stepped in to pay the hospital bills of the member while the victim has been discharged from the hospital and she now in good health. This gesture, according to the company, is part of its Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) project, to ensure that journalists who are exposed to danger and hazard in the discharge of their civic duties are adequately protected. Mr. Eddie Efekoha, the Group Managing Director/CEO, CHI, while reacting to this development, said, this gesture is to show the kind of values and respect his insurance firm has for journalism, believing, journalists, who are the shaper of the society, and by extension, the insurance industry, must be protected. Journalism, he said, is a risky profession, hence, the need to adequately provide insurance for those covering the insurance industry. Applauding the initiative, Mr. Chuks Udo Okonta, the chairman, National Association of Insurance and Pension Correspondents (NAIPCO), thanked the insurance firm on the claims it paid, stating that, this is a testimony that insurance works and that insurers are actually paying genuine claims. POLL He applauded the insurer for its prompt response to the claim request, pointing out that, the company was cooperative throughout the claim processing. Okonta also noted that similar claim was paid to a member who was involved in an accident in the past.
