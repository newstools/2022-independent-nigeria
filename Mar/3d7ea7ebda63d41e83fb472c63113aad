LAGOS – Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) chieftain, Chief Emeka Kalu, has called for equity and balanced leadership in picking who will be the next governor of Abia State. Kalu, National Coordinator, People’s Democratic Party Coalition (PDPCO), who spoke through a statement at the weekend, lamented the ongoing mudslinging and distortions trending in Abia State as certain politicians plan to scuttle the long sustained peace in the land by insisting that power should remain in their area without considering the feelings of other. Kalu maintained that former Governor Theodore Orji had stressed the need for a governorship position to return to Abia North, lamenting that such a rotational arrangement meant for peace, was being attacked and rebuffed by those he described as “haters of equity and justice”. According to him, it would be disastrous for Abia State if the long-standing rotational arrangement would be truncated, as it could distort the existing peace in the state as the nation marches towards the 2023 general election. He stated: “This is why it is dangerous to truncate the components of equity in our human society and it calls that men be guided in their words and actions. “Democracy as eminently held, defined and interpreted is seen as the government of the people, by the people and for the people, while equity is the sustaining nutrients through which democracy survives. “Political power tussles never contribute to the economic advancement of any nation, rather it carelessly grows the seed of unhealthy rivalry, ethnic acrimony and marginalisation, which is the bane of our present-day Nigeria.”
