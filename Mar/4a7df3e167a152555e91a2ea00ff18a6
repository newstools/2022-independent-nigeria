Nestoil marked the 2022 International Women’s Day with a stimulating engagement with elite ladies making themselves proud in business and career in the Nigerian economy. The virtual gathering, which had about 50 in attendance, including men, had select women who had broken the glass ceiling in their chosen fields lead conversations with a view to encouraging others, motivating the young to aspire and debunking the notion of gender stigmatisation. The 2022 Nestoil Group International Women’s Day event held under the theme, ‘’#BreaktheBias: Gender Equality Today for a Sustainable Tomorrow.” During the event, speakers explored the implications of gender bias in the workplace and charged fellow women to be ambitious, focused, deliberately competent and willing to put in the extra work as necessary ingredients to breaking the glass ceiling. Nwamaka Onyemelukwe, Director, Public Affairs, Communications and Sustainability, Coca-Cola Nigeria, opined that for women to break the bias, they must be ready to purge themselves of stereotypical beliefs and embrace life with a positive mindset. According to Onyemelukwe, one of the stereotypes that hold women back is the lack of conviction which prevents women from pursuing opportunities for which they are qualified . Whereas the menfolk, even those with lower qualifications, are often undeterred in going for every available opportunity. Onyemelukwe charged women to cultivate the habit of self-belief because there is no limit to what they can achieve if they do. She said, “Women account for two-thirds of the world’s spending power; 66 per cent of work is done by women, yet they earn 10 per cent of the world’s income due to the type of work they do. By being more deliberate in creating value, mentoring other ladies and girls, while not forgetting to grow their network, more women will be empowered to break the bias and rise to the top.”
