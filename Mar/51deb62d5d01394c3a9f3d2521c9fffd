ABUJA – Miscreants and scavengers’ camp at Nyanya, on the outskirts of Abuja, was dismantled by the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) Ministerial Taskforce Team on City Sanitation. Kaka Bello, the Head, Monitoring and Enforcement, Abuja Environmental Protection Board, who led the demolition crew on Thursday, said the tents were removed due to many insecurity issues in the place. He explained that the experiment was motivated by the necessity to keep the federal capital territory, particularly the suburbs, sane. According to him, the scavengers were told to leave the area some weeks ago, but they ignored the orders. Bello, who described the area as a scavenger colony, noted that despite the FCT’s best efforts, the situation has not improved as hoodlums still muster the courage to stay. He, however, regretted the continued illegal activities of the scavengers in most of the suburbs and warned them to steer clear of areas that are not allocated to them. Bello, therefore, called on some of the residents liaising with scavengers to desist from it, as the situation will give them more courage. POLL “The exercise is about city cleaning and sanitation, this is a colony of scavengers which we have removed several times, but they still return. “Weeks ago we came here to tell them about the need to vacate this area, or else we will come and carry out an enforcement, and unfortunately while some of them comply others refused to comply, but we won’t be discouraged by the miscreants and scavengers refusal to heed to the taskforce team orders” Bello said.
