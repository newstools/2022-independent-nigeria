Abuja – The Peoples Democratic Party’s (PDP) governors have thrown light on why the nation is in total darkness overtime. The governors disclosed how the national grid collapsed 126 times in seven years. The governors, under the aegis of PDP Governors’ Forum, in their communiqué after their meeting in Aba, Abia State, said, “The collapse of the national grid 126 times in seven years (June 2015 to March 2022) and its consequences for non-availability of power is most unfortunate.” The governors, in their meeting reviewed the excruciating hardship and suffering meted out to Nigerians by the APC-led Federal Government. They also reviewed the near collapse of the APC as a viable political party, the readiness of the PDP to take over and offer qualitative leadership options to rescue the nation. The communiqué read: “We lament the terrible pain and hardship facing Nigerians in virtually all aspects of life. The meeting noted that life was much better in 2015 under the PDP than today under the APC as exemplified in the following comparative indicators obtained mainly from the National Bureau of Statistics: “Prices of basic food stuffs are now three times higher than what they used to be in 2015. Staple foods such as rice, beans, cassava flakes are now slipping out of the hands of average Nigerians. Indeed, a bag of rice sold for N8,500 in 2015 is now N39,000. “Electricity was N14.23 per kilowatt in 2015, it is now N38.530, and not even available. “Unemployment rate was 11.4% in 2015, it is now over 33%, one the highest in the world. POLL “The poverty rate in 2015 was 11.3% but now about 42.8%. Accumulated Inflation in 2015 was about 4%, it is now 15.50%; inflation rate was 9.01% in 2015 and now 15.7%. “Perhaps, the exchange rate has been one of the most disastrous. N150 to a dollar was the parallel market (patronised by most businessmen and Nigerians) rate in 2015, it is now about N580 to $1 in the parallel market and still rising.” Speaking on debt and debt servicing, the governors said, “Domestic debt of N8.4 trillion and external debt of USD7.3 billion was incurred between 1999-2015. “While domestic debt of N7.63 trillion (June 2015-Dec 2020) and USD28.57 billion as at Dec 2020 was incurred. External debt of USD21.27 billion was incurred between June 2015 and 2021. “National debt to GDP ratio was 23.41% (2016), it is now 36.88% (2022). The corruption index has risen from 136 in 2015 to 150 now. “Nigeria’s misery index, an indicator used in determining how economically well off the citizens of a country are, is usually calculated by adding the seasonally adjusted unemployment rate to the annual inflation rate, has moved from 14.75 percent in 2015 to 50.48 (2021).” Lamenting how insecurity has taken a toll on agriculture, the governors said, “The major threat to the agricultural sector and food security in Nigeria is insecurity. In the North-East of Nigeria, it is estimated that no fewer than 70,000 hectares of arable farmland have been abandoned in the affected states and local government areas. “The trend is the same all over the country. This further contributes to food inflation. The APC led Federal Government must take steps to cooperate with states to bring security down to the grassroots. “The Forum is surprised that in the face of these statistics of complete failure in all ramifications and areas, the APC still wants to be on the ballot in 2023.” The governors said that the failure of this government shows how uncaring and insensitive the APC is, adding that it has become a menace to Nigeria. The governors, have, however, urged Nigerians to reject the APC, describing it as a party run undemocratically by a committee contrary to the constitution (S.228) with Mr. President regularly issuing instructions and dictates. “It is impossible for a party so disorganised to offer good governance to the people of Nigeria,” the Governors’ Forum said.
