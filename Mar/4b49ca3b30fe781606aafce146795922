A chieftain of the All Progressives Congress (APC) and North Central Coordinator, Tinubu Support Organisation (TSO), Mallam Abdulazeez Yinka-Oniyangi, has described the recent revolts in the political camp of the National Leader of the APC, Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu (BAT), as a test of leadership. Oniyangi, the Chief Executive Officer (CEO), Swift Air Ambulance Services, in a chat with DAILY INDEPENDENT in Abuja disclosed that the revolts by some Tinubu’s former aides and foot soldiers against his presidential ambition were not unexpected after all, saying,  “It is a test of leadership  and everybody cannot be on the same page with the ex Lagos Governor.” The TSO chieftain who expressed joy that majority of Nigerians aligned with Tinubu’s Presidential ambition, however, described the revolts as mere distractions. The pro-Tinubu activist cautioned that “Tinubu’s reaction and response to all these would be a step towards his leadership quality. I am glad Tinubu is focused on his political aspiration.” Oniyangi stated further, “If you have to be successful in life, the enemy starts from within and not from outside. Even when you look at it from the spiritual angle, the stories of Prophet Muhammad (SAW) and Jesus Christ are full of betrayals and traitors. “So, it’s normal to have such negative tendencies. But for me, it’s part of the test of leadership. So Tinubu’s reaction and response to all these would be a step towards his leadership quality. But I am glad Tinubu is focused on his political aspiration.”
