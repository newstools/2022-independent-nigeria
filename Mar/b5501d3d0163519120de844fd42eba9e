Iran believes a deal on its nuclear programme can be quickly reached if Washington accepts points made by Tehran at talks in Vienna, the Islamic Republic’s foreign ministry said on Monday, adding that Russia’s contribution to negotiations so far had been constructive. The talks, which aim to revive a 2015 agreement between Iran and western powers, have become mired in uncertainty following a demand from Russia for a US guarantee that the sanctions that Moscow faces over the Ukraine invasion would not hurt its trade with Iran. Iranian foreign ministry spokesperson Saeed Khatibzadeh said a deal can be reached in “the shortest time” with US approval of Tehran’s stance.
