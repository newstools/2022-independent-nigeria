Dr. Ogbonnaya Orji, noted that compared to the N2.6Trillion owed in 2019 the revenues recorded a dip by 40 percent within the year under review, adding that the number of defaulting companies dropped from 77 reported by NEITI in 2019 to 51 in 2020. The NEITI boss described the current debts as collectable revenues that are due to the Federation by the Department of Petroleum Resources and the Federal Inland Revenue Service, stressing that the latest reports outlined the specific revenue streams that accounted for the liabilities in question. “These include royalty oil, royalty gas, concession rentals, Petroleum Profit Tax, Company Income Tax, Education tax, Value Added Tax, Withholding Tax among others. POLL “The courageous public disclosure of companies’ liabilities to the Federation by NEITI was in line with its national mandate and in fulfilment of its obligation as a member of the global Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI), and not in any way against the companies. ”NEITI’s disclosure seeks to draw the attention of the oil and gas companies to their obligations to remit all revenues due to government, especially at this time that government is in dire need of revenues to rebuild the nation’s infrastructure and improve the investment climate in the country” Dr. Orji explained. Dr Orji described the companies as the backbone of the industry. “Without the companies there will be no industry, no investments and no revenues to remit”. So NEITI will continue to support the companies and also expect that they live up to their obligations, as regard to payment of taxes, royalties and levies to the Federation, as they do in other jurisdictions of their operations. The NEITI 2020 oil and gas report also revealed that Nigeria earned $20.43billion from the oil and gas sector in 2020.
