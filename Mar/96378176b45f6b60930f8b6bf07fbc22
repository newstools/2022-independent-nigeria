Nigerian media personality, Ifedayo Olarinde, popularly known as Daddy Freeze, has urged entertainers not to shy from performing for politicians ahead of the 2023 general elections. He disclosed this on Saturday in a post via his Instagram page, expressing that PVC and voting are the things that can guarantee election victory not artiste performance. The broadcaster wrote, “Dear Nigerian musicians and actors  (both gospel and secular), MCs, DJs, radio/tv presenters etc. I don’t see why you can’t perform at political events and interview political candidate, you are simply doing your job and earning your livelihood. PVC and voting is what guarantees election victory not artiste performance. Also remember that if you don’t want to be a hypocrite, don’t clamp down on artistes alone, remember to include caterers, event venue owners, drink suppliers, ushers, security personnel etc. at the events. “I included the Gospel acts because in Nigeria, gospel is not a calling, rather a business; unless we want to lie to ourselves. Personally, I will interview any political leader who wants to use my services or my platform, at my current going rate; plus the surcharge for political events/candidates. “Don’t let anyone use emotional blackm@il on you, but also remember to do your job as professionally as possible keep it professional. Interviewing a candidate or performing at an event is different from endorsement, know the difference.Earn your pay, Nigeria is already hard enough! ~FRZ”
