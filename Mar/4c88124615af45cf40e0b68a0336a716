David de Gea has admitted he is happy to see Jadon Sancho and Anthony Elanga in contention to win the Manchester United Player of the Month award for February. The duo enjoyed a highly productive month, scoring four goals and grabbing two assists between them, thriving out wide for United. Sancho scored against Middlesbrough and Southampton and claimed two assists in the 4-2 triumph over Leeds, while Elanga netted against Leeds and in the Wanda Metropolitano against Atletico Madrid. Both players have gone from strength-to-strength in recent weeks under Ralf Rangnick. Sancho, after a slow start to life at Old Trafford, showed signs of encouragement throughout February and has made the left-flank his own in recent weeks.
