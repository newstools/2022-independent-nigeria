ABAKAIKI – A group, the Citizens Democratic Movement, has alleged that the court ruling against Governor David Umahi of Ebonyi State was a ploy to destabilize the All Progressives Congress (APC). The group said that the Governor Umahi saga could be a test ground to claim many States where APC has stronghold. Chairman of the group, Chief Emmanuel Igwe in a press release issued yesterday said that the group was not unaware of certain clandestine meetings where the unfolding plots might have been hatched. They urged Nigerians not to see the Umahi matter as a one-off plan, noting that three other Governors of APC were lined up for similar smear. They said that truncation of the incumbent administration in Ebonyi State in the manner that is being hatched can inflict dangerous security threat to Ebonyi State, and extend to others. “We lost the lives of four sons of the Ebonyi State in the last political fight.We cannot afford the same scenarios again,” the document stated. “We have in the recent past suffered deaths and crises caused by political crises between Abuja Group and the home based political key players in Ebonyi State. We acknowledge that the law is for the people and not the other way round. For the reason that Umahi has appealed the judgement against him and his Deputy, Dr. Eric Igwe, we should allow the law to peacefully go through the Appeal Court to the Supreme Court”.
