The General Overseer of the Living Faith Church, also known as Winners Chapel Worldwide, Bishop David Oyedepo on Saturday revealed why he celebrates his birthdays just once in ten years. Speaking during a sermon, Oyedepo revealed that he lacks the time to celebrate his birthday annually and that he usually forgets his birthdays due to activities. The 67-year-old gospel preacher said that to attain great height, one must focus on hard work, stressing that only hard workers fly higher in the race of life. According to him, he celebrated his last birthday on September 27, 2021. “For lack of time, I can only celebrate a birthday once in ten years. Any other day that you greet me regarding your birthday, you are on your own. “Only hard workers emerge as high fliers in the race of life. People are so lazy today that food is their uppermost priority. They sit down around food as if it is their enthronement”.
