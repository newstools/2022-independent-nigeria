Gary Lineker and Jude Bellingham were full of praise for Jadon Sancho, after he temporarily drew Manchester United level against Manchester City. Trailing 1-0 to an early Kevin De Bruyne goal, United moved the ball quickly as they counterattacked at pace, with Bruno Fernandes and Paul Pogba combining brilliantly to set up Sancho on the left. The England international received the ball at the edge of the box, took on and easily beat Kyle Walker, before burying his shot past Ederson in the bottom far corner.

Bellingham, who played alongside Sancho at Borussia Dortmund last season, was full of praise for his former teammate. ‘JS, big game player,’ the England international tweeted, while Usain Bolt also gushed over the finish. Sancho’s celebration was largely subdued, perhaps owing to the fact he was on City’s books before leaving for Dortmund in 2017. ‘Jadon Sancho, he is one of our own,’ tweeted Scott Patterson of the popular Republik of Mancunia blog. POLL The 21-year-old, however, never made a senior appearance for City, as other Twitter users noted. ‘Sancho’s celebration kills me, apologising to his old club that he made 0 caps for and they also happen to be his new clubs biggest rival,’ tweeted Ossdeux. Sancho moved to Old Trafford for £76million in the summer, following a protracted transfer saga in the summer of 2020 ended with him remaining at Dortmund. After a slow start to his United career, the England international’s form has steadily improved and he has scored twice and provided two assists in the last five Premier League games. His goal on Sunday, however, ultimately proved meaningless as United were outclassed by their local rivals in a 4-1 hammering.
