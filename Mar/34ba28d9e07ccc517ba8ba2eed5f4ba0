ABUJA – The Senate on Tuesday asked security agencies in the country to be more proactive in against insurgents, kidnappers and terrorists; and in protecting the lives of citizens. The Deputy President of the Senate, Senator Ovie Omo-Agege, made the call following a point of order raised by the Deputy Whip, Senator Aliyu Sabi Abdullahi (APC, Niger North). While commending the swift intervention of security agencies, Senator Omo-Agege said, “it is clear that they’ve done their best, we are not unmindful of that. “They were able to come back with a reprisal to take them out. “We would have wished that they took a proactive action, and not an action coming after lives have been lost. Be that as it may, we will continue to encourage security agencies to do all they can to police as much of our territory, especially in Niger State, which is about one of the largest land mass we have in this country.” In his presentation on the insecurity in Niger State, the Lawmaker who rose on Order 42, lamented that bandits in large number from Zamfara State, attacked a Police Station at Nasko town in Magama Local Government Area of the State. A situation he said led to the death of the Divisional Police Officer, some Policemen and residents during the attack on the town. POLL The Senate, thereafter, held a minute silence to mourn those killed by the bandits in Magama Local Government Area of Niger State.
