Awka –  Uzuegbunam Okagbue, deputy Chief of Staff to former governor Willie Onion of Anambra State, says Anambra- Central Senatorial zone is poorly represented at the Senate. Okagbue, who has declared his intention to be in the 10th Senate come 2023, said he remains the best person to represent Anambra-Central Senatorial District because he believes that in both personal and professional capacities, he does things differently. He said, “I have heard those who feel challenged by our entrance in the race attempt to mock our youthfulness by declaring that the Senate is not for beginners. “While I am young and proud of my youthfulness, I dare say that I am not a beginner. I have spent the last 16 years from age 28 preparing myself for this task. Eight years in the private sector and eight productive years of being a gatekeeper to ex-governor Willie Obiano carries a lifetime of experience in public service.
