AKURE – A splinter group within the All Progressives Congress (APC), Integrity Group, Ondo State Chapter, has condemned the alleged move by Governor Oluwarotimi Akeredolu to impose his preferred candidate for position at the party’s national executive. In a statement signed by the coordinator of the group, Mr. Obakunle Isijola, on Monday, the group queried the constitutional right of the governor to unilaterally nominate a candidate for the party. It stated that it would not ignore the alleged autocratic tendencies of the governor, saying “If you have submitted your right, some other persons have not. “The same governor who did not fight for us since 2014 to have substantial party positions or good appointments at federal level is now usurping power to nominate party positions. “How can Ondo State prefer vice chairmanship to secretaryship of our great party? When other Yoruba states got senior ministers in both first and second terms of President Muhammadu Buhari- led government, what position did our brothers or sister states take to defend us?
