IBADAN – Ladoke Akintola University of Technology (LAUTECH), Ogbomoso Alumni Association, has expressed its displeasure over the plan by Governor of Oyo State, Seyi Makinde, to rename the institution. The alumni association explained that thousands of graduates of the institution would suffer in their workplaces if the governor goes ahead to rename the institution. Months after attaining sole ownership, the Oyo State government, led by Governor Seyi Makinde, decided to rename the institution from Ladoke Akintola University of Technology (LAUTECH) to Ladoke Akintola University (LAU). The Bill to change the current status of the 32-year-old ivory tower from a technical institution to a conventional university sailed through second reading in the Oyo State House of Assembly on Tuesday. Recall that Governor Makinde officially wrote to the House, requesting for the changing of the status of the university.
