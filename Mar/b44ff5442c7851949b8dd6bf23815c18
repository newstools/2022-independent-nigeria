The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) has granted former governor of Anambra, Willie Obiano, administrative bail. The EFCC Chairman, Abdulrasheed Bawa, disclosed this while fielding questions from newsmen at the 5th Annual General Assembly of the Network of National Anti-corruption institutions in West Africa (NACIWA) in Abuja on Monday. According to Bawa, the former governor was still in its custody since he had yet to meet his bail conditions. “Although, he has been granted bail and we are waiting for him to perfect his bail conditions. So far, he has been cooperating with us and everything is going on well,” he said. “There is nothing political about the investigation. You know what the EFCC stands for. “We investigate crimes, we look at people that have committed a crime and we link it up together and then we go to court. That is all we have been doing and that is what we will continue to do. “We have been accused of media trial. But we will continue to do our investigations professionally,” Bawa added. Meanwhile, an operative of EFCC, who leaked the video of former Willie Obiano while being questioned in its custody has been apprehended. POLL The commission disclosed this in a statement by its spokesman, Wilson Uwujaren, on Monday. The statement read, “The attention of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission has been drawn to a trending video showing the former governor of Anambra State, Chief Willie Obiano, in the custody of the commission. “The commission wishes to distance itself from the said video which is completely at variance with the established standard operating procedure of the EFCC. “A discreet investigation ordered upon discovery of the leak has revealed the errant officer behind the odious act and he is currently being subjected to appropriate disciplinary action.” Recall that a short video of former Anambra Governor Willie Obiano in the EFFC’s detention discussing with an unidentified person surfaced online on Sunday.
