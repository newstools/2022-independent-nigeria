Poland is calling for European Union countries to impose a total ban on trade with Russia, urging tougher sanctions on Moscow for its invasion of Ukraine. Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki said on Saturday that a trade block and ban on land trade would force Russia to consider ending its war on Ukraine. “Poland is proposing to add a trade blockade to this package of sanctions as soon as possible, (including) both of its seaports… but also a ban on land trade. Fully cutting off Russia’s trade would further force Russia to consider whether it would be better to stop this cruel war,” Mr Morawiecki said. Earlier this week EU member states agreed on a fourth package of sanctions against Russia. Details were not disclosed, but the French presidency said Russia’s “most-favoured nation” trade status would be revoked. These include a ban on any transactions with specific Russian State-owned enterprises across different sectors; steel products currently under EU safeguard measures; export of luxury goods and investment across the Russian energy sector. It comes after a growing number of international companies including McDonald’s, Coca-Cola and Starbucks have suspended trading in Russia, along with Visa and Mastercard. The EU is also considering creating a solidarity fund for Ukraine to help provide basic services in the country and meet citizens’ immediate needs. Ukraine has been cut off from international financial markets due to the Russian invasion and the fund could give it enough financial support to keep government services running, continue defence efforts provide basic services. POLL European Council President Charles Michel said on Friday: “The Fund would give liquidity for continued support to authorities and in the longer term serve as the backbone for the reconstruction of a free and democratic Ukraine once hostilities stop.”
