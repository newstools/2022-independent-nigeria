ABUJA – Chaos has greeted the Eagle Square, venue of the All Progressives Congress (APC), national convention in Abuja as political thugs loyal to different politicians have beseeched the non-security entrance leading to the premises. The DAILY INDEPENDENT correspondent who witnessed the scenes first-hand reports that human traffic was diverted from the main entrance which was restricted to non VIPs, forcing some non-statutory delegates and accredited journalists to use the inner gate through the car park of the Federal Secretariat. However, on getting there, political thugs who obviously experienced the same diversion and directive to use the inner gate throng the place in their numbers as they overwhelmed security guards at the entrance. Following the chaos that almost brought metal barriers down, many of them including some tag-wielding delegates and journalists managed to gain entry amid stampede. It took some reinforcement from by-standing security operatives to regain control of the situation. Having brought the chaos under control, the visibly angry police operatives charged at the waiting crowd with heavy bombardment of teargas just to disperse them. The highly fouled air led to another round of stampede as the remaining thugs, banners-wielding supporters, delegates, as well as journalists took to their heels in search of a cover from the teargas. Whether the operatives will be able to institute order in the movement of people in and out of the convention venue still remains to be seen. POLL As of the time of filing this report, the statutory delegates made up of the President, his Vice, Governors and their Deputies, as well as Federal and State Legislators are yet to arrive the venue.
