Mrs Aisha Mahmud, Commissioner, Consumers Affairs of the Nigerian Electricity Regulatory Commission (NERC), on Wednesday revealed that 17 months after the Federal government approved the National Mass Metering Programme (NMMP), only 622,429 consumers have been metered. This is just as the Managing Director/Chief Executive Officer of the Benin Electricity District Company, PLC, Mrs. Funke Oshibodu has disclosed that the company received over 156,434 complaints from electricity consumers in the four States under its area of coverage in the last two years. The two women spoke in Benin during NERC Customers Complaints/Resolution Meeting. Mrs Mahmud said that one of the biggest challenges facing the electricity sector was metering just as she assured that unmetered consumers will be metered. She said, “It has been reported by the successor distribution companies (DISCOs) that at least four in every ten prepaid meters installed are either bypassed or tampered with by customers, with consequential adverse impact on revenue recovery and financial viability of the industry. ” Unauthorized access, which includes illegal connection, meter bypassing and tampering as well as several other physical methods to evade payment for electricity consumption constitutes a serious crime” On her part, Mrs Oshibodu said that of the 156, 434 complaints received, 154,539 had been disposed of. She disclosed that BEDC has remained one of the best DISCos companies in the training of its staff, saying that since 2019, no fewer than 20,000 staff have undergone various training.
