LAGOS  – Mohammed Anefi, a freight forwarder, has called on the Federal Government to re­vert the Vehicle Identification Number (VIN), policy being implemented by the Nigeria Customs Service (NCS), say­ing the measure would restore normalcy in the Lagos sea­ports and also curb inflation. Recall that the freight forwarders and agents oper­ating in the Lagos seaports have been on protest over the implementation of VIN valu­ation by NCS. The protests crippled ac­tivities in Apapa Port, Tin Can Island Port and PTML, all in Lagos.

The delegation, aftermeeting with stakeholders, promised to take their complaints to the Comptroller General of Cus­toms, retired Col. Hameed Ali. Reacting to the question on what would be the next line of action of the freight forwarders and agents should the Customs fail to reverse the VIN policy, Mohammed, the vice chairman, International Freight Forwarders Associ­ation (IFFA), Ports and Ter­minal Multipurpose Services Limited (PTML), chapter in an interview with Daily In­dependent, said: “Of course, the Customs knows that they must have to revert. If the poli­cy was assigned to them by the Federal Ministry of Finance or whoever must have given them the policy to implement, they just have to reverse it be­cause it will bounce back on the economy.“
