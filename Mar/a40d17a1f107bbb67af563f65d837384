An Abeokuta magistrate court on Monday discharged one of the four teenagers arrested and remanded for killing and burning the head of a girlfriend, Safiyyah Okeowo, for a money ritual. The four teenagers; Balogun Mustakeem, Majekodunmi Soliudeen, Abdulgafa Lukman and Wariz Oladeinde were arraigned and remanded in Oba correctional centre in the Obafemi-Owode local government area for murder. They were arrested on January 28, at Oke-Aregba, Kugba, Abeokuta after killing and severing the skull of Oke-Owo who was a girlfriend of Majekodunmi and remanded since February. Chief Magistrate I.O. Abudu said the 17-year-old Oladeinde was discharged on the legal advice received from the state Director of Public Prosecution. According to the magistrate, no charge was recorded against Oladeinde in the legal advice by the DPP. He said that he based his ruling on the investigation by the police which proved his innocence in the crime. The prosecution had alleged that the four teenagers had conspired to kill Oke-Owo who was a girlfriend to Majekodunmi. But the three others had exonerated Oladeinde on the ground that he was never part of the process. POLL The matter had been adjourned till April 22 for further hearing of the charges against the three teenagers.
