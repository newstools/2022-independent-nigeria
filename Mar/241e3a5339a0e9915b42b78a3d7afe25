MAKURDI – Bandits connected to Late Terwase Akwaza, aka Gana, have teamed up with Fulani herdsmen and allegedly killed three persons at Ankya, Katsina-Ala Local Government Area (LGA) of Benue State. Chairman, Katsina-Ala LGA, Alfred Atera, disclosed this while speaking with newsmen in Makurdi on Wednesday. He said the group killed three persons at Ankya on Tuesday. He, however, also said no casualty was recorded in the Yoyo attack. Atera said, “Yes, that is what they are doing now. Last night (Tuesday night), I heard that the herdsmen went to attack some people in Yoyo. I also learnt that three persons were killed, by herdsmen close to Katsina Ala, around Ankya, Mbamena, Ukum LGA, but they were working together with these Gana boys.” He however said that to a large extent, security personnel posted to the area have been able to contain the activities of bandits. Atera said, “We have reduced the Gana boys, so what they are doing is that anytime they want to attack, they plan with the herdsmen. They are the ones that invited them to come and cause mayhem in the land. So they are living together in the bush. “For now, we have calmed the situation. We have combed the entire place and we are not allowing them to cluster in one place again. Anywhere we see that they have formed a camp, we destroy the camp. So they are not settled to plan for a reprisal attack as they threatened.”
