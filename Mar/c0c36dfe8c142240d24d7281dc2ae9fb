The Nigerian Export Promotion Council (NEPC) has commenced the review of its Zero Oil Plan (ZOP) corporate strategy 2019-2023 as well as tools for effective monitoring performance to meet with the present-day economic realities. This was contained in a statement issued by NEPC Head of Corporate Communications, Ndubueze Okeke. Declaring open a five-day retreat for NEPC top management and board members with the theme: “Export for Survival” the Executive Director/Chief Executive Officer, Dr Ezra Yakusak, implored officers to fully participate towards building a virile organisation for the benefit of all and the growth of the nation’s economy. Yakusak while outlining the Corporate goals and expectations of the Council in its quest to reposition the non-oil sector for the sustainable economic development of the nation, said the objectives of the retreat were to create an atmosphere for productive engagement and interaction with a view to evaluating the operational activities of the Council as well as review its vision, mission and challenges in pursuit of promoting and diversification of Nigeria’s non-oil export trade. “Ultimately, a process of designing a road map shall be set up and this will give us a blueprint to focus on in subsequent years”, he said. The retreat which commenced with a workout session also provided a platform for effective Board and Management relationships in order to enhance organisational development with the view to building a motivated and productive workforce as well as effective communication and brand/communication strategy.
