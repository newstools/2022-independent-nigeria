Roman Abramovich has been disqualified as a director of Chelsea by the Premier League board. The decision comes after Abramovich was hit by UK government sanctions on Thursday, in turn imposing severe operational restrictions on Chelsea. “Following the imposition of sanctions by the UK government, the Premier League board has disqualified Roman Abramovich as a director of Chelsea Football Club,” a Premier League statement said.

The club can now spend up to £900,000 on match day costs – increased from £500,000 – and will have access to prize money earned. Restrictions on selling tickets and the club’s travel budget have not yet been amended.
