Pep Guardiola played down his role in Manchester City’s win at Southampton after two substitutes came off the bench to score. The Blues started brightly in their FA Cup quarter-final and were rewarded when Gabriel Jesus put the ball past Fraser Forster inside the opening 10 minutes. However, they ended the first half badly and went in level at the break, before being further tested in the second half by a tenacious Ralph Hasenhuttl side. Kevin De Bruyne stepped up to convert a penalty when Jesus was fouled to restore City’s advantage, but it was the substitutions who made the game safe: Phil Foden and Riyad Mahrez produced clinical finishes to allow the team to cruise through the final 20 minutes after previously making hard work of the tie. Oleksandr Zinchenko, Nathan Ake, and Fernandinho also came on in the final 10 minutes. Foden and Mahrez produced the sort of finishes that were ultimately absent from the City performance earlier in the week when they drew 0-0 at Crystal Palace in the Premier League – a game where Guardiola was also questioned for failing to make any substitutions. Despite enjoying the impact that his changes made, the City boss did not want to take any credit for them as he celebrated his team booking their place in the FA Cup semi-finals. “I don’t know how many times I took that decision and it was wrong,” he said. “The intention of the manager was to be better. I’d love to tell you I was so clever in the substitutions but that is not the case.”
