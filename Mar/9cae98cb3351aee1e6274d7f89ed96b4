The National Chairman of the People’s Democratic Party (PDP), Iyorchia Ayu has been warned by the Department of State Services (DSS) against altering any form of unguarded remarks to the department or other security agencies in the country. The security agency’s warning followed the recent remark made by the PDP Chairman that the party will not use the DSS to harass Nigerians when it eventually takes over power in 2023. Reacting in a statement issued by its spokesperson, Peter Afunanya, the security outfit described the comment of the PDP’s national chairman as an unprovoked verbal attack that portrays its image in a very bad light. 2023: Tinubu Will Turn Nigeria’s Economy Around  –… 2023: Tinubu, Aregbesola Set To Reconcile According to the department, contrary to Ayu’s recent remarks, it remains neutral and transparent in carrying out its duties. Asking Ayu to stop connecting it with party politics, the security body gave a stern warning to refrain from maligning its reputation any further. The statement partly read, “Except to malign and incite the people against it, the Service questions the rationale behind such an unprovoked description of it by Chief Ayu who had variously benefitted from it and indeed the State. “Having served variously as Senate President, Minister of Education, Industry, Internal Affairs and Environment, with full complements of security details, he knows the Service is never used to harass the people. And if he ever used the details for negative purposes (unknown to the Service), he should know that the times have changed. “Ayu knows that the Service is a frontline guardian of democracy and respects the rule of law in Nigeria. It is committed to the protection of the people. POLL “While members of the public are urged to disregard Ayu’s statement, politicians are enjoined to desist from making unguarded utterances with tendencies to breach public order.”
