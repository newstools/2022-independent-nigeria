The arraignment of Mr Omoyele Sowore, a 2023 Presidential aspirant, over allegations of cybercrime charges, was stalled at the Federal High Court Abuja, on Wednesday. Sowore was to be docked by the Federal Government on three-count criminal charges following a complaint by a businessman, Mr Ned Nwoko. Although Sowore was present in court, his media outfit, Sahara Reporters, an online medium, charged along with him was not in court and did not have any legal representation. The prosecution counsel, Emmanuel Inegbenoise informed the court that Sahara Reporters (2nd defendant) was not served with a copy of the criminal charges as required by law. Consequently, he pleaded the court for a short adjournment to enable him perfect service of the charges on the 2nd Defendant. However, Tope Temokin, counsel to Sowore did not object to the application for an adjournment.Temokin had initially announced an appearance for the 2nd defendant but dramatically made a u-turn, by withdrawing his appearance. In a short ruling, trial judge, Justice Emeka Nwite granted the adjournment request and fixed April 25 for the arraignment. The court ordered the Federal Government to ensure service of the charges on the 2nd defendant before the adjourned date.
