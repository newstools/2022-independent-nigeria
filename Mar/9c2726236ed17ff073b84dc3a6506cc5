Burnley have been scuppered in their efforts to bring Premier League winner Victor Moses to Turf Moor on a short-term deal, according to multiple reports in national titles. The Clarets, who are engaged in a relegation battle, tried to bring the Spartak Moscow winger in to end his predicament in Russia but the plan was not met with approval by the Premier League itself. It is understood that Moses, Burnley and Spartak Moscow were all open to the move happening until the end of the season. Burnley have reportedly been informed they cannot bring in Moses on a short-term deal over concerns moves between the Russian league and Premier League could harm the sporting integrity of the league, despite the ongoing conflict in Ukraine. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine resulted in both domestic leagues being suspended and FIFA and UEFA taking the decision to allow players from teams in these leagues to join other leagues even though the window is shut. The Premier League, however, joined the Bundesliga and Serie A is preventing any moves from taking place despite the willingness of all parties. Burnley are next in action against Manchester City on April 2 before consecutive relegation battle fixtures against Everton and Norwich City which could go a long way to deciding how the table looks at the end of the season.
