ONITSHA – Lack of mutual trust between the Federal Government and lecturers in Nigeria’s public universities, which has subsequently led to obstruction of university academic calendar, has continued to be a source of worry to parents whose wards are in the public universities. Recently, the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU), the umbrella organization of lecturers in the nation’s public universities, embarked on a one-month warning strike over the alleged inability of the Federal Government to honour its own part of the agreement reached with the union. The strike action, which has become perennial, according to some people, has further exposed the uncertainty in Nigeria’s university education sector as the Federal Government, which is the lecturers’ employer, seems not perturbed by the current situation. However, some Nigerians are of the opinion that the Federal Government should honour the “Gentleman’s agreement” earlier reached with ASUU in order to save the university education from gradual collapse. A surveyor and member, Surveyors Council of Nigeria (SCN), Donatus Chukwuemeka Enendu, in an interview at the weekend, advised the Federal Government to see honouring the agreement reached with ASUU as a national sacrifice. Enendu, emeritus President- General, Uke Development Union, Idemili North Local Government Area of Anambra State, said that honouring the agreement reached with ASUU would portray the government as a responsible one, as well as save the nation’s university education from international mockery. He disclosed that private universities were currently taking advantage of the incessant strikes to spring-up to the detriment of university education in Nigeria. He, however, advised government not to allow the present impasse to degenerate. An educationist and proprietor, Akunne Oniah Memorial Group of Schools, Onitsha, Jude Oniah, in a separate chat, said that ASUU members were products of the Nigerian society who daily witness rot in the entire system.
