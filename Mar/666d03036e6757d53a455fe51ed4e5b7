Juventus have reportedly entered the race to sign rumoured Tottenham and Newcastle United target Antonio Rudiger, who is set to leave Chelsea this summer. According to Gazzetta dello Sport, the Old Lady are plotting to offer the defender a contract in the coming weeks, with Rudiger a top target for Juventus as the German international looks to depart west London this summer. The centre-back, who earns a reported £100,000-a-week, has developed into one of the Premier League’s top centre-backs under Thomas Tuchel, with the former AS Roma star catching the eye of Juventus, as well as the likes of Newcastle and Tottenham. Juventus Willing To Include Rabiot In Deal To Sign Chelsea… Manchester City Keeping Tabs on the Juventus Forward Paulo… According to the Telegraph, PIF-backed Newcastle are interested in signing Rudiger as Eddie Howe looks to bring a world-class defender this summer, whilst Eurosport report that Tottenham are also keen on the 28-year-old. With Chelsea owner Roman Abramovic being sanctioned by the UK Government this week, there is now a strong chance Rudiger can walk from the Blues for free with his contract expiring this summer, and Juventus could be well-positioned to sign the German. Whilst Tottenham and Newcastle can offer the wages the defender is likely seeking, Rudiger could be tempted with a return to Italy with Juventus, with the centre-back knowing the league well from his time with Roma. Thursday’s landmark decision on Abramovic has stunned the footballing world, with the very future of Chelsea as a club under risk given the actions taken by the UK Government, and for Juventus, they could be viewing this as a golden chance to sign Rudiger. With Chelsea now legally unable to do anything to stop out-of-contract players from leaving, Juventus will be able to go big on signing Rudiger, with the Old Lady no doubt eager to beat both Newcastle and Tottenham to land the German titan.
