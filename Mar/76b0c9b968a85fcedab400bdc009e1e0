ONITSHA – Haruna Street Amalgamated Traders’ Association situated adjacent to Onitsha Main Market has banned the burning of refuse within the entire market. This is to avoid any unpleasant situation that may lead to an eventual fire outbreak in the area. Recently, there have been incidents of fire disaster in some markets around the Onitsha metropolis in which lives, goods and property have been lost to the inferno. NAHCON Commends Katsina Pilgrims Board For Improved Facilities PMQs: Johnson Struggles To Defend Refugee Policy Chairman, Haruna Street Amalgamated Traders’Association, Chief Emmanuel Idoko who spoke to our correspondent on phone yesterday over incessant fire outbreaks in markets said that his association was being proactive as the market leadership had taken a decision to ban refuse to burn by traders transacting their businesses in the area. Chief Idoko disclosed that there were plans to install fire extinguishers at strategic places in and around the market in case of any eventuality. While calling on Line Chairmen and Secretaries to fortify their area with fire extinguishers, the market boss, however, revealed that penalties await any defaulter who would be regarded as a saboteur to the market. Recently, there was a fire disaster along Onitsha/Owerri Road by Obodo-Ukwu Road, Onitsha which nearly engulfed Ogbaru Main Market save for the timely intervention of the market authorities who struggled to put off the fire by applying fire extinguishers strategically manned in the entire market. However, about 15 residential buildings in the popular “Okolo Estate”, housing a former shoe site was gutted by fire. POLL The fire was reported to have been caused by a petroleum tanker that fell near the area which spilt its contents on the road. Since the incident market leaders and corporate bodies have been taking proactive measures to nip in the board any form of fire outbreak in their vicinity.
