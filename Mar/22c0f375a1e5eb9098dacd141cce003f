Coutinho joined Aston Villa on loan from Barcelona in the winter transfer window and has made a considerable impact on Steven Gerrard’s team. Aston Villa have an option to buy him from Barcelona at the end of the season for an agreed fee of €40m. Villa are happy with his performance but they are yet to make a decision on whether to invest big sums on signing Coutinho permanently in the summer. Amidst the uncertainty surrounding his future, other clubs are showing an interest in him and according to Spanish daily Mundo Deportivo, Coutinho’s camp have been contacted by Arsenal. The Gunners have a long-standing interest in the former Liverpool star and are again considering signing him in the summer. Villa have the option to buy him but if they are not keen, Arsenal are prepared to sign him. Arsenal are fourth in the league table and could offer him Champions League football next season, which Villa cannot at the moment. But Coutinho is happy at Aston Villa and is relishing his spell at Villa Park.
