BENIN  – Edo North Chapter of the South-South Movement Group (SSMG) on Friday explained their interest in the pressure on Comrade Adams Oshiom­hole to contest the 2023 senato­rial election, saying that the call for the former Governor of the state to contest the Edo North senatorial seat was the demand of the generality of the people and not just the group. The convener, Mr. Vitalis Eshokene who addressed the media in Benin pointed out that while they were not disturbed with insinuation about their ethnicity, they remain resolute to join the masses in calling on the former governor to contest. Eshokene noted that the call is not borne out of any selfish in­terest but the need to change the narrativeinthesenatorialdistrict.

We all know his achievements in these offic­es, so there is no point in asking whether he did perform in these positions. “Our desire to get Oshiom­hole to contest is to replicate what he did as the governor of Edo and President of the NLC. “There is no gainsaying that Oshiomhole, while he was gov­ernor of Edo State, left indelible developmental footprints and for God to have given us Osh­iomhole we want him to come and perform what he did for the State in Edo North by attracting people’s oriented projects.”
