IBADAN – Ahead of the March 26 convention of the All Progressives Congress, Oyo State Chapter of the party has inaugurated 35 state executive members and 32 Local Government chairmen with the exception of Egbeda local government area at the party secretariat, Oke Ado, Ibadan, the state capital. The State Chairman of the party, Hon. Isaac Omodewu while speaking after the inauguration stated that the new local and ward executives were products of the ongoing harmonisation and reconciliation process within the party. While noting that all tendencies within Oyo State APC have stakes in the party structure from ward to state level, Hon. Omodewu clarified that the inauguration of party chairman of Egbeda LGA was stepped down due to pending issues. Omodewu vowed that with the ongoing harmonisation and reconciliation process, APC would dislodge Governor Seyi Makinde-led Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in 2023 general elections. He also promised to unite every member of the party and lead APC to victories in 2023 general elections.
