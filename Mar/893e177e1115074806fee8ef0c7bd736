LAGOS – The Lagos State Government has noted with dismay how commercial motorcyclists (Okada), dispatch riders and men of the Nigeria Armed Forces in official uniform and mufti have virtually turned the wheelchair ramps on pedestrian bridges to make-shift bridges for crossing to the opposite lanes on major expressways in the State. CP Gbemisola Akinpelu (retd), Corps Marshal of the Lagos Environmental Sanitation Corps, (LAGESC), disclosed this today at the Agency’s Command Headquarters, Bolade-Oshodi. According to her, ‘‘Unruly commercial motorcyclists, uniformed men on private bikes and dispatch riders are in the habit of plying the wheelchair ramps meant for People Living With Disabilities (PLWD) to cross to the other lanes on expressways in Lagos State’’. The Corps Marshal further stressed that this negative development has affected the use of bridges for pedestrians and People Living With Disabilities (PLWD) as they now resort to crossing the expressway thereby endangering their lives. She highlighted that this negative trend is one that needs to be stemmed and defaulters be prosecuted according to the law. She finally avowed that the administration of the executive Governor of Lagos State, Mr. Babajide Sanwo-Olu has instructed that any ‘okada’ rider, dispatch rider or member of the Nigeria Armed Forces apprehended for this wrong conduct will be dealt with in accordance to the Lagos State Environmental Management and Protection Law 2017 as amended whilst the seized motorcycles will be subsequently confiscated.
