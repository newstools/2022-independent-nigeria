Lagos – The massive 3-0 win recorded by Rangers International FC, over reigning NPFL champions, Akwa United FC at the ‘Nest of Champions’, Godswill Akpabio International stadium over the weekend, may have come to many as a surprise but not to the Ghanaian shot-stopper of the ‘Flying Antelopes’, Seidu Mutawakilu. In an exclusive chat, Mutawakilu said that before the match, he had promised his coach of keeping a clean sheet, which he believes will propel his teammates to convert chances. “Before the match, I did promise coach Abdul Maikaba that I will get a clean sheet and it came to pass while the goals harvested also did not come to me as a surprise because we have a crop of players that can deliver the goods at anytime and anywhere,” said the former Ghanaian youth international. Seidu, who was almost snatched from Rangers by the ‘Promise Keepers’ at the start of the season further said that the presence of Rangers supporter’s club at the stands did a lot to motivate the team stressing, “The presence of the supporter’s club at the stadium drumming from start to finish went a long way to act as a motivating factor for the win. “Coming all the way from Enugu to Uyo and never stopped singing till the goals started coming was very great and I appreciate them for that.” The goalkeeper, who has five clean sheets in nine matches this season is optimistic about his team catching up with the pacesetters on the log.
