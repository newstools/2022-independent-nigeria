COVID-19 cases increased only 4% worldwide in the past week but some nations in Europe, including Italy with a 43% rise and France at 36%, have experienced surges as a new sub-variant travels around the world and countries relax restrictions. In all, a total of 470,426,758 cases have been reported worldwide, including 11,773,847 in the past week, in tracking by Worldometers.info so far Sunday. And deaths rose 35,583 in a 19% weekly decline for a total of 6,099,443. Of those cases, 47.9% have occurred in three nations — South Korea, Germany and Vietnam — all adding at least 1 million. Those countries account for only 3.9% of the population. South Korea led the world last week with an increase of 2,832,661 cases, representing a 42% gain, including a daily record 621,328 Thursday after only 630,748 through the end of last year. Sunday’s increase was 334,708. And deaths rose 327 with the record 429 Thursday and fatalities under 100 late December. Starting Monday, the government will increase the limit on private gatherings to eight people from the six. And starting April 1, fully vaccinated overseas travelers and travlers with a registered vaccination history with South Korea’s Q-Code website will be able to enter the country without a seven-day quarantine period. Coronavirus continues to surge elsewhere in Asia with the continent reporting an 8% weekly rise with Europe second at 5%. North America dropped 21%, South America 17%, Africa 34% but Oceania went up 15%. Mainland China, where the outbreak was first announced in December 2019, reported 1,737 cases Sunday after 3,602 March 15, the most since mid-February 2020. And the nation on Saturday reported the first two deaths since a year ago January for a total of 4,638 in 88th, behind Sudan with 4,888. With a “zero tolerance” for cases, 37 million of the 1.5 billion population are under lockdown. State media says 95% of the cases are mild. POLL And Hong Kong reported 1,597 cases Saturday for a total of 1,033,541 with the record 56,827 March 10, and 249 fatalities for a cumulative 5,650, including a record 294 March 11.

In Britain, cases roses 6% in a week but its total of 460,661 was sixth, including ahead of No. 4 France with 602,155 and Italy at 460,661. “Over the last year or so, what happens in the U.K. usually happens here a few weeks later,” Dr. Anthony Fauci, President Joe Biden’s chief medical advisor said in an interview with NPR. “And right now, the U.K. is seeing somewhat of a rebound in cases.” “All three of those factors we have here in the United States,” Fauci said. “So I would not be surprised if in the next few weeks we see either a plateauing … of cases or even [the curve] rebounds and slightly goes up. That is entirely conceivable. And we’re just going to have to follow it carefully.” The United States’ cases dropped 24% and it leads the world with 81,404,135 cases and 997,845 deaths. Britain celebrated its Freedom Day on Feb. 24 with the end to restrictions. People aren’t legally required to self-isolate after testing positive for the virus. “My main concern is for the vulnerable for whom this disease is serious,” James Naismith, director of the Rosalind Franklin Institute and professor of structural biology at the University of Oxford, told the BBC, “Every effort must be made to triple vaccinate as many people as possible, quadruple vaccinate the most vulnerable.” Britain’s one-shot vaccination rate among the entire population is 78.6%. Most nations in Europe are heavily vaccinated, according to tracking by Bloomberg. In the European Union, it’s 75.8%, including 87.3% in Spain, 84% in France, 85% in Italy, 83.2% in Denmark, 77.3% in Netherlands, 76.5% in Germany, 76.5% in Austria. Russia is lagging the world in vaccination with 54% of its population with at least one dose of a domestic-produced vaccine, including Sputnik 5. Two other Eastern European nations have low vaccination rates: Ukraine at 38% and Romania at 42.2%. Poland’s rate is 59.6% and Czech Republic’s is 65%. In all, more than 11.1 billion COVID-19 vaccine doses have been administered worldwide, an increase of 200 million in one week with the world’s population of 7.9 billion. Broken down by world regions, the United States and Canada have administered at least one dose to 78% of the population, followed by Latin America at 77%, Asia-Pacific 77%, Europe at 68%, Middle East 55% and Africa at 19%, according to The New York Times tracking. Germany reported 119 deaths Saturday and is in 14th overall at 127,408. Germany is in phase two of a reduction in restrictions with a Freedom Day scheduled Sunday to end all rules. But all 16 federal states have gone to a transition period, with rules that include required indoor mask wearing to end at the beginning of April. The period does not allow for caps on the number of people entering events. In Bundestag, testing and vaccine entry requirements will be restricted to facilities for vulnerable groups, including nursing homes and hospitals. “We are seeing record infections and the situation may worsen again in the autumn,” Reiner Hoffmann, chairman of the German Federation of Trade Unions, told the Funke Mediengruppe newspaper. “I plead for the disease control law to be quickly tightened up. We must not risk the workplace becoming a hotbed of infection again.” On Sunday, Russia reported 434 deaths one day after 495, the first time under 500 since mid June, with the record 1,254 on Nov. 19, for a total of 364,492 in fourth place and an 18% drop in the past week.

On Monday, people in France were allowed to not wear masks indoors and they won’t have to show a vaccine pass to enter public places. “We are free for the first time in two years,” NPR’s Eleanor Beardsley said on Morning Edition. “The only place they’ll have to wear their mask is public transport, hospitals and retirement homes. France has had some of Europe’s toughest restrictions. You had to show complete vaccination to enter restaurants, cafes, cinemas or planes and trains. Since last November, a negative test was not sufficient.” Italy reported 60,415 infections Sunday with the record 228,179 in mid-January and is ninth overall at 13,861,743. And the nation is eighth in deaths with 157,785, including 93 Sunday.
