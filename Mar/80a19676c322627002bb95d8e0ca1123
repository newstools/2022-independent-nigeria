GOMBE – The Bukola Saraki Contact and Advocacy Council, has faulted the call for a power shift arrangement where Nigeria’s President is expected to emerge from either South or North. He said, what Nigeria needs now is not a President from Southern or Northern part of the country, but a highly educated and young Nigerian who will identify with every single part of the country. Chairman of the council, Professor Iyorwese Hagher, stated this when he and his team visited Gombe State on a consultation and awareness meeting with PDP stakeholders. He said they intend to tour all States of the country before their principal, former Senate President, Bukola Saraki, comes up to declare his intension to contest for President of Nigeria. According to him, the former two term Governor of Kwara State, Dr. Bukola Saraki, is the only Nigerian among all the Presidential contestants that best qualifies to rule Nigeria and take it out of the mess the APC Government has created. He said, “that Nigerian who is young, experienced, has a large heart, has empathy, has a vision and mission to make Nigeria a great country, is Dr. Bukola Saraki”. “We’re rallying round him, hoping that the PDP will make the right choice since he is experienced in economy and a consummate politician. “This is the reason for our consultation with stakeholders, delegates to come up with consensus in choosing a great Nigerian President”, he stressed. POLL He said, Nigerians have already experienced so much pain in the hands of the APC Government who made fake promises to Nigerians and that the people have the duty to vote them out in 2023.
