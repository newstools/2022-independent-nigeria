Liverpool have made it known to Marcus Rashford’s representatives that they are admirers of the Manchester United forward, as the striker considers his future at Old Trafford. The 24-year-old is open to leaving the Theatre of Dreams after falling out of favour under Ralf Rangnick. Rashford looked a shadow of his former self during a substitute appearance in the 1-0 defeat to Atletico Madrid on Tuesday and he was forced into a public apology for getting embroiled in a spat with a supporter outside the ground afterwards. Paris Saint-Germain have twice enquired about Rashford in the past, only to be knocked back in their attempts by United. The Ligue 1 giants are again interested in Rashford, particularly as they’re likely to lose Kylian Mbappe to Real Madrid on a free transfer. Barcelona are also keen, with Xavi keen to add more firepower to his frontline as Ousmane Dembele is set to leave the club. But the Manchester Evening News controversially claim that Liverpool have made it clear how interested they are in Rashford. No player has switched between the clubs since 1964 and Rashford would be the most high profile if he were to ever swap Old Trafford for Anfield. POLL While United would not countenance selling Rashford to Liverpool, he is out of contract in 2023 and could theoretically move to another club on a free transfer – should United not take up their option of extending his deal by 12 months. Mohamed Salah and Sadio Mane are both out of contract in 2023, and Jurgen Klopp showed his ruthlessness by signing Luis Diaz in January. The Colombian has already proven a huge hit at Anfield and Liverpool are unwilling to break their wage structure to give Salah the £400,000-a-week wages he craves. Rashford’s preference is to remain at United but he’s worried about a lack of playing time and he fears for his place in England’s 2022 World Cup squad.
