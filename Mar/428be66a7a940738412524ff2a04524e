IBADAN – The Oyo State Command, Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC), has reassured Nigerians of the best service from their trained personnel in order to curtail road crashes which usually in most cases lead to loss of lives and properties. Speaking during the First Quarter Retreat for officers in the command, Commander Uche Chukwurah maintained that the retreat is meant to enhance professionalism and as well, reduce crashes on the roads. She also stressed that mechanisms have been put in place to ensure that any officer caught collecting bribe are punished accordingly. The theme of the retreat was: “Professionalism in FRSC Operations, Imperatives for Data Collection, Administration and Promp Report Rendition: Tools for Policy Formulation.” The retreat was organised for Heads of Departments, Unit Commanders, Staff Officer’s operations, among others. Chukwurah said: “FRSC does not encourage bribe collection no matter how small it is. “We are not encouraging them to extort the public; they are actually being dealt with through mechanism in FRSC. “Motorists give bribes because they want to avoid being punished for an offence they have committed in order to cut corners by giving bribe to avoid arrest. POLL “Stop giving bribes, the givers and the takers are guilt.” She said that the command would not take it likely with officers caught collecting bribes. The sector commander said that the retreat was to look inward so as to close the noticed gaps in order to achieve the desired goals for the corps. Chukwurah said the retreat was to also reduce road crashes, adding that they would be able to come up with ways of curtailing incessant crashes at the end of the retreat. She said the corps would discuss extensively how best to reduce crashes, adding that no stone would be left unturned to achieve the best for the corps and the public.
