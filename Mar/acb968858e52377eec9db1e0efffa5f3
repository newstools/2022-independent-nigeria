Chelsea are without trio Reece James, Andreas Christensen and Callum Hudson-Odoi for the FA Cup quarter-final at Middlesbrough. James was named in the England squad this week despite only playing 147 minutes of football this year and missed the midweek Champions League win against Lille due to injury. Christensen limped off in the first half of the victory in France, while Hudson-Odoi has been struggling with an Achilles issue. All three players took part in light training on Thursday but Thomas Tuchel said on the Friday that they faced late fitness tests and none of them have made the trip. Asked if he was surprised by James’ England call-up, Tuchel said on Friday: “Yes and no. I would always call Reece up no matter what if I was the head coach of the England national team so I’m not surprised. “Yesterday he was not match ready so let’s see what happens tomorrow. He comes now from nine weeks of injuries altogether and we have to do late tests to see if he can even do full training today and be match ready for tomorrow, which is a big doubt. If not, it makes no sense for him to go.” It’s a strong looking Chelsea side at the Riverside, with an experienced backline as Cesar Azpilicueta, Thiago Silva and Antonio Rudiger all start. Romelu Lukaku leads the line, with Hakim Ziyech and Christian Pulisic in the wide areas. There are options to turn to on the bench too, with N’Golo Kante, Kai Havertz and Timo Werner among those waiting in the wings. POLL Chelsea XI: Mendy, Azpilicueta, Silva, Rudiger, Sarr, Kovacic, Loftus-Cheek, Mount, Ziyech, Lukaku, Pulisic Subs: Bettinelli, Alonso, Kenedy, Chalobah, Kante, Barkley, Havertz, Vale, Werner
