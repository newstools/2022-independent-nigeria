Dr. Orji noted that compared to the N2.6 trillion owed in 2019, the revenue recorded a dip by 40 percent within the year under review, adding that the num­ber of defaulting companies dropped from 77 reported by NEITI in 2019 to 51 in 2020. The NEITI boss described the current debts as collectable revenues that are due to the fed­eration by the Department of Petroleum Resources and the FederalInlandRevenueService, stressing that the latest reports outlined the specific revenue streams that accounted for the liabilities in question. “These include royalty oil, royalty gas, concession rentals, petroleum profit tax, company income tax, education tax, val­ue added tax, withholding tax, among others. “The courageous public dis­closure of companies’ liabilities to the federation by NEITI was inlinewithitsnationalmandate and in fulfilment of its obliga­tion as a member of the global Extractive Industries Transpar­ency Initiative (EITI), and not in any way against the companies. POLL “NEITI’s disclosure seeks to draw the attention of the oil and gas companies to their obliga­tions to remit all revenues due to government, especially at this time that government is in dire need of revenues to rebuild the nation’s infrastructure and im­prove the investment climate in the country”, Dr. Orji explained. He described the companies as the backbone of the industry. “Without the companies there will be no industry, no in­vestments and no revenues to remit”, Orji said. To this end, he said NEITI will continue to support the companies and also expect that they live up to their obligations, as regard to payment of taxes, royalties and levies to the federa­tion, as they do in other jurisdic­tions of their operations. The NEITI 2020 oil and gas report also revealed that Nigeria earned $20.43 billion from the oil and gas sector in 2020. The fig­ure represents a decline of 40% compared to the $34.22 billion realised from the sector in 2019.

The report also revealed that the total crude oil production in 2020 was 646.7mmbbls, repre­senting a 12% decrease when compared to the 735.24mmbbls produced in 2019. Out of the above total production in 2020, 648.48mmbbls were lifted, and this was 11.85% lower than the 735.66mmbbls lifted in 2019. On domestic crude alloca­tion and consumption, the NE­ITI report also disclosed that 107.746mmbls was managed by the NNPC under the direct sale direct purchase (DSDP) ar­rangement. It also revealed that thevalueof thecrudeexchanged under the DSDP arrangement was $6.7 billion, while the value of the refined products received for local consumption was $6.03 billion, indicating a variance of $134.78 million. As regard to fuel subsidy, the NEITI report further disclosed that N106.9 billion was paid as subsidy between January and June 2020 to sustain product availability with an outstanding balance of N26.74 billion yet to be paid. NEITI also reported that 20.01 billion litres of petrol, 52 million litres of kerosene and 5.33 billion litres of diesel were, respectively, imported into the country for domestic use during the period under review. On oil theft and crude loss­es, the report made assessment based on the data provided to NEITI by 22 of the 69 covered companies. According to the result of the assessment, 39.16mmbls of crude valued at $44.73 million (N15.71 billion) was stolen with 349 cases of pipeline vandalism recorded in 2020. This is an im­provement when compared to the 1,387 cases of vandalism reported in 2019. On gas production, the report revealed that the gas sub-sector contributed over $1.5 billion to the Federation Account. According to the report, the total gas production in 2020 was 3.01 million cubic feet. While 64% of this total quantity was sold, 8% was flared and 4% un­accounted for. The NEITI report also showed that the oil and gas sec­tor contributed only 8.16% to the total GDP in 2020. This rep­resents a decline of 0.46% when compared to the 8.62% recorded in 2019. The report further re­vealed that the sector dominat­ed the country’s export in 2020, contributing about 75% (N9.44 trillion) of the total export value of N12.52 trillion. Furthermore, the report made far reaching recommen­dations including the urgent need for further investigations into the circumstances sur­rounding the transfer of the federation’s stake in OML 24 op­erated by Pan Ocean and New Cross Energy. NEITI’s concern is on the value for money of the transaction, payment for the federation equity interest and recovery of the $309.1 million that should have been paid for the asset. The report also welcomed the Petroleum Industry Act and the prompt decision of President Buhari to set up a nine-member committee, in­cluding NEITI, to oversee its im­plementation, adding that the courageous implementation of the reports of the steering com­mittee when concluded will set the stage for a new oil and gas industry ready for competition and investment going forward. This is the 13th cycle of in­dependent oil and gas industry report by the Nigeria Extractive Industries Transparency Ini­tiative (NEITI) in line with the NEITI Act 2007 and in fulfil­ment of Nigeria’s obligation to the global Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI).
