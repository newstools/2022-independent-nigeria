Rivers State Governor, Nyesom Wike, is relishing that his administration has not failed the Christian community as he had built a worship centre for Christians. Wike disclosed this on Sunday while speaking at the 60th birthday celebration of the founder of the Royal House of Grace Church, Apostle Zilly Aggrey in Port Harcourt. The governor said, “We are glad that the Christians stood up. We are glad that the Christians in this place did not go to sleep, that is why I thought it necessary to recall this incident because the hour has come again. And we are also proud to say as an administration that we have not failed the Christian community. “As a government, we built a worship place for the Christian community for the first time in the history of Rivers State, the wonderful edifice called the Christian Ecumenical Centre, where Christians gather and call the name of God. “We have also with the fear of God Almighty not taken your support and prayer for granted as we have delivered on critical infrastructure. Today, anybody who has lived in this city (Port Harcourt) in the last five years will agree with me that even our opponents agree that we have done well in terms of infrastructure. “We have improved the security situation in this state. And I tell you that the crime index for this state has dropped drastically and last year, the Nigerian Police Force recognised Rivers state as one of the safest states. And so what is the implication of that? It means that the economic activities of the state had improved and then the economic indexes of the state had also improved.”
