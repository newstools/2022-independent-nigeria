Serhiy Kvit, head of the National Agency for Higher Education Quality Assurance of Ukraine and former minister of education and science in Ukraine, has called on academics worldwide to take a stand against Russian President Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine. Following the beginning of a full-scale military attack on Ukraine by Russian military forces, involving the bombing of cities outside the separatist areas in Donetsk and Luhansk, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has declared martial law in the country and all higher education provision has been put on hold. University World News reports that students and staff at Ukrainian universities have been told to stay at home until further notice, after Russia launched a military invasion in the country on 24 February.

Kvit, who is also a professor at the National University of Kyiv-Mohyla Academy, said the war will involve the death of Ukrainian civilians, including children as well as those fighting the invasion. He said, “The academic community can’t keep silent on this unheard-of war. You, academics, know Europe’s history of the 20th century the best, the history of the Second World War and its consequences for Europe and the world.”
