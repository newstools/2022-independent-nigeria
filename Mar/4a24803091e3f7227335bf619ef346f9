AKURE – A chieftain of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Barrister Ifedayo Adedipe(SAN) has declared that the party would win all elective seats in Ondo State in the next general elections. This was contained in a statement by his media advisor, Femi Salako, made available to newsmen in Akure, the state capital on Friday. The legal luminary, who is aspiring for Ondo Central Senatorial District’s seat in 2023, explained that the party lost the last by-election in Akure South/North federal constituency due to misunderstanding engendered by the outcome of the party’s primary. He expressed confidence that the party would win all elective positions in the state in 2023, saying if the party’s leadership could settle all the grievances among the members, the party would come out victorious at the poll. Adedipe called on the leadership of PDP to set up a reconciliatory committee and invite all aggrieved members of the party to a roundtable to settle the misunderstanding before the party’s primary for the 2023 general elections. Speaking on his ambition, the learned silk canvassed that the legislative duty of Ondo Central should be yielded to a far more experienced and competent person so the people could have quality representation. The PDP chieftain emphasised that Ondo Central Senatorial District was truly in need of a fresh breath of quality representation at the Senate. He equally noted that Ondo State in particular and Nigeria at large needed to push forward their best brains for electoral positions. POLL The legal luminary stated that if the best brains were elected into public offices, it would be easier to turn around the nation’s socio-economic and political challenges.
