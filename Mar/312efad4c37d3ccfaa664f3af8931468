This is no doubt a defining moment for fine boy celebrity journalist and author, Azuh Arinze, as he joins the elite golden club. Azuh, a knight of the Catholic Church and a Rotarian of no mean repute, has been in the volatile business of pen-pushing for over two decades and he has held many top hierarchical positions in the journalistic profession. Before floating his YES! International Magazine a few years ago, Arinze was for many years the editor of Encomium Magazine and he is also the author of five best-selling motivational books about the rich and famous people in the society. To celebrate his 50th birthday, Azuh, the publisher/editor-in-chief has planned to make the day remarkable and memorable for him and his well-wishers, as he will be holding a two-in-one event that will have distinguished personalities like Chief Olusegun Osoba, Babatunde Fashola, Femi Adesina, Aare Dele Momodu, Dr. Dakuku Peterside, Lady Onyeka Onwenu and many others to gather for his birthday and books presentation. The event with the theme: Two New Books, A Taste of Success and Conversations With Showbiz Stars comes up at the Nigerian Institute of International Affairs (NIIA), on Kofo Abayomi Street, Victoria Island, Lagos. On his life at 50, Azuh quipped: “All I want to say is thank you, Lord. For life, for good health, my blessed family, my precious mother, my irreplaceable siblings, my supportive friends, my selfless mentors and all those who have supported me and my business in one way or the other. I am indeed very, very grateful for how far the Lord has brought and blessed me.”
