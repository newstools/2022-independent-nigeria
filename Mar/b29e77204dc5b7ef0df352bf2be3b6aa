IBADAN – The Oyo State Government, on Tuesday, has ordered the immediate closure of Oke-Ogun College of Management Sciences and Technology, Iseyin. The Honourable Commissioner for Education, Science and Technology, Barrister Rahman Abiodun Abdu-Raheem, said the institution was shut down for non-compliance with registration procedures. Recall that some indigenes of the town, under the auspices of ‘Ebedi Frontliner’, had petitioned the Oyo state government; the Minister of Education, Mallam Adamu Adamu; and the National Board for Technical Education, asserting that the institution was neither registered nor accredited for students’ enrolment among other allegations.
