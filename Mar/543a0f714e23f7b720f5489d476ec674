Roma have no intention of making the Ainsley Maitland-Niles loan spell from Arsenal permanent, so he is heading back to the Premier League with Everton interested. The 24-year-old joined on loan in January at a cost of €500,000 for six months, but made very little impact. He had initially been included in the line-up by Jose Mourinho, playing in six Serie A games and the Coppa Italia. However, he was dropped to the bench, where he has remained for the last four Serie A matches on the bounce. Maitland-Niles was only used recently in the Europa Conference League, when Mourinho rotated the squad. Italian media after confident he will not be purchased outright or even see his loan spell extended. A return to Arsenal is not likely to last long either, with Mirror Sport suggesting Everton are interested in making a summer swoop. They had already tried last year and saw the €12m proposal rejected.
