Nigerian singer, Chukwudi Ken Agali, popularly known as Chuddy K, has gone down memory lane, recounting some of the unfortunate events he encountered in the early days of his career. In an interview with HipTV. The ‘Slow Slow’ crooner recalled that a popular record label owner once paid OAPs not to air his songs on radio because he sounded like the label owner’s artiste. According to Chuddy K, it was the grace of God that save him from depression, stating that a lot of people are snakes in the Nigerian music industry. “Basically, they said I sounded like somebody in the industry. Maybe if I had come out before the person, they would have said the person sounded like me. But at the time when my first single ‘Slow Slow’ came out, it was a threat to someone’s record label and the person was paying many radio stations to stop my songs. A lot of OAPs told me. I don’t want to mention names because e go cause wahala. “But the grace of God has always been with me. They are the kind of things that make artistes frustrated and the next thing they are going through depression and they take their own life,” he said. He further noted that the events were futile as the said person is no longer big in the Nigerian music industry and has even parted ways with the said artiste, stating that tables turn and it is his time again.
