The President of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelensky, has warned the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, NATO, of an imminent Russian attack. Zelensky warned that Russian missiles might soon hit NATO countries if the body fails to close the Ukrainian sky. He spoke after an airstrike hit a Ukrainian military base close to the Polish border. In a video address on Monday, Zelensky reiterated his call for a no-fly zone sanction over Ukraine. “If you do not close our sky, it is only a matter of time before Russian missiles fall on your territory, on NATO territory, on the homes of NATO citizens. “Last year, I clearly warned NATO leaders that if there were no harsh preventive sanctions against the Russian Federation, it would go to war. We were right.”
