The owners of a British farm said they were shocked when a lamb was born recently with a fifth leg sticking out of its side. Heather Hogarty, the part-owner of Whitehouse Farm in the Morpeth, Northumberland, area, said the five-legged lamb was born as part of a set of triplets on February 22, and the animal appears to be in good health. “It is unusual, but we get many animals born with disabilities in our farm, it’s quite unfortunate you don’t get to see many of them because they get put down in some farms,” Hogarty said.

Quinto, a sheep born about a decade before the new arrival, had an extra leg in the center of her body. The limb had to be removed, but Quinto went on to have a long and healthy life, Hogarty said.
