GOMBE  – Dr. Jamilu Isyaku Gwamna, a PDP governorship aspirant in Gombe State, has promised to prioritise human capital development and youth em­ployment if elected governor of the state in 2023. Gwamna made the prom­ise in Dukku during an engagement meeting with stakeholders of the commu­nity. According to him, the need for human capital de­velopment through massive investment remains the key to economic prosperity for any state or country. He said: ”As an economist, I can tell you that no nation attains sustainable econom­ic growth without developing the human resources neces­sary to drive such growth. How we develop and utilise human capital is vital to economic productivity and growth.” Gwamna also said, “the most critical asset of any state is her people; this will be my priority because poor investment in human capital will deepen poverty and re­sult in low productivity; this is what we, by Allah’s Grace, hope to change.”
