LAGOS – His Grace, Most Rev. Alfred Adewale Martins, Catholic Archbishop of the Metropolitan See of Lagos, has called on deceitful politicians and preachers to amend their ways. He also called on corrupt public office holders, kidnappers, ritualists and all evil doers to repent before they ran out of time with their maker. Martins made the appeal on Wednesday during the day one broadcast of the Lenten reflections entitled: “A Return Journey”, to mark Ash Wednesday, the beginning of Lent; 40 days fast and prayers. 2022 IWD: NGO To Gift 100 Traders, Street Sweepers Food Items 2023: Hope Alive As Gov Emmanuel Reviews Ongoing Projects In… He described Ash Wednesday as the “beginning of the journey towards repentance”, adding, “It is our 40 days journey in which we are renewed through the Lenten observance and practices in preparation for the joy of Easter.” Ash Wednesday, he said, was a subtle reminder that life was “fragile, temporal and transient as it would end one day”, saying also that the Ash placed on the forehead reminds that man is dust and signifies the preparation for the ultimate journey back to his maker after sojourning on earth. The Archbishop said it was necessary for all to repent, stating:” If we do not repent from our sins, how can we receive a warm welcome back to Him(- God)? “… Let politicians who lie to the people repent. Let the ‘men of God’ who take advantage of their congregation return to the Lord. Let the ones who steal public funds return to the Lord. “Let the ones who kidnap for ransom repent. Let the money ritualists repent and return to God. Let those involved in activities inimical to their relationship with God to repent.”
