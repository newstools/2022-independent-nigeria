LAGOS -Nigeria’s billionaire businessman, Tony Elumelu has stated that the country couldn’t meet its oil production quota as approved by the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) due to huge volume of crude oil theft. His view was at variance with the Minister of State for Petroleum Resources, Chief Timipre Sylva position, who blamed Nigeria’s inability to meet its oil production quota on low investments. He lamented the spate of insecurity in Nigeria and how this had led to oil theft, which had prevented Nigeria from meeting its oil production quota. He said: “This morning, I am listening to my colleagues at the office bemoan the very pressing issues that they face every day in this country, and how things have been getting worse and worse – no electricity for five days, hikes in the price of diesel, frightening food inflation, etc. “How can a country so rich in natural resources have 90 per cent of its citizens living in hardship and poverty? I have often said that access to electricity is critical for our development, alleviation of poverty and hardship. And speaking of security, our people are afraid! “Businesses are suffering. How can we be losing over 95 per cent of oil production to thieves? Look at the Bonny Terminal that should be receiving over 200,000 barrels of crude oil daily, instead, it receives less than 3,000 barrels, leading the operator @Shell to declare force majeure.” He added: “Why are we paying taxes if our security agencies can’t stop this? It is clear that the reason Nigeria is unable to meet its OPEC production quota is not because of low investment but because of theft, pure and simple!” He said Nigeria is suffering, while other oil-producing nations were currently smiling, in view of the rise in global crude oil prices.
