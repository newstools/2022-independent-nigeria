FC Barcelona are tipped to beat bitter rivals Real Madrid to the signing of a Spanish pearl in Pablo Torre, according to reports. Rampant inflation in the transfer market has caused big clubs to look towards young promises as opposed to established stars, with Barca’s debts around the $1.5bn mark also a factor in this. While also scouring Brazil and in particular Santos for the stars of tomorrow, the Blaugrana are casting their nest domestically which has led them to Torre. Torre is under contract at current club Racing Santander, who he is fighting to help gain promotion from the Primera Division RFEF, until 2025 but has reportedly already agreed to leave this summer to take a step forward in his career. Real Madrid have been working on landing the 18-year-old for quite some time too, AS say, but Sport allege that Barca have entered the race to capture him with “great force” and are winning it for now. Aiding the Catalans in their plight is the excellent relationship the club has with Torre’s agent Arturo Canales, who also represents first team coach Xavi Hernandez and one of its captains in Gerard Pique. Torre is already an established international with Spain’s youth teams such as the u-19s where he has scored three goals in six caps, and had offers to leave Racing Santander before deciding to stay another season and help them with promotion.
