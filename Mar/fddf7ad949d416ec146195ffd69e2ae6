Lagos – Super Eagles assistant coach, Emmanuel Amuneke has revealed that the coaching crew is not thinking of stripping Sparta Rotterdam ace goalkeeper, Maduka Okoye of his status as the national team’s number one goalkeeper. Amuneke hinted that Okoye would be in the starting 11 that would play the Ghanaians, as they have no plans to replace him because of an error. The Super Eagles visit the Black Stars of Ghana in the first leg of the 2022 World Cup Playoffs on Friday, March 25 before the return and final leg on Tuesday, March 29 at the M.K.O Abiola National Stadium, Abuja. “I’m not a goalkeeper trainer, but we have someone in that department, which is Alloy Agu,” the former FC Barcelona winger said in a sport radio programme monitored in Lagos on Tuesday. “Regardless, Maduka Okoye is a good goalkeeper and human being, so we cannot because of one mistake dump (him). “He’s playing for his team (Sparta), and that’s the most important thing,” said Amunke as preparation continues for the crucial World Cup Playoffs. Okoye made his international debut against Brazil in October 2019 and has since risen from third-choice goalkeeper to the first-choice. The former Fortuna Dusseldorf goalie was in between the sticks during the FIFA World Cup and Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) qualifying campaigns. The 22-year-old also kept the goal in three of Nigeria’s four games at Cameroon 2022, with Francis Uzoho manning the posts against Guinea-Bissau. Okoye conceded only two goals, the last of which eliminated the Super Eagles from the tournament. POLL That strike, off the boots of Tunisia’s Youssef Msakni, is particularly painful, as it appeared Okoye could have kept outthe25-yardeffort, withmany fans blaming him for the ouster, especially on social media. But Okoye has gotten over that dark times and has delivered quality performances for Sparta Rotterdam as he leads the Eredivisie side’s charge towards escaping relegation.
