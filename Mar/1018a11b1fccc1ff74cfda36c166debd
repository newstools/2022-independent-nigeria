AWKA – The Anambra State Governor Professor Chukwuma Soludo has said that the release of the leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra, IPOB, Mazi Nnamdi Kanu will not be achieved through violence. Instead, according to Governor Soludo who spoke during the town hall meeting he had with the market leaders and leaders of different transport unions in Awka, Kanu’s release should be negotiated and approached with diplomacy. Governor Soludo maintained that he endorsed the recent statement made on March 7, 2022, by the Joint Body of South East Council of Traditional Rulers and Bishops, Archbishops on Peace and Conflict Resolution, requesting for a tripartite discussion between them, the Presidency, and Southeast governors to deal with the conflicts in the South East, especially in relation to Nnamdi Kanu, the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) and the Eastern Security Network (ESN.) The Governor called on armed Igbo youths to lay down their arms as his administration does not encourage shedding of blood of any sort. Maintaining that Anambra has all it takes to be great, Governor Soludo noted that everyone is important to the development of Anambra State. Soludo had at the weekend ordered workers to report to work on Monday in defference to the illegal sit-at-home observed on Mondays.
