Operators have cried out over fishing trawlers and barges currently constituting danger for moving crafts along the Kirikiri Lighter Terminal (KLT) waterfronts in Lagos. They have therefore called on the Nigerian Ports Authority (NPA), the Nigerian Maritime Administration and Safety Agency(NIMASA) to urgently stake steps towards removal to avoid accidents. Investigation revealed that most of the vessels, have been abandoned for over a decade, while some are currently in a particular spot for ages due to court injunctions. Others, it was gathered are statically positioned for repairs, maintenance and detention by regulatory authorities. Some of the trawlers numbering about twelve owned by fishing trawler operators were not seaworthy while others are in corrosive condition and beyond repairs. It was alleged that most of the trawlers are beyond repairs but some of the owners deliberately abandoned them in front of their jetties for possible sales as scrap metals. According to them, some of the vessels are there and nobody is querying the abandonment which poses danger to aquatic lives and navigation of smaller boats. It was also gathered that barging activities have also faced some level of hiccups while berthing to offload cargoes. POLL A barge operator who does not want his name in print lamented that movement of barges along the Kirikiri waterfront had become a major challenge, due to the abandoned vessels. The barger decried government negligence towards the evacuation of some of the critical wrecks along the waterways, adding that the Kirikiri Lighter Terminals play host to large volume of cargoes from the mother ports, namely the Lagos Ports Complex (LPC ), Apapa and Tin Can Island Port Complex (TCIPC).
