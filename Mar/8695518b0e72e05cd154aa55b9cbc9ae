Ahead of the 2023 general election, the Governor of Sokoto State, Aminu Tambuwal has said that the South-South geopolitical zone cannot win the presidential seat for the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) in the forthcoming election. Tambuwal stated this while calling on the leadership and stakeholders of the party to choose between zoning of its presidential ticket and winning the election. Speaking during a consultative meeting with former principal officers of the National Assembly in Abuja, Tambuwal said, “you cannot zone what you don’t have”. He, therefore, advised the leadership of the party and other stakeholders to first win the election before zoning it. The governor also gave an analogy of recent elections to show why it might be difficult for the South to win the presidency for the PDP based on votes cast. He urged the party to be strategic, saying that the All Progressives Congress (APC) took their presidential candidate to Katsina state in 2015 even when the late President Umaru Musa Yar’adua who was in office was also from Katsina. Tambuwal tasked the party to concentrate on how to win the election, rather than zoning of offices.
