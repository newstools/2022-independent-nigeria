Manchester United have been urged to sell ‘troublemakers’ Cristiano Ronaldo and Harry Maguire if Erik ten Hag is appointed as their next manager. Ten Hag is thought to be one of the frontrunners to take charge at Old Trafford when interim boss Ralf Rangnick steps into a consultancy role. The Dutchman has impressed during his five-year spell in charge of Ajax, drawing admiring glances from many top clubs. But some concerns have been raised about how Ten Hag would handle the step up to a club the size of Old Trafford. He has become used to working with shining young rough diamonds at the Johan Cruyff Arena, rather than the superstars a club of United’s stature are expected to possess. Despite those concerns, Ten Hag is still one of the favourites to be handed the job, which will involve a serious period of rebuilding. And to get that rebuilding underway, former Netherlands international Rene van der Gijp has given the Red Devils an astonishing tip. The former winger believes that United should sell top scorer Ronaldo and captain Maguire this summer. Van der Gijp hopes that would allow Ten Hag the best chance to succeed in his rebuild. “I did not expect it. Such a club also wants a sign, of course. He is not. A Zidane, for example, would be. He just needs to get rid of those troublemakers. Ronaldo, Pogba, Maguire. Ronaldo would get along fine with Zidane. They are on the same level,” Van der Gijp told Vendaag Inside. United only signed Ronaldo last summer, but the Portuguese attacker has been criticised for his poor body language across the current campaign despite scoring 18 goals in all competitions. Maguire meanwhile has endured a disappointing season, with his suitability for the role of United’s captain coming under question. Decisions over the duo’s future will be at the top of Ten Hag’s to-do list as he looks to turnaround the Red Devils. Whether he takes Van der Gijp’s advise remains to be seen, but it would be quite the statement of intent from a new manager.
