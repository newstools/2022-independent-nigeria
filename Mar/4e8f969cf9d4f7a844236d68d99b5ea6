The Delta State Government has called on the contractor handling the additional NEWMAP gully control project at Owanta in Boji-Boji Owa to expedite action to meet up with specified timeline. Chief Chris. Onogba, the state Commissioner for Environment, made the call while signing the Midoma/ Iwerebor-Owanta addendum contract at his office, Asaba, on Tuesday. Chief Onogba noted that the completion of the final phase of the Midoma/Owanta gully control contact project has become necessary for the smooth channelisation of drains water flowing from upper Powerline areas through Midoma/Iwerebor to Orogodo River. He said due to the severity of the gully and risk to humans, the contracting firm, Levant Construction Company, had to mobilise to site as early as possible to beat the one month contractual duration as contained in the agreement.
