ENUGU – The Commissioner of Police, Enugu State Command, Abubakar Lawal, has ordered the Deputy Commissioner of Police in-charge of the State CID to conduct a thorough and conclusive investigation into the story making the rounds on social media alleging that an Assistant Commissioner of Police and Area Commander in-charge of Enugu Metro Area Command, ACP Oluseyi Okenla, physically assaulted a female Police Officer, identified as Sergeant Helen Onoja, for no justifiable reasons. The investigation is in view of establishing the facts surrounding the allegations and apportioning appropriate disciplinary sanctions on whoever is found culpable. The CP in a statement made available to journalists in Enugu on Saturday, assured public that no stone will be left unturned in getting to the root of the matter and meting out appropriate sanctions, notes that the Nigeria Police Force remains a regimented and disciplined Agency of Government that has stopped at nothing to subject its personnel (male or female, or of senior or junior rank) to extant disciplinary codes, processes and punishments whenever they erred.
