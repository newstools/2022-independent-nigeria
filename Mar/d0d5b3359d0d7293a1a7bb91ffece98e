Ahead of the April deadline stipulated by the National Pension Commission (PenCom) for the closure of recapitalization of pension fund administrators (PFAs), numbers of the pension operators have already shrunk to 19 from 22, according to Daily Independent findings. This is against the backdrop of initial merger and acquisitions recorded so far since the announcement of the exercise last year. The acquisition of Investment One Pension Managers Limited by the Guaranty Trust Holdings Company Limited has now come under a new name, Guaranty Trust Pension Managers Limited.

Recall that the pension industry regulator, PenCom had, in a circular last year directed PFAs to raise their shareholders’ fund, giving them a 12-month transition period from N1billion to N5billion, a development that has prompted merger and acquisition consideration by the firms that may not be able to meet the N5billion minimum capital at the end of the exercise.
