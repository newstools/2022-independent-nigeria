Italian authorities have seized a superyacht worth $578 million from a Russian billionaire who was sanctioned by the the European Union following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Andrey Igorevich Melnichenko’s 470-foot Sailing Yacht A—believed to be the world’s biggest—has been sequestered at the northern port of Trieste, the Italian prime minister’s office said. Industrialist Melnichenko, who owns the fertilizer producer EuroChem Group and coal company SUEK, is among several prominent Russian oligarchs sanctioned by the EU since the start of the Ukraine War. Italian police said they had over the last week seized villas and yachts worth 143 million euros ($156 million) from five Russians on the sanctions list. Italian media released footage that reportedly showed Melnichenko’s yacht being seized.
