Less than two days after Armed bandits attacked a Kaduna bound train from Abuja, killing, injuring and kidnapping many, another set of armed terrorists Wednesday night stormed Kofar Gayan low-cost in Zaria Local Government Area of Kaduna state and kidnapped a customs officer, Mu’awiya Gambo and his Son, Samaila Mu’awiya. Independent gathered that the kidnappers trailed Gambo from his family house in Zaria city to his residence in the low cost, forced their way into the house and abducted him and his son between 8.30 and 9 pm. A resident of the area Mallam Surajo Garba disclosed that the kidnappers had also kidnapped four passersby on their way out of the community. He explained that two of the victims escaped and returned. It could be recalled that the bandits had stormed the customs officer’s house last year but could not kidnap him. A resident who confided in Daily Independent disclosed that nowhere is safe any longer in the state as he wondered what the federal and state governments are doing to curb such as everyone now lives in fear of attacks.
