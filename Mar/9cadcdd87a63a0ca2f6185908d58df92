Following our investigations and consultations with critical actors in the Secretariat of Esan North-East local government council, it has been discovered that our publication of September 11, 2021, titled: Exclusive; Genesis of the partitioning, looting of Esan North East, where one Comrade Igberaese granted our correspondent an interview accusing Mr. Joe Okojie of being part of those involved in the financial improprieties of the council was false and misleading. Though we had earlier removed the story from our website, this publication is however necessary to retract the story of September 11, 2021 and tender an unreserved apology to Mr. Joe Okojie for the embarrassment and inconveniences the said publication must have caused him, his family and supporters.The management of Olika Reporters Nigeria Limited, publishers of Truthlive.net hereby retract the story and apologise to Mr. Joe Okojie.
