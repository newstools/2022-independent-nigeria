A group, the Saraki Support Group, has faulted the Buhari Media Organisation (BMO) over its statement that the 8th Senate under the leadership of Bukola Saraki was a disaster. The group in a statement by its Director, Earl Osaro Onaiwu described Niyi Akinsiju and Cassidy Maduekwe who made the remark on behalf of BMO as ” failed professionals and bootlickers” who deliberately turned a blind eye to the fact that the Saraki-led Senate was adjudged to be the best since the return of democracy to Nigeria since 1999. “The attention of the Saraki Support Group (SSG) has been drawn to a statement signed by the duo of Niyi Akinsiju and Cassidy Maduekwe on behalf of the Buhari Media Organisation (BMO) where they alleged that the tenure of Dr. Abubakar Bukola Saraki as 13th President of Nigeria Senate was a disaster”. “We believe such a statement could only be signed by failed professionals and bootlickers who could not appreciate the work of the legislature in a democracy. Otherwise, Akinsiju and Maduekwe would not have made such an ignorant assessment of the Eighth Senate under Saraki which has been adjudged as the best Senate since the return of democracy in Nigeria in 1999. When we read their statement, the question that came to our mind is whether these people live in Nigeria or they reside in Siberia where they have no access to news about governance in Nigeria”. “The facts are there that the Eighth Senate passed the most bills since 1999 and they are not just ordinary bills. The bills passed by the 8th Senate are Bills that helped to give direction to the economy, strengthen the nation’s ability to tackle corruption, positively affect the lives of the people, and seek to make Nigerians secure”.
