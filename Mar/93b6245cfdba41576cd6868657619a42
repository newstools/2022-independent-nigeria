The upper chamber of the National Assembly has urged the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to allow duly registered and eligible prison inmates to vote during all general elections in Nigeria. The Senate made the appeal on Tuesday during the Plenary when it considered a motion on the prerogative of Prison Inmates to vote in general elections in Nigeria which was sponsored by Senator Abba Moro (Benue South). The Senate also urged the electoral umpire to determine the status of the inmates that are constitutionally and legally qualified to be registered as eligible voters, adding that INEC and relevant agencies should update the register of voters to take into account the prison population for the purpose of elections.

The chamber equally urged the commission and relevant agencies to carry out voter enlightenment in all prisons in Nigeria, to educate the inmates of their rights and the necessity to exercise their franchise in general elections. The lawmaker noted that being a prison inmate is not an impediment to the prisoners’ registration and voting rights as enshrined under Section 24 of the Electoral Act, 2022. He added that denying prison inmates access to the electoral process constitutes an infringement of their rights as citizens of Nigeria as provided under Section 25 of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, 1999 (as amended) which confirms the definition of who a citizen is as well as Section 12(1) of the Electoral Act, 2022 (as amended) which spells out who qualifies to vote.
