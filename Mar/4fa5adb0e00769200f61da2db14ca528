Mr Akande said that the vice president, based on his observations in the last seven to eight years, was driven by the notion that the government and governance and leadership ought to have a heart of justice and a heart of service. “He often says in most of the meetings that we hold that the reason why we are here is that people put us here. “ We are here in the interest of the people; so, he is someone that is committed to that notion of service to the people, whether in government, whether as a pastor, whether as a lawyer. POLL “In every aspect of his life, he understands very diligently the idea that we are here to serve.’’ He said that Mr Osinbajo had always emphasised the need to create impact for the people. According to him, the vice president is very inspiring and worthy of leadership. “As you can see there are many more Nigerians today that are yearning to say that this is the kind of man to follow. So, happy birthday, vice president,’’ he said.
