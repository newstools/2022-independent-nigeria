David de Gea has set out his short and long term ambitions at Manchester United. The Spaniard was left disappointed in midweek as his old club Atletico Madrid knocked United out of the Champions League and the Reds’ defeat means that they will go another season without a trophy at Old Trafford. Despite suffering a drought of team accolades, De Gea has won the club’s Player of the Year award on four occasions and would be happy to make it a fifth at the end of the campaign. However, there is still one long term ambition that he holds. When asked by a supporter in a United fans’ Q&A what it would mean to win the Player of the Year Award again, De Gea answered: “Yes, of course, it’s very special for me. I appreciate a lot the love of the fans and the support and, if I can win another one, it will be absolutely amazing. “But, to be honest, the first thing is to try to win big trophies as a team. That is the most important thing. “Of course [if you win, it means] you did a great season with great consistency and this is the most difficult thing in football, being very consistent. It would be, like I say, amazing to win it again, so let’s try.” He then added: “Yeah, I think, the whole season, I have been in a very good mode. I’ve been playing at a high level, helping the team as much as I can. “It’s true that sometimes people can forget the first games but I give 100 per cent every game and I think I’m doing very well this season and let’s finish properly as well.” United’s last remaining battle is for the final Champions League spot. They currently sit fifth, four points behind Arsenal who have a game in hand over them.
