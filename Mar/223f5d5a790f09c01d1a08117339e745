The Federal Airports Authority of Nigeria (FAAN) has withdrawn the On-Duty Card (ODC) of two officials of the Nigerian Immigration Service (NIS) at the Murtala Muhammad International Airport (MMIA), Lagos. The two officers whose identities were not revealed were also banned from working at any Nigerian airport. This followed the conclusion of the investigation of the allegation of extortion against the officers. Our correspondent reports that a woman had taken to Twitter to lament how her 14-year old daughter travelling on Qatar Airline on February 19 was extorted by collecting the sum of N8000 from her by officials of the service. Ag. General Manager, Corporate Affairs, Mrs. Faithful A. Hope-Ivbaze in a statement on Friday said following the allegation, a team of FAAN Aviation Security officers were commissioned to investigate the allegation. Upon investigation, she said they found the allegation to be true, as the officers involved were identified with the help of footage on the CCTV facility, and the cooperation from the Nigerian Immigration Service. She said, “Consequently, the officers were made to refund the exact amount collected from the passenger.“Their On Duty Cards were also withdrawn permanently, and they have been banned from working in any Nigerian airport, to serve as a deterrent to others. “We would like to commend the mother of the child, who has confirmed receipt of the money, for deeming it fit to escalate the case, and assisting us tremendously in the course of our investigation. POLL “Also, we would like to express our appreciation to the Comptroller of Immigration, MMA and her team for her cooperation and support in addressing this issue. “The authority will continue to identify and sanction any airport official (including FAAN officials) found to be extorting passengers or perpetuating any act of illegality at our airports.”
