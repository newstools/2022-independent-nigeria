Nollywood sweet­heart, Nancy Isime is in a relaxation mood, in between work, and has taken the time to high­light her love for restful breaks. According to the actress, being in the middle of nature, in the middle of “nowhere”, no social media, bare­ly any network, very limited interaction with humans, definite­ly brings out her most creative side. “Maybe I’m just a little too obsessed with Isolation in nature. I don’t know. Anyways, getting to rest a lot, eat a lot, play, journal, meditate, reflect, do some Yoga and pre­pare for the character I’m currently filming, in a place I totally enjoy was just the exact spice I needed. “I also got to do some executive producer work on my baby ‘The Nancy Isime Show’ ahead of our new season pre­miering really soon. Your Fa­vorite Talkshow is almost back on your screens with even more Juice than the last time Guys. Return date announcement soon,’ she wrote. According to the actress, tak­ing care of her mind, body and soul remains her number one priority “because I absolutely Love Me!”
