A young man was on Thursday burnt alive at Swali community in the Yenagoa Local Government Area of Bayelsa State. Sources said the young man was set ablaze by an angry mob after he was caught during an armed robbery operation in the area with three other gang members, who escaped. But the police said the young man was a suspected cultist and was set ablaze by some members of a rival cult group. The Police Public Relations Officer, SP Asinim Butswat, said this in a statement made available to journalists in Yenagoa. He said, “On 26 March 2022, at about 0630 hours Policemen responded to a distress call of cult-related clashes at Sand Road Swali, Yenagoa.
