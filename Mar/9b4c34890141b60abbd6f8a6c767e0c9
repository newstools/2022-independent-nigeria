A video has emerged showing locals clearing out a shopping mall in the Ukrainian city of Mariupol. People can be seen walking around with trollies and bags full of goods, as the city remains under siege by Russian forces. Local officials say residents are in dire need of food, water and medicine due to Russia’s blockade of the city.
