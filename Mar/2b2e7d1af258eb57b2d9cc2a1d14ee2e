Luck has a unique way of making a man seem invincible at what he does. In such a situation, everything he touches tends to work clockwise. Until a major change in the statuesque reveals the true position of the situation, people are even likely to compare him to a god of a sort or at least one with the Midas touch. Is Tunde Fowler Untouchable? Pain, Sorrow As Oba Saheed Elegushi Suffers Unimaginable Loss This appears to be the Cinderella tale that has surrounded the Chief Executive Officer and Group Managing Director of Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNPC) Limited, Mallam Mele Kyari for a while. Packaged as the messiah that would resolve Nigeria’s fuel challenge via NNPC, the biting fuel scarcity that has persisted has proven that Mallam Kyari is nothing close to the image being painted for him. After promising to make the fuel scarcity being experienced by Nigerians disappear, the queues in fuel stations in the country continue to linger, totally defying any logic, while looking like a tall order for the man at the helms of affairs at NNPC. For a man who has been painted as ‘Mr. Fix’ it, this is really disappointing.
