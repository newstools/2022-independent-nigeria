At least 20 people including women and children, on Wednesday, lost their lives in a boat mishap in River Shiroro in Niger State while trying to escape gunmen attacks on their community. It was gathered that gunmen, said to be numbering over 200, invaded Shayita community in Munya Local Government Area and in their usual manner, ransacked the entire community looting foodstuff and other valuables. The victims, according to a source close to the community, had received reports of an imminent attack and had begun to evacuate their belongings to relocate. According to our source, no fewer than ten boats took off from Shayita in Munya Local Government Area and headed to Zumba in Shiroro Local Government Area, when one of the boats capsized midway into their journey, leaving 16 people feared dead. The boat was said to be carrying about 60 people, mostly women and children with their belongings, trying to cross over to the neighbouring Zumba community when the unfortunate incident occurred. While some of the victims were rescued, many are still missing, fueling the possibility that the death toll could be more than 20, whose bodies have been recovered by local divers in the community. It was gathered that the rescue operation has been temporarily suspended by the locals as the gunmen closed up on the people, forcing them to not only suspend the rescue operation, but also abandoned the 20 bodies earlier recovered at the river bank and fled to safety.
