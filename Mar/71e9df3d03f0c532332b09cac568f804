Those who do good things for their enclave will always be recognised in their homestead. In what will go down in history as one of the most colourfully organised turbaning ceremonies, the people of Ilorin got more than they bargained for when the Emir of the ancient town, Alhaji Ibrahim Kolapo Sulu Gambari CFR officially rolled out the drums to decorate its new Dan Iyan of the town, Ilorin, Kwara State, Sulaiman Bolakale Kawu. Debonair public servant, Engineer Bolakale Kawu is the Director of Procurement at Rural Electrification Agency (REA), and his touching lives from his little corner. The occasion was time for many to reward his good deeds, which they did in spectacular fashion. Not few trooped after him to the Emir’s Palace for the turbaning ceremony in traditional style, peculiar to people of northern extraction. His new title, Dan Iyan means the head of all princes and princesses, a stripe Kale earned due to his blue blood from the Shita Ruling House. His deceased dad, Alhaji Kawu Agaka, was until his demise the secretary to the incumbent Emir. Alhaji Agaka also served the monarch’s father, late emir Zulukainani Gambari and the incumbent’s predecessor, late Aliyu Abdulkadir, better known as Baba Agba in various capacities and was a prominent figure in a traditional circle during his days.
