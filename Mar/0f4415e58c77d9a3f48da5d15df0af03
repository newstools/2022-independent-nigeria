Zamfara State Governor Bello Matawalle has urged All Progressives Congress (APC) governors to stop airing the dirty linens in the media in regards to the ongoing crisis in the party. Recall that Ondo State Governor Rotimi Akeredolu called out some governors in the party, tagging them as ‘yahoo yahoo’ for supporting the caretaker chairman of APC and Yobe Governor Mai Mala Buni. However, Matawalle in a statement issued by Zailani Bappa, his Special Adviser on Public Enlightenment, Media and Communications on Friday in Gusau, urged them to stop promoting disharmony among themselves. APC Holds Emergency NEC Meeting March 17 Umahi Vows To Deal With Ebonyi PDP, Says Buni Remains APC… The statement partly read, “It is not right for us to wash our dirty linens in the media, especially at this critical time of the party’s transformation as we move towards a decisive period in 2023. “I believe that each of us has been trying his best in his way to move the interest of our great party forward. “His Excellency, Gov. Mai Mala Buni has no doubt contributed immensely to the promotion of the party’s fortunes and indeed all other governors who disagreed with one another. “However, we all disagree to agree. That is the beauty of democracy. There is no point in promoting disharmony among ourselves after disagreements are settled. ”It is not wise to drag the name of His Excellency, Mr President into taking sides on issues that are ordinarily a normal political misunderstanding common to every collection of interests. POLL “Now, more than ever before, the party needs the strength and unity to face the challenges ahead as we move towards the critical period of elections of which the party must maintain its supremacy at all levels.”
