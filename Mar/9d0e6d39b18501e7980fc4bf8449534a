OVH Energy Marketing (Oando Licensee) has given recommendations on the development of the midstream and downstream oil and gas industry in Nigeria. At the recent 5thNigeria International Energy Summit (NIES) held in Abuja themed: “Revitalising the Industry: Future Fuels and Energy Transition”, Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of OVH Energy, Mr.Huub Stokman said the sector needs significant infrastructure investments. He also advocated increased collaboration amongst relevant stakeholders in the industry to develop on the necessary measures that can improve infrastructural development in the sector to meet customers’ needs. “On Midstream and Downstream infrastructural development, the industry needs more investment to expand and boost our jetties, the pipelines, depots, trucks and human capacity development for a safe operation. “We recognise that the industry needs more funding and investment to achieve all of these whilst customers’ demands are met and creating values to the end users.,” he said. He further stated that the new refineries will change the supply landscape, and Nigeria becoming self-sufficient in the production of refined fuel. This is a major milestone” According to Mr. Stokman, new refineries will produce cleaner fuels which are good for the environment, and for the good health of all Nigerians. The current challenge around fuel supply and distribution shows us that as an industry, we need to have a good emergency plan (the refineries go down for maintenance, what then do we do?). We should use today’s challenges as a learning opportunity for the future, he advocated.” He commended the Federal Government for the signing of the PIA and the swift response of the Authority Chief Executive in the implementation of the Act, however, he observed that the postponement of full deregulation of industry will pose a lot of challenges to the industry.
