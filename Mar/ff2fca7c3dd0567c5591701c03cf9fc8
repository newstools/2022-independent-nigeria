Kwara State Governor, AbdulRahman AbdulRazaq, on Wednesday said that he would not hand over the state to those he described as wolves, adding also that the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) can only repeat its own excellent record in the delivery of its campaign promises. The governor said this at the crowded Banquet Hall, GRA, Ilorin, at the inauguration of the Prince Sunday Fagbemi-led APC State Executive Committee in Ilorin. “We have the state capital,” the governor said, adding that Kwarans have “resolved not to ever hand the reins of government to wandering wolves and their allies.” The governor said that his administration, under APC, has made a mark in basic education, healthcare, public funded-safety net programmes, gender mainstreaming and youth empowerment. The inauguration was attended by the top echelon of the ruling party, including Deputy Governor Kayode Alabi; Speaker of the House of Assembly, Yakubu Danladi-Salihu and House members, members of the National Assembly; cabinet members, members of statutory commissions; and other critical stakeholders in the party. The governor said no true Progressives will leave the party under which Kwara is fast regaining its lost glories, adding that whatever disagreements among brothers can always be resolved if those involved are committed to the growth of the state. “Today represents a new beginning for our party in Kwara State. I congratulate all members of the new state executive committee. Let me remind you that this position is a trust. You now carry the mandate of over 400,000 members of APC in Kwara State to lead us to another victory,” Abdulrazaq said, drawing applause from the huge crowd. “You are coming on board at a crucial moment. No genuine Progressive, whatever the disagreements, will sabotage the collective resolve of the people of Kwara State to solidify the victory of 2019 in 2023.”
