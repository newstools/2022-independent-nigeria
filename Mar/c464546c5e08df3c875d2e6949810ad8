The Professionals Council of the All Progressives Congress (APC) has congratulated Sen­ator Abdullahi Adamu on his emergence as the national chairman of the party, urging him and other newly elected national officials to be mag­nanimous in victory. The professional council, in a congratulatory letter signed by its director general, Ambassador Seyi Bamgbade, urged the newly elected offi­cers to rise to the responsi­bilities bestowed on them by promptly mending broken walls and building collapsed bridges for the greater good of the party ahead of the 2023 general election. Bamgbade described Ab­dullahi Adamu’s consensus winning as historic, main­taining that his giant strides as chairman of reconciliation committee were still very fresh in the political history of the party, saying the coun­cil believed Senator Adamu would bring on board his ex­periences in politics to bear on the party. While joining party stal­warts, stakeholders and members of the party to re­joice with the new national chairman, and other elected party officials, the council strongly posited that their emergence at this critical po­litical era was nothing but a perfect match.
