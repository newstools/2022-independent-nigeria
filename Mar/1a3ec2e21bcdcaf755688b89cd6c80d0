Lagos – Kadiri Ikhana, the former Super Eagles star, has berated the Super Eagles for what he called a shameful outing following their inability to qualify for the 2022 World Cup in Qatar. The coach who spoke to our correspondent moments after the match at the MKO Abiola Stadium in Abuja where Nigeria forced Ghana to 1-1 draw, said it was shameful that the three times African champions failed to make it despite the mobilization and the preparations put into the match on Tuesday. The obviously angry former CAF Coach of the Year said Nigeria has no team at all, saying they should start afresh. “This is very shameful; it is the shame of a nation. How can we play so badly and fail to qualify for the World Cup? I am not underrating Ghana but this is our qualification to lose and we lost it. “I am very ashamed of this outing and we don’t have a team to call a good team; they should start afresh in whatever way they want to. “In fact I am very angry and wish not to talk to anybody right now because this team is just not it,” he said.
