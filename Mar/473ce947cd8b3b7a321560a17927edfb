African Christian journalists have set up a social media group called Network Of African Christian Journalists (NACJOURN). According to Dr. Bola Adewara, President NACJOURN, the aim was for the members to collaborate, especially in areas of education, sharing of information and expansion of knowledge. Already, it had lined up activities for the members through which they could speak to top personalities on current happenings in the society. Only last week, the group held a Zoom conference meeting with Pastor Ladi Thompson, a strategic thinker and security consultant, during which he lectured the Christian journalists on the essence of the Directorate of Politics and Governance set up by the Pentecostal Fellowship of Nigeria (PFN). Already, a media chat had been slated for the Christian journalists with Pastor Sunday Adelaja, a Nigerian cleric based in Kiev, Ukraine. During the conference, Pastor Adelaja would take the journalists on the facts behind the on-going Russia and Ukraine war. Also on April 3, 2022 the group would hold another media chat with one of the presidential aspirants, Mazi Sam Ohuabunwa. The chats would be broadcast live on Facebook and YouTube. POLL According to Adewara, “We need to start ‘drilling’ every political candidate in Nigeria. We should not allow anything to go.” He disclosed that other presidential aspirants to be engaged in such discussions, included Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu, Anyim Pius, Orji Uzor Kalu, and Atiku Abubakar, among others.
