LAGOS – Professor Kingsley Moghalu, a former Deputy Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) and 2023 presidential aspirant under the African Democratic Congress (ADC) party platform, has requested the presence of media organisations at a world press conference he is slated to host this week. The event, slated to hold on Thursday, 17 March 2022, at No. 8, Lake Chad Crescent, Maitama, Abuja, at 11 am, will address the multiple crises of leadership that are threatening to cause a general breakdown of the country’s socio-economic order – which has been degenerative as a result of the misgovernance of the past years – at a time of global geopolitical tension and economic instability. According to a press statement on Tuesday, signed by Jide Akintunde, Spokesperson, Moghalu4Nigeria Movement, the issues to be addressed include the rising inflation in Nigeria and its impact on the welfare of the people; unabating insecurity, featuring shrinking governed spaces and expanding ungoverned spaces; high unemployment – made more worrisome by a youth unemployment rate of over 40 percent and the continuing weakening of the education system, currently highlighted by the resumption of the strike by the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU). On the international front, the invasion of Ukraine by Russia is a geopolitical risk of a mammoth proportion. Beyond its impact on the domestic energy price through the higher landing cost of Premium Motor Spirt (petrol), the war in Ukraine can destabilise global markets and world peace. The statement noted that the world press conference will also address critical issues concerning the 2023 general elections in Nigeria.
