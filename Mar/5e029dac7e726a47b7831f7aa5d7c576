Premier League clubs have voted to allow five substitutes per game next season. A post-Covid rule change did permit sides to use five but the temporary rule was scrapped ahead of the current campaign. Newcastle United voted against five substitutions last summer, with the rule thought to benefit the ‘bigger’ clubs in the division. As of next year, managers can switch half of their outfield players if their team is performing poorly. This change brings England in line with the rest of Europe’s elite leagues – who kept the five-sub allowance following the pandemic.
