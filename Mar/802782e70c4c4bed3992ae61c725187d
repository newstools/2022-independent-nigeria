The Arewa Youth Consultative Forum, AYCF, has denied that the northern region is supporting the Presidential ambition of the national leader of the All Progressive Congress (APC), Bola Tinubu as claimed by the Governor of Kano State, Abdullahi Ganduje. Recall that Ganduje had disclosed that the north has endorsed Tinubu has their presidential choice for the 2023 elections. However, according to AYCF National President, Yerima Shettima to Daily Post, Ganduje was just airing his own opinion not speaking for the entire northern people.

This is an expensive joke, and he knows it’s not true. “Most of these guys believe that they can wake up and continue doing the same old things as regards politics; they believe that it’s what it was in the past. “We know what happened and how he survived being a governor of Kano apart from the advantage of the incumbency from the ruling party that came together to work and ensure that they find a soft landing for him to get to where he is. “So for this, he cannot be said to be speaking for the North. Lagos is different from the North. I wouldn’t blame him because most of them know that they are going into compulsory retirement in politics, so they can go to any length to say something that would ensure they remain to remain politically relevant. “But you and I know that what he said is not true. We know how he managed the situation during Asiwaju’s birthday in Kano; we know what happened at the State House.

Let them prove to Nigerians how popular they are among their constituencies.”
