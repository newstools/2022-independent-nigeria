Nigerian publisher, Omoyele Sowore, has described the national convention of the All Progressives Congress (APC), as a gathering of the most corrupt, wicked, unjust, and dishonest politicians. The presidential aspirant, under the platform of the African Action Congress (AAC), disclosed this on Saturday in a tweet via his official Twitter page, predicting that the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), will manage APC soon. Sowore wrote, “#APCConvention @OfficialAPCNg is the convening of some of the most corrupt, incompetent, wicked, unjust and dishonest men and women politicians the world has ever known! “And just so that you understand what we’ve being saying, @OfficialPDPNig will now manage @OfficialAPCNg.” Recall that APC’s National Convention is currently held at the Eagles Square in Abuja.
