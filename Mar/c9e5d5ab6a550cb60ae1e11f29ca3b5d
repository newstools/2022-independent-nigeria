Roberto Mancini had a long talk with the Italy squad at Coverciano today following the play-off defeat to North Macedonia. The Azzurri suffered a shock 1-0 loss to Igor Angelovski’s side last night at the Stadio Renzo Barbera in Palermo, meaning they’ll miss out on their second consecutive World Cup. Mancini’s side will now play Turkey in a friendly on Tuesday next week. As reported by Sky Sports, Mancini spoke to the Azzurri squad in the middle of the pitch at Coverciano just before today’s training session and he gave no signs of surrender following yesterday’s heartbreaking defeat. The Azzurri coach was reportedly very calm and seemed to suggest that he intends to remain in the role, instead of resigning. It remains to be seen if this is simply a strategy to keep things calm until after the friendly against Turkey. Mancini will speak at a press conference on Monday ahead of the upcoming friendly and his future will become significantly clearer then.
