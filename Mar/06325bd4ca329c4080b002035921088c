Boris Johnson has committed a football gaffe by suggesting Ukraine should be given a bye into the World Cup. The move would disadvantage Scotland, who are due to compete against Ukraine in a play-off semi final. The winner of this tie is due to play either Wales or Austria in a winner-takes all match to reach the finals. If Scotland qualified, it would be the first time the national team had played in the World Cup since the 1990s. But asked if Ukraine, which is at war with Russia, should be given a bye to go into World Cup in 2022, the Prime Minister said it “sounds like a good idea to me”. Columnist Alex Massie responded on Twitter: “It’s just possible he hasn’t quite thought this through.” Another journalist wrote: “This, i fear, may go down quite badly with Scotland.”
