The Leader of INRI Evangelical Spiritual Church, Primate Elijah Ayodele, has warned Governor Ifeanyi Okowa of Delta State about choosing a successor in 2023. In a statement signed by his Media Aide, Osho Oluwatosin, Primate Ayodele warned that Okowa may hand over to the wrong person if he doesn’t seek the face of God, noting that his successor will become his enemy and will betray him except he involves God. According to Ayodele, ‘’Governor Ifeanyi Okowa needs to seek the face of God in choosing his successor because I see him being led into EFCC net if he makes a mistake. ‘’As a human, he will definitely make mistakes and hand over to someone who will later become his enemy but with God, his eyes will be opened to choose someone who won’t bring bad tidings to Delta State and one who won’t be after him. ‘’He needs to involve God in the process if not, he will regret it. “The person you have in mind to choose will disappoint you, you will become enemies, do more consultations before concluding.”
