A  Federal High Court Judge in Abuja, Justice Inyang Eden Ekwo, has threatened to strike out the Federal Government’s N2.9 billion money laundering criminal charges filed against Senator Rochas Okorocha. Justice Ekwo made this threat on Monday, after FG’s counsel, Cosmos Ugwu, told informed the judge that he has not been able to see Okorocha and serve him with the charges. “Let me place on record, that this is the second time this flimsy excuse is being made to justify the absence of the 1st defendant (Okorocha) in court to take his plea. “As the prosecutor, you must demonstrate seriousness in the discharge of your duties. This is the last adjournment I shall grant in this matter. ” If on the adjourned date, you come up with the same flimsy excuses, I shall have no option than to strike out the charges,” the Judge said.. Recall that, Okorocha is to face trial alongside six others on 17-count charges involving criminal diversion of public funds and properties.
