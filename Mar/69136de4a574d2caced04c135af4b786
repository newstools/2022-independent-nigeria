Inter are serious about signing Juventus star Paulo Dybala and CEO Beppe Marotta has come up with a clear plan after opening talks with his agent. The 28-year-old Argentinian forward’s contract expires with the Bianconeri at the end of this season and his agent Jorge Antun will meet with the club on Thursday next week in order to discuss a possible renewal. The agent could also make the trip over to Lombardy; until now, Antun and Marotta have only spoken on the phone but they could pencil in a face-to-face meeting as well. As reported by La Gazzetta dello Sport, Inter can’t afford to offer as much as Juventus did to Dybala before Christmas – €8m net per season plus €2m in add-ons, lasting until 2026 – but they’re still desperate to sign the player. A lower offer from the Bianconeri would change things, and for now the Nerazzurri seem to be in luck.

Antun will listen to this proposal as well as taking the time to take stock of the Argentinian forward’s admirers; in addition to Inter, Tottenham, Atletico Madrid and Barcelona are all keen on the former Palermo man. Inter need to free up some resources before they can pull off the deal. The departures of Arturo Vidal and Matias Vecino, whose contracts expire in the summer, guarantee a total saving of around €16m gross per season. The possible sale of Lautaro Martinez would also give the Nerazzurri more room to manoeuvre. For now Inter need to wait until next Thursday to see how Dybala’s meeting goes with Juventus. Marotta is ready and wants to be re-united with the Argentinian once again, like he was seven years ago in Turin.
