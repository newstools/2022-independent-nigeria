Newspaper Proprietors’ Association Of Nigeria (NPAN) has condoled with the wife of the late publisher of Business Hallmark Newspapers over the demise of her husband, Prince Emeka Obasi, who passed on Wednesday, March 16, 2022. The group expressed shock over the news of Prince Obasi’s death describing him as a quintessential journalist and media guru who left a lasting legacy. NPAN in a letter signed by its President, Mr. Kabiru Yusuf, said Obasi’s death came at an unripe age. The letter reads in part: “Prince Emeka Obasi- Our Condolences.” It is with great shock that we received the news of the death of our brother, friend, colleague and your better half, Prince Emeka Obasi. His passage is more shocking, coming at an unripe age of 58 years. À quintessential journalist and media guru, Prince Obasi until his death, was a member of our esteemed association as the Publisher of Business Hallmark. Though Prince Obasi died in his prime, we are consoled by the enviable legacies he left within and outside our esteemed industry and the nation at large. We can not but recall his establishment of the National Mirror Newspapers, which he nurtured to the point that it attracted the attention of billionaire businessman, Jimoh Ibrahim, who bought it over. On behalf of the Executive Council of our esteemed Association, We commiserate with you, the Business Hallmark: Newspapers and your entire family. We pray that the Almighty God will console and uphold each one of you.”
