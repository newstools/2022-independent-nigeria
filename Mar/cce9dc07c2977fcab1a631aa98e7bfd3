A socio-political group in the north, Arewa Political Advocates (APA) has called on people it described as meddlesome interlopers to desist from fanning the embers of disunity within the fold of the People’s Democratic Party (PDP). The group also condemned the inflammatory remarks allegedly made by the Northern Alliance for National Cohesion at a press conference where it blamed the Rivers State Governor, Nyesom Wike for the brewing crisis with his Edo State counterpart, Godwin Obaseki. It would be recalled that both Governors Nyesom Wike and Godwin Obaseki have been involved in a battle of words in recent days. In a statement signed by Abubakar Yewa, coordinator of the APA, and made available to Daily Independent in Port Harcourt on Wednesday, the group blamed the crisis on the “disrespectful, unguarded, combative and confrontational comments” of the Edo state deputy governor, Phillip Shiabu. It expressed worry over the role played by some faceless groups which are aimed at escalating the crisis between the two PDP governors, adding that “the fearless, bold, determined, courageous, consistent and admirable public advocacy of Governor Nyesom Wike, has without any doubts whatsoever, transformed him into a champion of the Nigerian masses, a voice for the long-suffering common man and a true leader of the ordinary citizens of this country”. The northern group noted that Governor Nyesom Wike, unlike the majority of his colleagues, has stood out like a proud, towering colossus, who will not be cowed as he speaks truth to power and calls out those who must be called out, whether in his own Constituency, political party or the nation at large. It recalled how Governor Wike got involved in Edo State to make peace amongst the contending parties, after much pleading by both the Governor, his deputy and the national working committee of the PDP, which eventually paved the way for Governor Godwin Obaseki and his deputy, Phillip Shaibu to emerge victoriously. The group called on Governor Wike not to make any group with questionable intentions and dubious motives relevant by engaging them in issues that do not have the national interest as its objective, adding that Wike as “a leader we admire because of his guiding principles of sincerity, honesty and teamwork”. POLL It warned members of the PDP to be careful in this political season and put the interest of Nigeria first, even when “we have personal and political issues to settle”.
