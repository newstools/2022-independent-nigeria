The relationship between Mohamed Salah and Liverpool is not exactly healthy at the moment, with the Egyptian wizard rejecting almost every approach from the Premier League side over a potential renewal. Salah’s current deal at Anfield expires at the end of next season. While the player wants to continue at Liverpool, he is demanding a lucrative contract due to his spectacular performances since joining from AS Roma. Liverpool have been reluctant in meeting Salah’s demands so far, leading many to assume the player might be on his way out of Anfield in the summer. However, according to a report from Diario SPORT, Liverpool have no intention of offloading Salah in the summer even if they fail to reach an agreement with the winger. They are open to losing him on a free transfer in 2023 rather than allowing the player to leave in the summer. It is a gutsy move from the Merseyside giants, who have recently struck gold with the capture of Luis Diaz in January. It appears the Reds are hoping to make another such purchase in the summer and help him settle in slowly, whilst keeping Salah at the club. It could significantly ease up the transition on the right hand side, potentially handing Jurgen Klopp an entirely new front three. However, the report states Barcelona are trying everything they can to sign Salah in the summer. The player remains open to joining Camp Nou, though the financial implications could make it difficult for the Catalan, with the potential cost of the operation likely to be around €90 million. POLL Barcelona are yet to establish contact with Liverpool surrounding a potential deal for Salah. They believe the negotiations are going to be difficult, so a lot may depend on how much the club can extract from player sales this summer.
