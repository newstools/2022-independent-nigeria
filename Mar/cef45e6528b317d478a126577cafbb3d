Doguwa communities in Kano State have applauded Outspan Nigeria Limited, the dairy business unit of Olam Food Ingredients (ofi), for its expansive investment in the area, targeted at achieving large-scale development of the local dairy value chain. At the opening of the latest Milk Collection Centre (MCC) in Falgore, Doguwa LGA bankrolled by Outspan, representatives of the communities under the local government area said the investment would stimulate a robust local economy, create linkages for smallholder dairy farmers and generate jobs in the area. Mamuda Hudu, the Chairman of Doguwa LGA, was delighted by the prospect of local dairy farmers and the women in the area gaining access to new markets and opportunities to sell their milk to large industrial off-takers instead of trekking to distant towns to peddle their products. “Outspan Nigeria Limited is making an impactful investment in our communities by building a milk collection centre in Doguwa LGA. The collection centre will enhance the economic activities of our local dairy farmers and help our young people get jobs in the dairy value chain,” Hudu said “Our women who previously trekked miles to sell their milk in distant markets can now stay home and look after their children with the assurance that the milk collection centre would help preserve and transport their raw milk to larger off-takers who are ready to pay them accordingly In the same vein, Alhaji Hamza Ahmed Hamza, the traditional head, Falgore village, thanked Outspan for locating an MCC in the village.
