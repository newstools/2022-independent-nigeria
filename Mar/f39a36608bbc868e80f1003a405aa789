The Governor of Sokoto State and presidential hopeful on the platform of the People’s Democratic Party (PDP), Aminu Tambuwal has said that he will ensure the implementation of state policing across the country if elected the President of Nigeria in the 2023 general election. Tambuwal who spoke on Channels Television’s Politics Today declared that state policing is essential to solving Nigeria’s insecurity problem. He said, “I have an idea of what to do (to fix insecurity), “We must take it to the community level. We must go and address the issue of state policing and get security closer to the people.” When asked if he will present a state policing bill to the National Assembly as President, Mr Tambuwal answered in the affirmative. He said, “If it means me Aminu Tambuwal as the President of Nigeria taking the bill personally to President of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Reps, I will do so. Because I believe it is one of the interventions that we need as a matter of urgency to nip the issues of security challenges in the bud.” Daily Independent reports that Tambuwal challenged the idea of PDP zoning the party to the South. He stressed that competency, not regionalism, should be the main consideration for choosing a presidential candidate. The Governor also acknowledged that he was in talks with other presidential aspirants in the PDP with the hopes of reaching a consensus.
