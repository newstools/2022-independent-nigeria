PSG midfielder Leandro Paredes has emerged as a possible target for José Mourinho’s Roma, with the Special One who already tried to sign the Argentinean at Tottenham. Paredes, a former Roma midfielder, is not a regular starter at the Parc des Princes and according to Calciomercato.com, the Giallorossi are considering reuniting with their ex-star. His contract expires in June 2023 and Roma director Tiago Pinto was spotted in Paris this week. According to the report, Paredes’ agents are also in the France capital, while the midfielder is on international duty in Argentina. It is still unclear whether Pinto met the representatives of the 27-year-old, but what can be taken for granted is that Mourinho is an admirer of the Argentina international. The Special One wanted to bring him to Tottenham in the past, but the North Londoners failed to secure a deal to sign him. With barely one year left in his contract with PSG, Roma hope to secure his services in the summer. Paredes’ €7.5m-a-year deal may be too much for the Giallorossi, but the growth decree would help them get a tax discount on the player’s gross salary. Mourinho is looking for a new deep-lying playmaker and Arsenal’s Granit Xhaka is another player on his agenda.
