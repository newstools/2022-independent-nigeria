In the wake of his admission that he was more than just friends with late singer, Goldie, popular media personality Denrele Edun has come under fire from Nigerians on social media. In a recent interview on Instagram, Denrele revealed that while others thought he was ‘just’ friends with Goldie, they had some intimate moments even though he knew she was married. He said, “I have not shared this anywhere but I can as well say it here. My beautiful late friend, Goldie, a lot of people just thought we were friends but we did have a few intimate moments and that is why I will say that I was the driving force; God bless her soul, she is resting in power. I knew she was married, of course, we kept that secret. But we had what was more than friendship. We had a few moments ‘you know, we entered the corner.’” Reacting to his comments, a Twitter user, Dr Rayo Wright noted that Denrele may or may not have had intimate relations with Goldie, but the fact that he chose to bring a private issue to the public shows he lacks integrity. “Maybe you had sex with Goldie. Maybe you didn’t. Maybe u’re homosexual, bisexual, or heterosexual. Completely beside the point. The issue is you openly discussed private matters with a dead friend. That’s an integrity issue. Don’t share secrets with Denrele. Do it at ur peril,” he wrote. His was among the many unsavoury comments thrown at Denrele on social media. The OAP has however noted that his use of the word intimacy was taken out of context. He wrote; “Intimacy has been misconstrued! Why does everyone think intimacy connotes sex? What a Horny Frequency! Either ways, intimacy in this context means ‘Shared Secrets’ and ‘One Corner’ denotes ‘even catching me with someone in the Corner’. Igboro na Street. We don enter trenches severally!”
