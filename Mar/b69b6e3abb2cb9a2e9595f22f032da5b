American rapper, actor, and businessman 50 Cent is threatening to take the ‘Power’ universe off Starz because his latest offering, ‘Power Book IV: Force’, has not yet been renewed. The series made its debut on Feb. 6 to record ratings for the cabler, but the hip-hop mogul says the show is sitting “in limbo.” The ‘Power’ Executive Producer shared his dismay in a string of Instagram posts Tuesday. He began with a video of a man shoving items into a suitcase and included the caption: “This is me packing my stuff, STARZ sucks, my deal is up over here I’m out. They renewed ‘Hightown’ and ‘Force’ is the highest-rated show [but] they have it sitting in limbo. If I told you how much dumbs— I deal with over here.” I Sold Akamu, Agidi To Survive — Kanayo O.

The crime series stars Monica Raymund as a National Marine Fisheries Service agent trying to get sober. However, “Force,” which follows Tommy Egan as he jockeys to become Chicago’s biggest drug kingpin, has not yet been renewed for a second season.
