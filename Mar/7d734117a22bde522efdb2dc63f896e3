As Ghana High Commissioner Assures of Warm Reception In Kumasi The Governments of Nigeria and Ghana have assured of hitch free 2022 FIFA World Cup playoffs between both countries later this month. The Sports Minister of Nigeria, Sunday Dare and Ghana High Commissioner to Nigeria, His Excellency, Rashid Bawa, gave these assurances in Abuja on Wednesday. Mr Bawa had paid a courtesy visit on the Sports Minister in his office to deliberate on areas of interest as the dates for the crucial playoff games draw closer. Dare said that Nigeria would continue to maintain the long standing relationship with Ghana and the tension around the playoff games would in no way jeopardize it. “These games should be seen as sports where there is the possibility of winning as there is of losing,” Dare said, adding, “We need to demonstrate the spirit of sportsmanship. We must not see the games as a do or die affair but rather as an avenue to further strengthen the bond that exists already between us. “President Muhammadu Buhari has identified sports as a tool for promoting unity and peace, not only within Nigeria but across the World so you can be assured of our hospitality and large heartedness,” the Minister added.
