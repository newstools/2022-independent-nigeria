Thomas Tuchel has insisted Chelsea have too many injury worries to catalogue the players who could miss Wednesday’s FA Cup fifth-round trip to Luton. Chelsea went into Sunday’s Carabao Cup final against Liverpool with their best injury situation in months, with everyone finally fit, bar long-term knee injury absentee Ben Chilwell. But Andreas Christensen and Hakim Ziyech were late withdrawals even before kick-off at Wembley, with Cesar Azpilicueta then hobbling out of the defeat and Trevoh Chalobah suffering a nasty cut to his groin.

Chelsea’s fatigue after extra-time and their eventual 11-10 penalty shoot-out defeat has taken another heavy toll on the Blues squad, leaving Tuchel loath to itemise all the doubts for Wednesday’s Kenilworth Road encounter.
