The Lagos State Government has warned motorists queuing up for fuel at filling stations to be orderly and not hinder the movement of others on the road. Commissioner for Transportation, Dr Frederic Oladeinde frowned at the disorderliness of some drivers, who queue haphazardly and disrupt traffic flow around petrol stations. While he sympathized with motorists who are enduring the pains of the fuel shortage being experienced across the country; he noted that it is not an excuse to block roads and impede traffic flow.

The Commissioner disclosed that traffic regulatory agencies had been directed to ensure free movement of vehicles and apprehend anyone that disrupts traffic around petrol stations as any vehicle left on the road will be impounded. “The excuses of faulty and unserviceable condition of vehicles are not tenable, as such, motorists should always certify the status of their automobiles before putting them on the road. We want our roads to be free; we do not want fuel queues to constitute a burden for other road users in Lagos,” he said.
