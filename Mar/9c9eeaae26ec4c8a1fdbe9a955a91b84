Nigeria Ambassador to Mexico, Hon. Adejare Bello has admonished the 2018 governorship candidate of the People’s Democratic Party (PDP), Senator Ademola Adeleke to defer his ambition till 2026 to get acceptance of good people of the state. He explained that Adeleke must wait till 2026 to allow Governor Adegboyega Oyetola to complete his second term in office. Adejare, a two-term Speaker of the Osun House of Assembly made these known on Monday while featuring on a popular Yoruba Show on Radio, “Oro Oselu” as monitored in Osogbo. He said that the incumbent Governor has done creditably well and he deserves to be returned for a second term. He acknowledged some of the developmental strides that the Administration of Governor Oyetola had made in the last three years, particularly in Ede Federal Constituency, saying, the West Agenda is a failed agitation at the moment in view of the current political permutations. Bello also expressed gratitude to Oyetola for saving him and his colleagues from the constituency from the embarrassment resulting from their inability to facilitate the reconstruction of the 20km Ejigbo-Ara-Ede road for the 20 years they spent cumulatively as speakers. He said, “Governor Oyetola has removed the tag of bastards on the political leaders from Ede Federal Constituency. As we all know, Professor Mojeed Alabi from Ejigbo spent four years as Speaker. Najeem Salaam also from Ejigbo spent eight years as Speaker. “I am from Ede and I spent eight years as Speaker. What we could not facilitate in our 20 years of cumulative service as Speakers, Governor Oyetola has done it for us within two years of his administration.” POLL The Ede-born politician however reassured the people of the State of the commitment of Governor Oyetola-led Administration to transform the State
