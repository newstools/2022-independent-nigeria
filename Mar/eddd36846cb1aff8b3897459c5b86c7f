A new Covid-19 variant has been detected in Israel, according to the country’s health ministry, who said they were unaware of the variant having been identified elsewhere in the world. The strain is a combination of two sub-variants of Omicron, and was detected in two passengers arriving at Ben Gurion airport. The ministry said there was no reason to suggest the variant could cause more severe illness than the globally dominant Omicron variant. “The two cases of the combined strain, which have been discovered so far, suffered from mild symptoms of fever, headaches and muscle dystrophy, and do not require a special medical response,” the ministry said, adding that it was not aware of the strain being discovered elsewhere. Israel’s pandemic response chief, Salman Zarka, played down the risks. “The phenomenon of combined variants is well known,” Mr Zarka told Army Radio. “At this stage, we are not worried about it leading to serious cases”. More than four million people out of Israel’s population of 9.2 million have received three coronavirus vaccine shots. A total of almost 1.4 million cases of Covid infection, including 8,244 deaths, have been officially recorded in the country. POLL Last month, Israel announced that unvaccinated tourists would be allowed to enter as part of an easing of covid restrictions. The country was seeing a “consistent decline in morbidity data,” Prime Minister Naftali Bennett said. A previous effort to reopen the border last November foundered after just a few weeks because of the fast-spreading Omicron variant. Israel was one of the first countries to launch a national vaccination campaign in December 2020. Earlier this month, the government announced it would provide fourth Covid vaccine shots to people over 60 and health workers, amid a surge driven by the Omicron variant.
