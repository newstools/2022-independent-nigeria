LAGOS – The Professionals Council of the All Progressives Congress (APC) has congratulated Senator Abdullahi Adamu on his emergence as the National Chairman of the progressive party, urging him and other newly elected national officials to be magnanimous in victory. The professional council, in a congratulatory letter signed by its Director-General, Ambassador Seyi Bamgbade, urged the newly elected officers to rise to the responsibilities bestowed on them by promptly mending broken walls and building collapsed bridges for the greater good of the party ahead of the 2023 general election. Bamgbade described Abdullahi Adamu consensus winning as historical, maintaining that his giant strides as Chairman of Reconciliation committee were still very fresh in the political history of the party, saying the council believe that Senator Abdulahi Adamu will bring on board his experiences in politics to bear on the party. While joining all-party stalwarts, stakeholders, and members of the party to rejoice with the new national chairman, and other elected party officials, the council strongly posited that their emergence at this critical political era was nothing but a perfect match. Bamgbade expressed optimism that the Senator Abdullahi Adamu-led executives would take the party forward judging by his antecedent as astute administrator with high acumen for managing men, interests, and resources. ‘’The APC- Professionals Council, is a party’s support group founded solely to help in strengthening the party by guiding and providing professional solutions to the challenges facing the nation and to promote progressive agenda of the party and Mr. President, His Excellency Muhammadu Buhari. ‘’We call on anyone who might be ‘aggrieved’ from the fall out of the exercise to give peace a chance and prioritize the greater good of the party and toe the reconciliation process of the party to resolve any differences within the internal democratic machinery embedded in the party’s constitution and the extant laws rather than causing avoidable crisis as history would not forget,’’ he said.
