Rivers State Governor, Nyesom Ezenwo Wike has revealed that the presidential aspirants for the 2023 general election in the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) are responsible for the party’s failure in 2015. Wike disclosed this after announcing his intention to run for the presidency in Makurdi, Benue State following a meeting with PDP stakeholders on Sunday. The Governor said, “Those who want to be President now were the problems of the party in 2015. They ran away when the party needed them the most. “But I have stood and worked for this party. I have nowhere to run to because I take it personally that the party should not die. And I challenge anyone in a debate what they did for PDP.”
