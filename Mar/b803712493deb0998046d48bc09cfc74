MAGNUS ONYIBEAgitating for secession from Nigeria ostensibly owing to marginalisation, some Igbos, under the auspices of Movement For Actualisation of The Sovereign State of Biafra, MASSOB and Independent People Of Biafra, IPOB have been vociferously making their case.The operator of the unlicensed Radio Biafra being used to mobilise support for the cause, Nnamdi Kanu has been detained by govt authorities for several months without bail and the apparent unconstitutionality of the measure along with their determination to mark the day the state of Biafra was declared, are fueling bloody clashes between the self-rule agitators and govt security agencies with avoidable human fatalities on both sides.In the light of the sad circumstances described above, ethnic nationality agitators in the southeast are in ICU for daring to exercise their right to express their opinion and desire for self-rule. Considering that freedom of expression is one of the fundamental and core values of democracy, the military may have a lot of explaining to do, which is why l would suggest they also arm themselves with video cameras so that they can have evidence to prove that the protesters were armed and thus compelled the application of deadly force to disperse them. A claim that protesters vehemently dispute. In the absence of such evidence, the claim that protesters were shot at by the military in self-defense would be hollow.Almost thirty years after the Tiananmen Square massacre of pro-democracy protesters by the Chinese military, the communist govt, is still trying to come to terms with the ruthlessness and recklessness with which a protest by unarmed civilians was quelled. By the same token, the German soldiers who perpetrated the Jewish genocide about 100 years ago are still being held accountable for the crime.If any keen observer of developments in Nigeria, that is less charitable, should conclude that our dear country is now like a war theatre and Nigerians are in ICU where war casualties usually end up, that judgment may not be wrong.”Beyond being in an ICU, and to be fair to the authorities, l concluded the analysis by highlighting the fact that the leadership of our country is also facing other existential threats which have stretched the ability and capacity of the law enforcement agencies. “Of course, Nigeria can be said to be at war on three and a half fronts:(1) with Boko Haram in the northeast, (2) with militants in Niger Delta creeks, and (3) with MASSOB/IPOB in the southeast plus battle against Fulani herdsmen whom President Buhari recently gave security authorities marching order to rein in although the minister of interior, General Abdulrahman Dambazau insists it remains a police action.This is in spite of the fact that statistics from the Global Terrorism Index in 2015 indicate that Fulani militants killed 1,229 people in 2014 up from 63 in 2013.When the dramatic increase from 63 to 1,229 in one year is extrapolated, and considering the recent spate of killings in Benue, Ogun, Ekiti, Delta, and Enugu states, the number must have increased to at least 5,000 innocent Nigerians by now. If such massive decimation of human lives don’t deserve military action to curtail, how can the use of deadly military force against apparently unarmed Biafran state protesters be justified?”Is it not remarkable that the above article that l just reproduced in this piece was published on June 6, 2016? That was about 6 years ago and barely one year after President Buhari took the mantle of leadership in Aso Rock Villa. It is disheartening that the atmosphere of insecurity that earned Nigeria the ignoble tag of  ICU 6 years ago has not changed for the better  in any significant manner. Rather, the situation has even worsened. Now, let us pivot from the ignoble and scandalising state of life expectancy in Nigeria owing to poorly resourced health care services and criminality that have now spread like cancer nationwide to the dimension of financial crimes that are also bedeviling our nation.Even if we decide to discountenance the horrific experience of our youths engaged in the gig economy (working independently for short term commitment) in the hands of the despotic police unit known as SARS (now disbanded) whose penchant for killing innocent youths and stripping them of their wealth on unproven allegations of engaging in advance fee fraud, (also known as 419) culminating in the bloody street protests by youths tagged #Endsars in October 2020, our country still fits into the mold of a massive crime scene.The violence sparked by the resistance of the youths practically crippled the country for a couple of weeks. The aftermath reverberated to the extent that it became a source of a major spat between the Cable News Network, CNN which reported that several youths were killed when the Nigerian army allegedly opened fire on the protesting youths that had gathered at Lekki toll gate in defiance of the curfew aimed at putting an end to the riots to which the protests had degenerated.That unfortunate incident, no matter the prism applied in its assessment is another blithe and justification for branding Nigeria as a massive crime scene. Also, think of the international dimension which Nigeria as a massive crime scene has morphed into by focusing on the current Huspuppi and Abba Kyari conundrum.While Huspuppi, (whose real name is Ramon Abbas) the confessed serial internet fraudster has been extradited from his location in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, UAE to the USA to face the consequences, his alleged accomplice, DSP Abba Kyari, a highly decorated ‘super cop’ is in the process of being similarly dispatched to the USA to defend himself or face the music.Shockingly, and as if to further affirm that our country has become a theatre of the absurd, the same DCP Abba Kyari has been implicated in the stealing and reselling of seized narcotics by the Nigerian Drug Law Enforcement Agency, NDLEA.***Not a few Nigerians believe that there are many more Hushpuppis engaging in internet fraud in our society who are yet to be apprehended and ‘super cops’ like Abba Kyari that have gone rogue in our law enforcement agencies that need to be fished out.*** If such despicable activities highlighted above do not make Nigeria a massive crime scene, what could?The United Nations Educational and Scientific Fund, UNICEF, reckons in its recent report that over 10.5 million Nigerian children are out of school due to conflicts ranging from religious insurgency, herdsmen/farmers conflicts, and separatist agitations ravaging the country. Ex-president Obasanjo at the Murtala Mohamed Memorial lecture held in Abuja on Tuesday, February 21 declared that the number of out-of-school children is Fifteen (15) million. He then posited that such young school dropouts today are likely to swell the ranks of religious insurgents, bandits, and outlaws generally in the next 10-15 years if they remain uneducated and unemployable.And l concur. Chidi Anselm Odinkalu, said it best in 2014, when as chairman of the governing council of the Nigerian Human Rights Commission while addressing Women For Peace, an NGO pursuing the release of Chibok schoolgirls stolen by the notorious religious insurgents, Boko Haram, underscored the significance of recovering the girls:“These Chibok girls are young people. As our next generation, they are the guarantors of the continuity of our race and country. They’re, therefore, not just “our” girls; they’re our future. If we cannot protect our future, then we fail ourselves and our ancestors.”After the Chibok girls’ ordeal, many more school boys and girls have been seized from their hostels and dormitories by bandits, forcing hordes of schools in the north too, (in the apprehension of the outlaws) shut down to avoid being the next victims. Thankfully, most of the Kidnapped school kids have presently been freed and the epidemic of stealing children from school has abated. Be that as it may, the situation in our country that categorises it as a massive crime zone even gets grimmer by the day.Instead of sharing with Nigerians the number of children being enrolled in schools to show that UNlCEF’s concern about the alarming number of out-of- school children especially in the north is being addressed, the Kaduna state government periodically reports a staggering record of people in the state that have died owing to conflicts arising from the intractable religious insurgency or banditry as the authorities have chosen to tag the nefarious ambassadors. In the course of the weekly ministerial press briefing organised by the Presidential Communications Team at the presidential villa, Abuja last Thursday (February 24) governor Nasir El-Rufai revealed that there has been a deterioration in the rate of insecurity of life and properties in Kaduna state.The governor who is the state’s chief security officer pointed out that, while 937 were killed and 1,972 kidnapped by bandits in the state in 2020, a total of 1,192 were killed and 3,348 were kidnapped in 2021. The statistics indicate that about 200 more lives were lost in Kaduna in 2021 than in 2020.The wanton waste of lives by the outlaws in Kaduna state is just a fraction of the death toll stemming from a mixture of religious extremism and outright criminality that have enveloped our country in the past decade beginning with the kidnap of schoolgirls in Chibok, Borno state. If other state governors in the north were to report the death toll in their jurisdictions as Governor Nasir El-Rufai of Kaduna state does, the number would be benumbing.Given that our country is not officially at war, and such a huge number of souls are being lost on a daily basis, certainly, the nation can be described as a massive crime scene. There is also the dimension of the financial crimes being perpetrated in most of the government agencies regarded as cash cows such as the NNPC, NDDC, NPA, NIMASA, and the likes which makes Nigeria a massive crime scene since those agencies have become a cesspit of corruption. For lack of space, I will not dwell on the fraud in NDDC, NPA, NIMASA which is stinking.But I will concentrate on the monumental financial sleaze swirling around the NNPC which generates about 95% of Nigeria’s foreign exchange earnings and accounts for about 50% of government revenue.The menace of crime in the economic sector being perpetrated against our country by local and international crime syndicates pushing Nigeria to its brink also makes the nation a massive crime scene. In a riveting reporting by BusinessHallmark-an economic matters focused newspaper, the reporter made the following revelation: “Only recently, an oil trading company, Samano Sa De CV, wrote a letter to the Group Managing Director of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation, Mele Kyari, demanding a five percent reward for exposing the diversion and theft of 48 million barrels of crude oil.At the current price of global crude oil which is $43 per barrel, (currently, the stolen oil is expected to be worth $2.06bn. The alleged theft is said to have taken place in 2015.”Writing further, the Business Hallmark made the case that: “Long seen and widely considered as the single most important cash cow in the land, the NNPC today is finding that it plainly has to reform or be reformed. While it has for long been used to calling the shots, it is now under immense pressure to explain itself. In the past few weeks, its top brass has been dragged to the National Assembly to provide explanations on the operations of the corporation. It also makes the case that: “In one such appearance, the focus of inquiries was the drilling cost of crude with the corporation having to explain why its figures were above the global equivalent.There have also been questions about the profitability of the corporation. Within the past weeks presumed audit documents were leaked to the public indicating that at least one of the refineries ostensibly being managed by the corporation, the Kaduna Refinery and Petrochemical Complex, KRPC may have expended as much as N65billion while at the same time posting zero revenues”Somehow, the matter has now simmered with the protagonists taking the battle to the USA -a new frontier where they are, like a chameleon adorning a new identity with the aim to leverage US legal system to inflict lethal legal assault on Nigeria. But what gave such an international crime syndicate the impetus to initiate such a nefarious activity in our clime? Considering that a similar scam involving PI&D another international firm with a questionable record recently occurred in NNPC, our country cannot justifiably deny that the atmosphere that fosters such criminality is prevailing here.As the saying goes, there is no smoke without fire. On top of all that mess, a whooping sum of N3 trillion has just been set aside in budget 2022 as subsidy for petrol. And the authorities have not been able to ascertain the quantity of Premium Motor a Spirit, PMS that motorists use on a daily basis-a figure that has been ranging between 33m in 2012 to the 66m liters per day currently being bandied around.That our country is on the verge of becoming broke and about N3 trillion is being allocated in the 2023 budget to fund consumption of petrol by motorists is befuddling and antithetical to rational thinking. How many Nigerians own cars? Assuming N3 trillion is domiciled in a federal mortgage bank to be offered as a loan/facility to the masses, can you imagine how many Nigerians would become first-time homeowners in the next few years? Consider the trickle-down effect in terms of employment for construction workers and ancillary services.Without engaging in critical thinking, our political leaders have elected to literally burn N3 trillion by channeling it into the phantom called petrol subsidy. On Monday, February 6, 2022, the IMF projected that Nigeria’s debt service-to-revenue ratio would jump to 92 percent in 2022 from 76 percent in 2021.How flabbergastingly absurd? Allow me to break it down for easy assimilation.Can readers imagine what would become of a man who spends 92% of his income servicing debt? How does he meet other essential needs such as a roof over his head, feeding, and clothing himself as well as taking care of his medical bills? That is assuming that he does not have a wife and children to cater for. The forgoing is a simple analogy of the dire straits in which our country is currently caught up.Against the backdrop of the gargantuan burden that the incoming president in 2023 would inherit and grapple with, is it not confounding that so many Nigerians are jostling to succeed president Buhari next year? That much is captured in my new book: “Becoming President Of Nigeria” (with the foreword written by professor Bolaji Akinyemi) that is currently being printed.By the time the political parties’ conventions for picking presidential candidates are held by both the ruling and main opposition parties in the coming months, the economic management capacity and ability of the candidates must be a core value that voters would look out for in the person who they would choose to lead them as president out of the tempestuous socioeconomic waters in which our ship of state is presently sailing.Since the next president already has his job cut out for him, it is perhaps why the best man for the job of president of Nigeria in 2023 must be someone who can read a balance sheet.In the light of the above assertion, amongst the motley crowd of presidential hopefuls, a couple of the candidates are already standing out in both the ruling APC and the main opposition party, PDP. With, the Independent National Election Commission, INEC releasing the guidelines and timetable for the 2023 general elections last Saturday, 26/2/22, which is commendably only a day after President Buhari assented to the much awaited electoral act 2022 on Friday, 25/2/22, the dice is now cast for politicking to commence in earnest as the electoral reforms that would make the process less rancorous, dangerous and unattractive to men and women of goodwill, have been instituted.And as the saying goes, the ball is now in the court of Nigerians to pick and choose the messiah that would rescue and lead them out of the massive crime scene that our beloved country has become lately.
