Inter Milan are interested in signing Manchester United striker Edinson Cavani as a replacement for Alexis Sanchez. As reported by Gazzetta Dello Sport, Inter are targeting Cavani, who is out of contract at the end of June. Barcelona have also been linked with a move for Cavani, who remains highly sought after despite being 35 years old. Inter are looking to bolster their attacking options and former United forward Sanchez could be allowed to depart. Cavani has scored two goals in 17 appearances for United this season, with injuries restricting his playing time. Last season he got 17 goals in 39 games for United. The Uruguayan could be tempted by a return to Serie A, where he previously played for Napoli and Palermo. Atletico Madrid’s Luis Suarez and Dries Mertens of Napoli have also been linked with Inter. United’s other attacking options include Cristiano Ronaldo, Marcus Rashford and Anthony Elanga. POLL Cavani joined United in October 2020 and signed a new one-year deal last year. However, he could depart on a free transfer at the end of the season.
