LAGOS A real estate company, Grant Properties Limited, has urged the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) to determine how much it owes the Asset Management Development Company of Nigeria (AMCON). The firm, in a petition by its Managing Director/Chief Executive Officer (CEO), Dr. Olawunmi Olajide-Awosedo to EFCC Chairman Abdulrasheed Bawa, said it had repaid its N8.5 billion debt to AMCON. The company said AMCON, in a January 27, 2015 letter, stated that the balance of the firm’s debt was N6.5 billion. Grant Properties said after AMCON took over its properties and homes, it informed the company that its debt was N8.5 billion, including all recovery expenses. “Shortly after this, they said the debt would be increased to N22 billion ‘based on your posture’. “On 2nd October, 2018, they wrote that the debt was N23 billion. “On 21st August 2019, they wrote that the debt was now N17.6 billion (based on a debt of N12.966 billion from a judgment, and N4.68 billion being claimed in a suit before the Federal High Court.” Grant Properties believed it was “mathematically impossible for the debt to have grown to N22 billion, N23 billion or N17.6 billion.” The firm added: “We also hold that even if the debt due was N17billion as claimed in their most recent demand (on 21st August 2015), then we have paid it in full, with a significant excess of our assets in the hands of AMCON.” POLL Urging the EFCC to intervene, the firms claimed that assets taken from it and sold by AMCON were worth over N50billion “which is more than adequate to settle the debt.”
