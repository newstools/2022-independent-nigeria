Simone Inzaghi has hailed Liverpool as the ‘best team in Europe’ following his sides elimination in the Champions League on Tuesday evening. The Inter Milan manager also admitted he harboured regrets after matching the Reds for the majority of the two-legged tie but ultimately falling short. The Italian side beat a lacklustre Liverpool 1-0 at Anfield on Tuesday evening thanks to a fantastic Lautaro Martinez strike, but couldn’t muster up the quality to level the aggregate score and ultimately petered out – thanks in part to Alexis Sanchez’ red-card just two minutes later. They also had the better of the first-leg at the San Siro but failed to take their chances before Jurgen Klopp’s men struck two sucker punches courtesy of Roberto Firmino and Diogo Jota. “There are certainly great regrets, as we wanted to reach this Round of 16 with all our strength,” Inzaghi said to Sky Italia. “We were up against Liverpool, who along with Manchester City and Bayern Munich are the best team in Europe right now, and we fought them on an even keel. “We are probably paying the price for the final 15 minutes of the first leg, because I think we had two very good games against an excellent opponent. “We played a great a game for 75 minutes at San Siro then conceded from a set-piece. In the first half from set-pieces they created issues, and in the second half we began to get the upper hand and scored a goal and unfortunately Sanchez got sent off. POLL “I haven’t really looked at it in any great detail so it’s difficult to comment on it “We feel upset about the fact we had a player sent off just when we were getting the upper hand in the game.”
