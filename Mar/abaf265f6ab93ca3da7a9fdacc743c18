An attack on Aramco’s petroleum products distribution plant in Jeddah caused a fire in one of the tanks but this was controlled and did not result in any casualties, Saudi state media said on Sunday, citing the Saudi-led coalition fighting Yemen’s Houthis. The coalition said that the attack by Iran-backed Houthi was confirmation of a rejection of peace efforts. (REUTERS)
