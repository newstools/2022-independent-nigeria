Concacaf today announced the dates and times for the 2022 Scotiabank Concacaf Champions League Semifinals. Sounders FC is set to face fellow MLS side NYCFC for the right to advance to the tournament championship, with the first leg of Semifinal play taking place in Seattle at Lumen Field on Wednesday, April 6 in a 7:00 p.m. PT kickoff. The away leg is being played on Wednesday, April 13 at Red Bull Arena in Harrison, New Jersey with a 6:00 p.m. PT kickoff. Single-match tickets for Seattle’s home leg of play are available to the public starting Monday, March 21 at 10:00 a.m. PT, with an exclusive pre-sale for Sounders FC Season Ticket Members starting today at 2:00 p.m. PT. With the addition of these matches to its slate, Sounders FC is rescheduling its April 9 MLS home contest vs. FC Cincinnati. The two clubs are working together to confirm an alternate date and further information is forthcoming. The Rave Green defeated Liga MX’s Club León 4-1 on aggregate in the Scotiabank Concacaf Champions League Quarterfinals, advancing to the Semifinals following a 3-0 home victory on March 8 and last night’s 1-1 result at Estadio Léon. Seattle is competing in its seventh Concacaf Champions League tournament, which crowns the best team from North America, Central America and the Caribbean. Sounders FC has advanced to at least the Quarterfinals in five of its seven appearances, with this year’s appearance in the Semifinals marking just the second time Sounders FC has advanced to the tournament’s penultimate round, having also done so in 2012-2013. The Rave Green look to defeat NYCFC on their way to the club’s first appearance in the Concacaf Champions League Final, with the winner going on to represent the confederation in the FIFA Club World Cup.
