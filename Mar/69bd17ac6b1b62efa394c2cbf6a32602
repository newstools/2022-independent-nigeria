KANO – Kano state Chapter of People’s Democratic Party was thrown into turmoil on Sunday following the formal exit of Abba Kabir Yusuf, its candidate in 2019 General elections to the New Nigeria Peoples Party, (NNPP) Kwankwasiyya faction dominated the opposition party in the state, and their exit may have reduced the political fortunes of the platform as the nation marches towards 2023 General election. Abba Kabir Yusuf, popularly known as Abba Gida-Gida lost the governorship battle to Dr. Abdullahi Umar Ganduje, the incumbent governor of the one city state in the run off three years ago. Abba Kabir Yusuf defection to the NNPP came on the heels of rumour of alleged plot by his godfather, Musa Rabiu Kwankwaso to join the party on March 30. In a brief, but elaborate ceremony at his Diso Ward in Gwale Local Government area of Kano State, Abba Gida-Gida said PDP has failed the people of Kano and its leader in the state, Rabiu Kwankwaso, despite massively voting for the party in 2019. Yusuf explained that there is no difference between his former party, and the ruling All Progressives Congress, APC. The former Commissioner for Works and infrastructure said his decision to dump the opposition party was sequel to the yearning of his teeming supporters.
