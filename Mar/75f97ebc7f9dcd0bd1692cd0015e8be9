Members of the newly in­augurated All Progressives Congress (APC) National Executive Council (NEC) have been described as ex­perienced politicians who would make the party win all elective positions in the 2023 general elections. Hon. Dada Eminence, one of the contenders for the youth leader position in the just-con­cluded APC national conven­tion, made the submission on Monday in Akure, the Ondo State capital, while commenting on the conduct and outcome of the national convention. He expressed confidence in the new leadership of the party, saying it would serve as a launch pad for the victory of the party in next year’s gener­al elections. According to Eminence, “I am a progressive and loyal par­ty member that has been toe­ing progressive party since the days of Alliance for Democra­cy (AD) in 1999 and has never defected to another party. “It is noteworthy that the personalities elected to mid­wife the affairs of our envi­able party are round pegs in round holes. “Senator Abubakar Ada­mu is a leader with sound ped­igree and other members of the National Executive Coun­cil (NEC) are highly experi­enced politicians who would rob off our party in terms of designing developmental and people-oriented programmes for party candidates to adopt.”
