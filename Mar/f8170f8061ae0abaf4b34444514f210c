Lagos – Victor Osimhen will remain at Napoli beyond the summer, with the Nigerian forward not considering moving away from the Diego Maradona just yet, says Area Napoli (as per Mario Giunta). Osimhen’s potential is often rated at par with that of PSG ace Kylian Mbappe and Borussia Dortmund’s Erling Haaland, with all three outstanding strikers expected to make big-money moves in the summer. According to reports, some of the biggest clubs on the continent are interested in Osimhen, with new moneybags Newcastle reportedly leading the race. Real Madrid also target the Nigerian as an alternative signing should they fail in their plan to land Frenchman Mbappe. Manchester United could be the club most in need of Osimhen, though, with Cristiano Ronaldo and Edison Cavani winding down the clock on their illustrious careers. But Sky Italy journalist Mario Giunta is convinced that the Super Eagles striker would not leave Napoli this summer as club owner Aurelio De Laurentiis and manager Luciano Spalletti are ‘crazy’ about the 23-year-old. The report also stated that Osimhen would not be pushing for a transfer, as he is happy in Naples. Giunta said: “There are many clubs on the Nigerian, but I feel like giving some news: Osimhen will stay in Naples again next season. “Aurelio De Laurentiis and Luciano Spalletti are crazy about him and have nointention of getting rid of him. “In addition, the former Lille man earns important figures in Campania. He is fine and doesn’t press to go away.” POLL Despite suffering a facial injury that kept him out of action for over two months, Osimhen has contributed to 17 goals (13 goals and four assists) in 24 games this season. The Nigerian international only managed 10 goals in 30 appearances in all competitions in his debut season. The former Lille forward only became a Napoli player in 2020 after signing a £74million deal, which made him the most expensive African footballer in history.
