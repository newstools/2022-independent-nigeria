Antonio Conte has told Mikel Arteta that he should think twice when complaining about Arsenal ‘s fixture schedule – after asking for the North London Derby to be postponed earlier this year. Arteta made headlines this week by labelling the Gunners’ turnaround of playing on Wednesday evening at home to Liverpool before visiting Aston Villa at lunchtime on Saturday, as “not fair” on his team. They have been handed another Wednesday-Saturday turnaround in their final 11 games of the season by the Premier League. However, January’s derby match against Tottenham has still not been rescheduled, having been called off despite the Gunners only having one confirmed case of Covid-19 in their squad. That left Spurs frustrated, something which has clearly not subsided in the two months since. Speaking on Friday, Conte said: “I only want to remember [remind] Arteta the game that we postponed – Tottenham v Arsenal, okay? Yes, if we speak about fair or unfair, okay, and, I stop. In general I think my answer is enough. “Okay? It is enough. If someone want to speak about fair or unfair. We postponed a game Tottenham v Arsenal, if you remember. I don’t forget this and I think it is not right to speak about fair or unfair.” The Italian’s response puts added pressure on the Premier League for when their two teams’ matchup is eventually rearranged in April or May. Asked in his own press conference on Friday – ahead of his side’s trip to Villa – if he was concerned about when the game will be pencilled in, Arteta admitted: “Yes. Because I don’t know and we’re not going to be deciding and it is going to be very important.” Pressed on whether or not he would raise the issue with top-flight chiefs, the Spaniard replied: “That is nothing to do with me. The club has to arrange that.”
