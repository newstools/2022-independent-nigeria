***Orders Them To Vacate Legislative Seats ABUJA – Justice Taiwo Taiwo of the Federal High Court sitting in Abuja, on Monday sacked some members of the Federal House of Representatives and the Cross River State House of Assembly who defected from the PDP to the All Progressives Congress from office. Justice Taiwo gave the order in a judgement on a suit by the Peoples Democratic Party seeking the removal of the APC House of Representatives and State House of Assembly who defected from the PDP to the APC. Delivering judgement on the originating summon marked ABJ/FHC/CS/976/21, filed in August 2021 by the PDP, the court held that “The action of the 5th to the 25th Defendants is feeble and constitutes an attempt to pull a wool in the eyes of the court. “Their counter affidavit is manifestly defective” Justice Taiwo held. Consequently, the court granted all the reliefs sought by the PDP, warning politicians to know that power belongs to the citizens.
