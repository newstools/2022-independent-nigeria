BENIN – Mrs. Maryann Shaibu, Wife of the Deputy Governor of Edo State, has called on women not to vote any member of the National Assembly (NASS) seeking re-election for rejecting bills bordering on women. Mrs Shaibu stated this while speaking at an event to mark this years International Women’s Day in Benin on Tuesday. She regretted that the NASS rejected bills that would encourage more women participation in politics. She noted that with the rejection, women progression in politics have been taking by 20 years. The wife of Edo Deputy Governor stressed that it was particularly painful when nations across the world are encouraging more women participation and making laws to encourage them. According to her, “If our senators could say no to five bills concerning women, and we are the ones voting for them, it is a shame. “I call on women not to vote for any sitting senator unless they turn around and change that bills. We will say no on election day except they do the needful. “Please don’t mind the gift they will bring to you, we must stand firm together and say no, don’t vote for them. POLL “We can’t continue to sit and watch them do what they like to us, it is not about talking, it is about action.” She also called on Edo women to set the pace in the upcoming election and prepare to run for seats in the State House of Assembly which she said is currently male dominated. She called on women groups in the State to start preparing to deploy what she described as “our best hands, and really round them for Assembly seats. “We can no longer have a male dominated house of Assembly. Let us leave petty grievances behind, let us begin to build capacity from the grassroot as larders to help each other climb to the top. “Let us stop bringing ourselves down. Let us begin to see one woman get there irrespective of her ethnicity, this way, we will not only right this wrongs but we will show to our girls that the future of their dreams is in their collective choices,” she said.
