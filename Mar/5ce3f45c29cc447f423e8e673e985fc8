WARRI – The General Overseer of God’s Delight Gospel Assembly (AKA Free Indeed), Senior Pastor John Mark Ighosotu, has ac­cused Prophet Jeremiah Omoto Fufeyin, the General Overseer of Christ Mercyland Deliver­ance Ministry, of using the po­lice and media to harass him over an issue that is currently under police investigation. Addressing journalists in Warri during the weekend, Hu­man Rights Activists, Barrister Oghenejabor Ikimi said since Prophet Fufeyin has suddenly lost confidence in the Nigeria Police and resorted “to black­mailing our client in the Press, we have decided to respond accordingly so as to keep the records straight.” Barrister Ikimi, “Our at­tention as a team of counsel to Senior Pastor John Mark Igho­sotu, the General Overseer of God’s Delight Gospel Assem­bly (AKA Free Indeed), Senior Pastor John Mark Ighosotu, has been drawn to two false online publication about our client at the behest of Prophet Jeremiah Fufeyin, the General Overseer of Christ Mercyland Deliver­ance Ministry which reads as follows: “Police detain mobile offi­cer for masterminding Delta General Overseer escape” and another which read thus: “Fufe­yin: Police inspector quizzed for alleged disappearance of Pastor Jonathan Ighosotu” “We make bold to state that the contents of the above publications consist of either outright lies and/or misrepresentation of facts capable of misleading the general public, hence this press statement,” Barrister Ikimi said.
