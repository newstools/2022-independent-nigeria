AWKA – The Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) has condemned the burning of the house of the President General of Ohanaeze Ndigbo, Professor George Obiozor’s country home, describing the act as barbaric, shameful and disgraceful to Ndigbo. In a statement signed by the media and publicity secretary of the group, Emma Powerful, it said the act must have been carried out by criminals who were against the liberation of Biafra and the release of their leader, Mazi Nnamdi Kanu. According to the statement, the arson must have been carried out “so as to create the wrong impression that Biafra agitators are violent.” It continued: “Those behind this evil act have nothing to do with IPOB, ESN or Biafra agitation. They are sponsored criminals and must be made to face the consequences of their action. “We don’t consider Professor Obiozor an enemy of IPOB and Biafra struggle. So, anybody targeting him is treading on dangerous ground. He has done nothing to deserve such a devilish and wicked attack.” The group vowed to unravel those behind the dastardly attack. It fingered criminal elements being recruited by evil politicians as behind the act and similar acts and urged them to stop. It added: “Wicked politicians must be held responsible for the ongoing destruction of Igbo land. “IPOB is ready to confront these criminals created by politicians in the name of the Ebubeagu security outfit which they intended to use to replace ESN. “Ebubeagu security outfit has turned to unknown gunmen terrorising our people. POLL They are involved in kidnappings and burning of people’s properties and houses in Imo State and other states.”
