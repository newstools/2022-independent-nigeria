Niger State Governor, Sani Bello, has said he is the acting National Chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC).There are reports that President Muhammadu Buhari has sacked the Chairman of the APC Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee, Governor Mai Mala Buni, and appointed Bello as the new chairman of the interim committee. In an interview with newsmen at the end of a meeting with the Caretaker Committee and another with states’ chairmen, Bello, who presided over the meeting, said, “The states’ chairmen took their oath of office today.”He added, “We discussed the progress made so far on convention and what needs to be done next so that we will achieve the March 26 date for the convention.” Responding to a question on why he presided over the meetings, the governor said, “Acting Chairman; I have been acting for a while since the Chairman (Buni) travelled.”When asked to confirm Buni’s sack and his appointment as the new Chairman of the Caretaker Committee, Bello said, “No comment.”Our correspondent reports that the development looks strange as Secretary of the APC Caretaker Committee, Senator John James Akpanudoedehe, is always in charge of all functions as the party’s national secretary and not the Niger State governor.‘Vice presidential ambition triggering crisis’ Confusion As Pro-Tinubu Governors Takeover APC CECPC Wike Berates APC, Says Party Adverse To Internal Democracy A member of the National Executive Committee (NEC) and former Deputy National Publicity Secretary of the ruling APC, Yekini Nabena, has asked Bello to shelve his alleged plan to summon the NEC meeting. Nabena, in a statement, said Bello’s vice-presidential ambition is triggering crisis and anarchy in the party.He argued that Bello is just a member of the APC Caretaker/Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee and does not have the legal power to singlehandedly convene NEC meetings. “Governor Bello should not destroy the ruling APC because of his personal political ambition of becoming Vice President or whatever in 2023.“The likes of Governor Bello are the political vultures working against our party and to cause anarchy in the ruling APC.“I am using this medium to call on our leaders across the states to caution Governor Sani Bello of Niger State.“The presidency should also call him to order to immediately drop the plan to convey a NEC meeting without the knowledge of Governor Mai Mala Buni and the Secretary of the CECPC. “Governor Sani Bello is neither the Chairman nor Secretary of the National Caretaker Committee. So where does he get the power to convene such meeting?” he queried.
