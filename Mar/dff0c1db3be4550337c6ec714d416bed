He called for a thorough investigation to unravel those behind the incident. Corroborating, a family source, Samuel Okoro, who is a cousin to Mrs Chigozie Onuobu, in a telephone chat with Journalists Wednesday morning alleged that the fire incident was suspicious as there was no trace of bush burning around the razed building. “I don’t think it was not deliberate. There was no trace of bush burning around the building. Moreover, they have a separate kitchen where they cook. The woman is my cousin’s sister. Actually, the man married two wives but the first wife is not living with them in the same compound. “I was told that when some people called the husband of the deceased on the development, he nearly fainted. When we asked of him, neighbours said they didn’t know his whereabouts. Maybe they felt we want to beat the man or express our anger”, Okoro said. POLL The police spokesman in the state, DSP Loveth Odah said she was in a meeting but hinted she was not aware of the incident. Odah promised to reach the Divisional Police Officer, Ikwo Police division, to get situation reports in the area.
