She was not only publicly condemned over alleged adultery, but paraded stark naked on the streets. “I must say that the conduct of the persons who took laws into their hands to debase the hapless woman was barbaric and disgusting. “How anyone could have contrived to subject a fellow human being to such debasing treatment in this 21st Century beats my imagination.
