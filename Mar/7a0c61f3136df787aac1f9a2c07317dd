The Babyn Yar Holocaust Memorial Center in Kyiv has been damaged in a Russia airstrike. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s Chief of Staff Andriy Yermak stated Tuesday. The airstrike targeted a television tower next to the center in Kyiv. Several television channels have reportedly ceased broadcasting the wake of the attack “Just now, a powerful barrage is underway. A missile hit the place where Babyn Yar memorial complex is located! Once again, these barbarians are murdering the victims of Holocaust!,” Yermak wrote on Twitter. In the massacre, the Nazis murdered nearly all the Jews in Kyiv – 33,771 people – over the course of two days. During the German occupation of Ukraine (1941 – 1943), nearly 100,000 victims were murdered and buried in Babyn Yar. While the overwhelming majority of victims were Jewish, the number also included opponents of the regime, the mentally ill, and Roma people, making Babyn Yar the largest mass grave in Europe. A special ceremony marking 80 years since the massacre was held in October. The ceremony was attended by Ukrainian President Zelenskyy, Israeli President Isaac Herzog, and German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken also addressed the event. Russian forces on Tuesday pounded Kharkiv, the second largest city in Ukraine. The government building building was struck, and the Ukrainian Health Ministry stated that ten people were killed and 35 wounded in the bombings. Despite the intensity of Russia’s attacks, no major cities have been captured since the invasion began last Thursday.
