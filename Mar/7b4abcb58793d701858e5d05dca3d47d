Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said he has signed an official application for the country to join the European Union. A senior EU official says the bloc leaders may discuss the possibility of Ukrainian membership at an informal summit this month. On Monday, Zelenskyy appealed to the EU to quickly admit Ukraine through a special procedure. But EU officials said no such fast-track procedure exists. Countries wanting to join the bloc typically face a long and complex process that takes years.
