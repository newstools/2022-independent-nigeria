ABUJA – A Kaduna bound train has been attacked by yet to be identified gunmen on Monday, forcing the stoppage of the locomotive and apprehension of over 900 passengers on board. Reports say the suspected terrorists detonated an explosive device on the rail track between Katari and Rijana stations. One of the passengers who confirmed the incident to a national daily said the attackers also surrounded the train, shooting sporadically after demobilising it. Monday’s attack is coming less than two weeks after an engagement with residents of communities along the corridor with operators of the railway, not forgetting the deployment of six surveillance vehicles on the same corridor by the federal government. The Managing Director of the Nigerian Railway Corporation (NRC), Fidet Okhiria, has confirmed the incident to television but says he is still gathering details on the incident.
