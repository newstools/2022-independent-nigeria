U.S. President Joe Biden is expected to ban imports of Russian oil to punish President Vladimir Putin for his invasion of Ukraine, the Associated Press reported Tuesday. The move comes a week after Canada enacted a similar ban and amid mounting congressional pressure on Mr. Biden to act. The President scheduled a last-minute announcement for Tuesday morning at the White House to unveil “actions to continue to hold Russia accountable.” The Associated Press, citing an unnamed source, said this would be the oil ban. Chris Coons, a Delaware senator close to Mr. Biden, said on CNN that the President had decided to enact a ban. Last year, the U.S. imported about 200,000 barrels of Russian crude oil per day, plus about 500,000 barrels of other Russian petroleum products. These accounted for a total of about 8 per cent of U.S. imports. In 2020, Russian oil made up less than 2 per cent of Canadian imports.
