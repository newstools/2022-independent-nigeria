LAGOS – Etim Esin, the former Super Eagles attacking midfielder, has charged the players of the three times African champions to up the ante and secure the 2022 FIFA World Cup ticket on Tuesday, saying the ticket is not negotiable. The former  Belgium based star player, while in a chat with our correspondent on the match on Tuesday, said missing the World Cup should not even be contemplated, asserting that every efforts should be geared towards making sure that the Black Stars were beaten to the ticket. “We are not negotiating the World Cup ticket with Ghana; we are going to have it so let the players bear this at the back of their minds. “We have done it before against them and we will still do it again. If our players have never played games of their lives, they should play it on Tuesday and make sure that we have the ticket firmly in our pocket. “Nigerians are crazy about their national team and I hope after the match, we all will be happy for it,” he said. The match starts at the MKO Abiola Stadium by 6:30 pm. The first leg ended in a barren draw and thus Ghana will be hoping to cause an upset while Nigeria will hope to seal the ticket with a win after the Super Eagles withstood fierce attack from the Black Stars in the first leg.
