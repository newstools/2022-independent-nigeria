The National President, National Council of Managing Directors of Licensed Customs Agents (NCMDLCA), Lucky Amiwero has stated that the Vehicle Identification Number (VIN) valuation introduced by Nigeria Customs Service (NSC) contravenes the Customs and Excise Management Act (CEMA) 20 of 2003, based on the transaction value method. Clearing agents and freight forwarders had protested and grounded activities in Lagos ports since last week, following the introduction of the VIN Policy. Amiwero, who was a member of the former re-constituted Presidential Task Force on the Reform of Nigeria Customs Service and member of 168 additional committees; Ministerial, inter-ministerial and nine Presidential committee of the Federal Government and the one who proposed the introduction of General Agreement on Tariff and Trade (GATT) Article VII based on Transaction value of goods, in a letter addressed to President Muhammadu Buhari, dated February 25, 2022, he said that as the Chairman sub-committee of the Reconstituted Presidential Task Force on the Reform of the NCS, on the treatment of valuation of vehicles, it was observed by the committee that the present ex-factory price is a component of Brussels Definition of Value (BDV). NPA Appeals To Maritime Workers, Customs Agents To Shelve… We’re Always At Alert, Our Officers Very Thorough – Compt Okun According to him, this is not in agreement with the provision of CEMA (amendment) 20 of 2003, which is supposed to be based on purchase price (negotiated price with a buyer and seller of motor vehicles to have transaction element). “The present ex-factory price has no negotiated component as purchase price, which is the transaction Value by importer, it lacks legal process in the criteria as contained in the treatment of Motor vehicle of Paragraph 1-6 of the Customs and excise Management (amendment) act 20 of 2003 and cannot be used but reviewed to contain features of the elements of Transaction/purchase pricing on Motor vehicles,” he said. The veteran freight forwarder stated that internet price is not a negotiated price and not admissible as transaction price or purchase price, which has no negotiating capability, as there is no buyer and seller to attract the element of transaction, which negates the doctrine of Transaction Value, and cannot be used, adding that it was clearly illegal and not acceptable as transaction value. On the World Trade Valuation Agreement, he said that the adoption of the Agreement on the implementation of Articles VII of GATT, establishes a positive system of Customs Valuation, based on price actually paid or payable for imported goods. “The valuation method provides for fair, neutral system of Valuation, conforming to commercial realities and outlaws the use of arbitrary or fictitious value method system of valuation, the Brussels Definition of Value (BDV) which is “NOTIONAL” concept that is imaginary persons or Ghost rather than the actual person involved in the import transaction, which is currently imposed by the Nigerian Custom Service (NCS), on all imported goods.” POLL The letter further explained: “The World Trade Organisation (WTO) Transaction Value of Imported Goods. “The WTO Customs Valuation Agreement (CVA) is based on a positive principle, which is opposed to a normative principle, the positive principle, Transaction Value is based on the actual price/value of the goods, rather than the “normative” principle (BDV), the Agreement’s basis of valuation is Transaction value” which is the price actually paid or payable by the buyer for the imported goods, if the sales was freely negotiated an agreement contains rules for valuation of sales.” He noted that the Customs Valuation Agreement Domesticated as Customs and Exciuse Management (Amendement) Act 20 of 2003, the GATT Article VII, Agreement on implementation of Articles VII of the general agreement of Tariff and Trade was domesticated by an Act passed by the National assembly in line with section 12 of Nigerian Constitution, as Customs and Excise Management (amendment) Act 20 of 2003, adding that the act is the only legal instruments for the treatment, procedure and the application of Value for imported goods in Nigeria. On the valuation of imported goods, Amiwero said: “The valuation of goods in Nigeria is prescribed under the Customs and Excise Management (amendment) Act 20 of 2003, which authorizes the power of treatment, process, procedures and determination of valuation of good under the Act, based on Transaction value method, with six sequential application, which states as follows: Transaction value of good general (paragraph) – 1 Transaction value of Identical goods (paragraph) – 2 Transaction Value of Similar Goods (paragraph ) – 3 NPA Moves To Revive Eastern Ports Adamawa Govt., Shippers’ Council Inaugurate Joint Committee For… Deductive/sales value of goods ( paragraph) – 4 Computed value of goods (paragraph) – 5 Reasonable means/fall back method of value (paragraph) – 6 “The determination of valuation of imported goods, is as continued in the hierarchical order of application, on the treatment of valuation of Imported goods, the law provides the primary basis for determination of the valuation of goods as Transaction value, which is defined as, the price actually paid or payable, is the total payment made or to be made by the buyer to the benefit of the seller for the imported goods, which includes all payment made as condition of sales of the imported goods by the buyer to the seller or the buyer to a third party to satisfy the obligation of the seller.” Amiwero in that letter which he also copied the Senate President, Speaker, Secretary to the Government of the Federation, Chairman, Senate Committee on Customs and Excise, the Minister of Finance and the Comptroller General of Customs. “The act clearly states, in paragraph 2 – (1) If the Customs value of identical goods already accepted under paragraph 1 of this schedule sold for export to Nigeria and exported at or about the same time, at the same commercial level and substantially the same quantity, as the goods being value, adjustment having made under paragraph 10-(1) and (2) of this schedules to take account of significant in cost and charges between the imported goods and the identical goods arising from difference in distance and mode of transport.”
