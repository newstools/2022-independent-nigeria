Guinness Nigeria Plc said it certainly has no plans to exit Nigeria, contrary to a publication making the rounds and that it is strong, stable and delivering value to their esteemed stakeholders. It added that it remained committed to delivering dividends to its shareholders who have stayed with the company for a very long time and promised not to let them down. Guinness Nigeria is reacting to a publication alleging that it is relocating out of Nigeria and therefore planning to sell its lkeja Brewery site. 2021: Dangote Cement’s Commitment To Climate Change Yields… Transcorp Hotels Profit Up 143%, Offers N0.70 Dividend “We would also like to clearly state that the malicious publication is not in tandem with our current expansion and investment drive, as we recently reaffirmed our long-term strategic expansion plans in Nigeria with the acquisition of an additional 25-acre commercial property in the Ogba industrial area of Lagos purchased recently in late 2021. “Guinness Nigeria also recently announced our Half Year Unaudited Financial Result for the six months ended 31st December 2021 in which we notified our esteemed shareholders of our stellar performance in which our six months’ operating profit grew by 266 per cent to N13.6 billion. “Contrary to the false information being circulated by detractors, we are renewed in our efforts to serve our revered consumers and creating more job opportunities for Nigerians as seen in the new $5million additional production line recently commissioned at our Brewery in Ogba, Lagos in October 2021. “We are also pleased to state that we are on the verge of completing work on our new ultra-modern head office block located in lkeja where we will be moving in the next few weeks. “We urge our employees, stakeholders, and members of the public to ignore the false, malicious, and misleading publication as it never emanated from the Management of Guinness Nigeria Plc.”, a statement by the company said.
