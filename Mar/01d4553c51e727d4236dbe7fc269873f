In life, there is no big deal in dreaming big and no one can stop a dreamer from dreaming to the highest skies. Though dreams are never meant to be in the sleep but should be accentuated and worked on when one wakes up, especially when it is a big dream. One person whose dreams seem to be coming true in the face of stiff criticism, mere mental fabrication, speculations, and fullness of time is the boardroom guru and quintessential corporate and economist, Godwin Emefiele. The incumbent Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Emefiele has been touted in many creditable quarters as a very good material for the number one seat of the Federal Republic of Nigeria in Aso Rock but even with the speculations and rumours surrounding this presidential bid, Emefiele remains undaunted, leaving the spur of the moment to dictate the political pace. Even as a qualified and credible candidate to occupy the seat as a public servant of the people without fear or favour with his inimitable records and sterling achievements to show for it, while he has not officially declared his intentions for the 2023 presidential race, various groups have been clamouring and mounting their support for the Delta State-born banker to contest for Nigeria’s highest public office. But if Emefiele considers what many presumed as a big dream and is ready to take over the driver’s seat of the country and accept to lead the charge in 2023 as being widely clamoured and canvassed by Nigerians from all over the world, as he had done in the last eight years to strengthen and stabilising the economy through his headship of the CBN. Give or take, the apex bank chief, Godwin Emefiele has all it takes to take on the battle for the presidency when the whistle blows.
