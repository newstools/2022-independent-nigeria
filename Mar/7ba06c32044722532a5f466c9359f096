KADUNA – Governor Aminu Waziri Tambuwal of Sokoto State has stormed Kaduna to solicit for the support of the party stakeholders ahead of the 2023 election. Tambuwal in the company of other party stalwarts stated that the opposition party was ready to take over power from the All Progressives Congress (APC). The presidential hopeful, who lamented what he described as a near collapse of governance at the centre, urged Nigerians to kick out APC in order to save the country from a total collapse. The former House of Representatives speaker lamented the state of the country and knocked APC for failing to redeem its campaign promises. He recalled with nostalgia how well governed the country was under PDP, adding that Nigerians were deceived and cajoled by the current ruling party, which he noted promised the electorate heaven on earth with nothing to show after seven years in power other than a barrage of problems. Tambuwal noted that the country had been put on autopilot with no defined policy direction other than foistering havoc and hardship on Nigerians. In his speech, the former governor of Sokoto State, Attahiru Bafarawa, urged party members and supporters to rally round Tambuwal to be the next President of Nigeria. Bafarawa recounted advantages of Tambuwal to include young age, economic and political knowledge of how best to develop the country, an attributes he said were absent in the present occupant of Aso Rock. Kaduna State PDP chairman, Felix Hassan Hyat, while lending his voice to the call to allow Northwest produce the next president of Nigeria , added that the zone was shortchanged with the death of former President Yar ‘adua to complete her term under the rotation and zoning arrangements. POLL He, however, sounded a caveat that he was not campaigning for Tambuwal, that as leader of the party in Kaduna he would play a dispassionate and fatherly role to all aspirants seeking one elective position or the other.
