He is our member in the profession too. We are happy that one of us has been appointed to this position. We have come to say thank you to the University and pledge our support to the Management ’’. The Vice-Chancellor in his response also thanked the Council for the visit, and hoped that the visit would mark the beginning of greater collaboration between the University and the Council. He hinted at the infrastructural developments in the University under his watch, some of which include New bakery, New bottling machine for the water factory, Welcome centre, Twin Duplex for Principal Officers, new laboratories and others. He said the physical development effort materialized because funds of the University are carefully and prudently managed.‘We do not use contractors here. We do direct labour. POLL When I told members of the Governing Council of the University how much it cost us to build the twin duplexes, they were surprised that we could achieve such with minimal funds. “I hope that when you come for our next convocation you will see new things’ Professor Adebayo said. The Vice- Chancellor did not mince words on the need for the government to allow private Universities access Tertiary Education Trust Fund (TETFUND), stating that they were rendering a vital service to the society, given the fact that the money is collected from the public which is why they should be meant to have access to it. He solicited the advocacy of the media on the matter, stating that the private Universities would achieve a lot if they benefit from the TETFUND. In his vote of thanks, the DVC, Professor Muyiwa Poppola, expressed gratitude to the Vice- Chancellor for finding him worthy of serving the University in that capacity. He said he could not have emerged as the Deputy Vice-Chancellor if the VC did not want to work with him. He promised to do his best in supporting the Vice- Chancellor to take the University to greater heights.
