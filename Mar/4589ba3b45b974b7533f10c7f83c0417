Defender Ben Davies will miss Wales’ friendly against Czech Republic on Tuesday in Cardiff. The 28-year-old has left Robert Page’s squad and returned to Tottenham Hotspur. The Football Association of Wales (FAW) has given no reason for Davies’ departure following the World Cup play-off semi-final win over Austria. He played the full 90 minutes of that 2-1 win on Thursday. The FAW has already announced funds from the game against the Czechs will go towards the Disasters Emergency Committee (DEC) Ukraine Humanitarian Appeal. Because of Russia’s invasion, Ukraine’s semi-final play-off against Scotland has been postponed until June. Wales will meet the winner of that encounter, with a place at the 2022 Qatar World Cup at stake.
