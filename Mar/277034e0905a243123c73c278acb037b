Middlesbrough boss Chris Wilder has lauded Manchester United-linked Thomas Tuchel for bringing “stability” to Chelsea. The Championship side stunned United in the FA Cup fourth round as they dumped their hosts out of the competition at Old Trafford on penalties. Tuchel has been linked with the soon-to-be-vacant managerial role at United as Chelsea continue to be rocked by the sanctions placed upon owner Roman Abramovich. Ralf Rangnick was announced as the interim head coach following Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s sacking. Despite the change of tacticians, problems at the club have remained, with Erik ten Hag recently emerging as the preferred managerial candidate. “We played a full-hit Man United, a full-hit Tottenham and a full-hit Chelsea,” Wilder said at full-time as his side were beaten by Chelsea in the FA Cup quarter-final. “We hung in there with United and beat them on penalties. We fully deserved it versus Tottenham and we couldn’t find the right defensive moments tonight. “Chelsea just find a way. It is the mentality of the group led by an incredible manager. They have stability with Thomas coming in and the other two clubs maybe don’t have that. “Their skipper [Cesar Azpilicueta], Thiago [Silva] and [Antonio] Rudiger just want to win and that’s why they win things and are champions,” he added.
