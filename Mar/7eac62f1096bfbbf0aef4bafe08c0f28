Chelsea have withdrawn their request to have their FA Cup quarter-final at Middlesbrough played behind closed doors. The Blues announced earlier today – to much derision – that they had asked for Saturday’s game at the Riverside Stadium to take place without supporters “for matters of sporting integrity”. That decision was taken after Chelsea were unable to sell tickets for the game following discussions with the Office of Financial Sanctions Implementation, which did not make “appropriate amendments” to the Government licence granted to the club after owner Roman Abramovich was sanctioned last week.
