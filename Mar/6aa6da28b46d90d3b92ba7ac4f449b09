Lagos – The House of Representatives’ recent rejection of a Bill seeking to reserve special seats for women at the National and State Houses of Assembly has been described as a stark reminiscence of enduring biases against women in politics. Abigail Ogwezzy-Ndisika, Professor of Mass Communication at the University of Lagos, stated this while presenting a paper titled: ‘Women’s Participation in the Electoral Process: Some Reflections,’ at a Media Stake-holders’ Meeting and Public Presentation of Publications by the Institute For Media and Society (IMS) under the Support to Media (Component 4A) of the European Union Support to Democratic Governance in Nigeria (EU-SDGN) Project. She said out of the 302 lawmakers present at the session, only 81 voted in favour of parliamentary seats for women that similarly, the male-dominated House also expressly threw away another Bill seeking to provide for affirmative action for women in political party administration. Ogwezzy-Ndisika noted that although women participate in politics as voters, candidates, politicians, civil society activists and that women and men tend to be treated very differently in the political arena. She said Civil Society Organisations, community and religious leaders, and the private sector in collaboration with international development agencies should rise up to the occasion and to accelerate gender balance in politics. She said Nigerian women constituted about half the population and should be politically aware to convert this strength to power. ”Women should continue to engage the government using moral suasion, advocacy, bargaining and negotiation for power to pursue internal party democracy that will entrench affirmative action in party constitutions.”
