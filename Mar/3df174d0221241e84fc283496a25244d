The European Commission has proposed to grant temporary protection to people fleeing Ukraine, it said on Wednesday. It also said that it would grant a residence permit, access to employment and social welfare. “More than 500,000 refugees have now fled from Ukraine into neighbouring countries,” UN refugee chief Filippo Grandi said in a tweet. The legislation, designed to deal with mass arrivals of dislocated people in the EU, will provide protection in all EU states. The proposal will be discussed by EU interior ministers on Thursday. 1800 people from Ukraine have arrived in Germany so far and hundreds arrived by train in Poland, DW reported. “It is our duty to take in those who flee war,” French Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin told France 2 TV on February 28.
