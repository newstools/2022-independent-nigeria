P/HARCOURT – Senator Magnus Abe has given explanation to why he cannot sue the Rivers State Governor, Nyesom Wike, who alleged that the former secretary to state government embezzled N4 billion meant for road construction of road projects in the Ogoni area of the state. Abe, who represented Rivers South East Senatorial District from 2011 to 2015, explained that Wike’s allegations were part of a political campaign, adding that he had long cleared the air and proven his innocence and even made peace with Wike to engender development and growth of the state. It would be recalled that in September 2016 during the groundbreaking ceremony of the construction of a road project in Bodo City, Gokana LGA of Rivers state, Wike accused Abe of abandoning the Kpobie-Bodo road project after collecting over N4bn to complete the project. Responding to questions from one of young professionals in an interactive session in Port Harcourt, the state capital, Abe explained that a sustained tearing down of political contemporaries and enemies over politics would only hamper the growth of the state. “Nyesom Wike is my friend. That time that he made that video we were campaigning, he went to Gokana to campaign for his party and he made those accusations there. I went to Ikwerre to go and reply to him and we attacked ourselves. “We don’t go to court over such things, when we finished that election, during the thanksgiving service, I invited him, he came and he said that he fought me, we have forgotten about that and that is now in the past.
