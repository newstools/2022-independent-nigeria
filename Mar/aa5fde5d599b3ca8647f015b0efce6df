ABAKALIKI – The All Progressives Congress (APC) in Ebonyi State has rejected the Tuesday judgement of the Federal High Court Abuja which removed Governor David Umahi and his deputy, Dr. Kelechi Igwe, from their offices, over their defection from the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) to the All Progressives Congress (APC). The Party made its position known through its Chairman, Mr Stanley Okoro-Emegha. Emegha noted that the presiding judge erred in his judgement and described it as an abuse of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria 1999 as amended.

The APC boss accused Justice Ekwo Inyang of acting the script of political detractors which was orchestrated to embarrass the Governor and his Deputy in order to achieve cheap political points. “The judgement was clearly biased and it’s unacceptable. Already there is a judgement from a High Court in Abakaliki and also in Zamfara state which said that a Governor and his Deputy can not be removed from office on account of their defection to another party. “However, there is no need for panic as the judgement will surely be appealed. All members of the APC and supporters of the Governor are advised to remain calm and law-abiding”, he said.
