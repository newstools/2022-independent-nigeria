The People’s Democratic Party (PDP) stalwart and former commissioner in the immediate past PDP administration, Babagoro Abdulkadir Yahaya, has dumped his former party for the ruling All Progressives Party (APC). The renowned grassroots politician in a statement made available to newsmen in Gombe State said he is joining forces with Governor Inuwa Yahaya because the PDP lacks a pragmatic manifesto and focus as such, is doomed for failure. He said he took the bold step to renounce his membership of the PDP to join the ruling APC in the State because it has been making waves and gaining new grounds to the detriment of what he described as the “increasingly sinking PDP whose dwindling fortunes are becoming glaring with each day’s passage”. According to him, Governor Inuwa Yahaya’s tenure in office has heralded a positive turn of events as well as unprecedented strides in various sectors adding that the road networks dotting the state as well as electricity, pipe-borne water and other infrastructural and basic amenities put in place by the people friendly Governor is enough to attract any patriotic Gombe citizen to join the APC. He said, now that he has crossed over to a Safe Haven and a suitable platform, it gives him an impetus to join in repositioning the State to make it a beacon of hope and envy of other people. The new APC chieftain noted with delight that even outside the corridors of power, Alhaji Inuwa Yahaya was able to win the heart of the majority of Gombe people adding that nothing stops his reelection bid considering the incumbency factor and popular support he is still enjoying. He is therefore calling on the people of Gombe State to massively support the State’s helmsman towards making the State the eighth wonder of the world.
