Nigeria Super Eagles were lucky to escape unscathed in their 2022 FIFA World Cup playoffs against Ghana Black Stars in Kumasi on Friday as they held their host to a goalless game. The first leg result means that the Super Eagles must win the second leg on Tuesday in Abuja for them to qualify for the World Cup in Qatar in November. The Super Eagles that came out yesterday were like the Su­per Eagles under sacked Gernot Rohr. Unimpressive, unable to string passes together. The mid­field was overwhelmed by the Ghanaian giving the defence much work to do. With Black Stars clipping their wings, the team could not break down the Ghanaian de­fence. But the story was different in Egypt as Senegalese Saliou Ciss fourth minute own goal was what Egypt needed to win the first leg 1-0. Efforts by Sene­gal to eqaulise failed as the Pha­raohs held on tightly. Algeria inflicted a rare home defeat on Cameroon as the Des­ert Foxes took a crucial 1-0 lead from the first leg. Playing in Douala, where Cameroon have been unbeaten since losing a Nations Cup qualifier in 2000, veteran Islam Slimani’s winner handed Algeria coach Djamel Belmadi the perfect 46th birth­day present. Five minutes before the break, the former Leicester City striker rose to meet Youcef Belaili’s free kick and power a header past Ajax goalkeeper Andrè Onana. The Desert Foxes – bidding to reach a fifth World Cup – host Cameroon, who have been to more World Cups (seven) than any other African side, in the return leg on Tuesday. But Morocco scored a crucial away goal in the 75th minute to earn a 1-1 draw away in DR Congo. Yoane Wissa gave the hosts the lead in the 11th min­ute thanks to a deflection off the head of Morocco captain Romain Saiss. POLL In the second-half Morocco’s Ryan Mmae then put the ball over the bar from the penalty, before Tarik Tissoudali grabbed the equaliser. DR Congo finished the game with 10 men after Glody Ngon­da was dismissed for a second yellow card.
