Paris Saint Germain are interested in re-signing former academy graduate Christopher Nkunku from RB Leipzig as a part of a summer rebuild, 90min understands. The Parisians are working hard on a number of summer targets and Nkunku, who came through the youth ranks and played close to 80 games for PSG before leaving in 2019, is one of a number of players they have their eye on. Leipzig paid just £10m to land Nkunku, but his progress has been outstanding at both domestic and European level and he is now widely recognised as one of Europe’s top young attacking midfielders. A host of clubs are tracking Nkunku, who has recently been called up to the France squad by Didier Deschamps, but PSG are set to make a concerted effort to bring him back to the Parc des Princes as they look to reshape their squad. The club’s supporters have shown their displeasure with performances at various points of the season – despite being on course to reclaim the Ligue 1 title – with the likes of Neymar and Lionel Messi openly booed. A summer of upheaval is expected in the French capital as a result, with manager Mauricio Pochettino likely to head for the exit door after failing to progress the club beyond the last 16 of the Champions League – a move that could lead to the appointment of Zinedine Zidane. With Kylian Mbappe also on his way out, PSG are keen to get their recruitment drive right this summer and are confident of bringing Nkunku, who they see as a key part of their anticipated rebuild, back to the club despite mounting interest elsewhere. Indeed, a source close to the situation told 90min: “PSG realise a mistake was made when Nkunku left, but would he have been able to progress as he has? Probably not, but now he is set to be offered the chance to return and both player and club believe there is ‘unfinished business’ in Paris.”
