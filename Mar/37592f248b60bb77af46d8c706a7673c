Russia has destroyed about 4,500 residential buildings, 100 enterprises, 400 educational institutions and 150 medical establishments in Ukraine, a Ukrainian government minister says. The total damage across the country will be assessed after the end of hostilities and removal of mines, Minister for Community and Territorial Development Oleksiy Chernyshov says, as quoted by the Interfax-Ukraine news agency. According to preliminary assessments, the losses incurred by Ukraine have reached tens of billions of US dollars, with the sum increasing daily. With a view to reconstruction efforts, the government has simplified procedures for construction material imports. However, the minister adds, any reconstruction must be preceded by clearing mines and rubble. Ukraine hopes to involve domestic and foreign specialists in reconstruction efforts.
