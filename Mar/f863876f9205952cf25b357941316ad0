In the early morning of today, between 6:30 am to 7 am, there was a tanker that was parked by the roadside and the vehicle lost control and hit the tanker and later went into flame.’’ Agure advised motorists to avoid night journeys saying, “God who created us knows why he created day and night. “The vehicle was coming from Lagos in the night. Because for you to be around Jamata Bridge, Akpayan Road at that early hours means you drove throughout the night,” he added. He however admonished the drivers to avoid stressing themselves by driving at night to avoid accidents on our roads.
