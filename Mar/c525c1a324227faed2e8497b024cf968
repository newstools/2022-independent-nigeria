Liverpool are eyeing Porto superstar Otavio after their success with signing Luis Diaz from the Portuguese side. Colombian international Diaz was signed by the Reds from Porto and has made an instant impact at Anfield since January. He has already made a convincing claim to becoming a regular starter alongside Sadio Mane and Mohamed Salah, despite facing tough competition from Diogo Jota and Roberto Firmino. The 25-year-old winger has scored twice in 12 appearances, but it is his game-changing attributes that has impressed Liverpool the most. And Jurgen Klopp has been so encouraged with his displays that the club is now looking to raid Porto again in the summer. Porto attacking-midfielder and Diaz’s former teammate Otavio has reportedly caught the interest of Klopp and Reds bosses. Portuguese outlet A Bola claim there is a chance the 27-year-old could join the 2020 Premier League champions at the end of this season. The Reds reportedly eyed Otavio last summer but did not end up signing an immediate replacement for the departing Georginio Wijnaldum. Instead, Klopp looked to youngsters Harvey Elliott and Curtis Jones to add depth to the midfield. However, the Reds are expected to make a move for a more established player in their engine room this year, with James Milner and Jordan Henderson now both in their thirties. Otavio has starred for Porto this season, scoring three goals and notching 11 assists in 25 league matches. Liverpool, who are gaining on Premier League leaders Manchester City and could win the quadruple this season, are said to face competition from Newcastle for the midfielder. The Brazilian-born Portuguese international has a release clause of around £50.2million and could become one of Liverpool’s most expensive signings ever if they manage to beat the Magpies to his signature. The club has only ever spent above £50million on three players in the past – Virgil van Dijk, Alisson and Naby Keita – and they will no doubt seek to negotiate a lower fee.
