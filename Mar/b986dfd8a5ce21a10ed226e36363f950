IBADAN – The Oyo State Government on Tuesday ordered the immediate closure of Oke- Ogun College of Management Sciences and Technology, Iseyin. The Commissioner for Education, Science and Technology, Rahman Abiodun Abdu-Raheem, said the institution was shut down for non-compliance with registration procedures. Recall that some indigenes of the town, under the auspices of ‘Ebedi Frontliner’, had petitioned the Oyo State government; the Minister of Education, and the National Board for Technical Education asserting that the institution was neither registered nor accredited for students’ enrolment among other allegations.

He said this would avoid unnecessary embarrassment for both the state and the proprietors. Abdu-Raheem had last month directed the proprietor of the college, Mr. Adewale Owoseni, to remove all billboards with the inscriptions of the school until the needful was done. The Commissioner affirmed the state government’s commitment to ensure due process was followed in all affairs of the state.
