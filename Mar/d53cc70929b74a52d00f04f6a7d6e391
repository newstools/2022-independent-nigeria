According to Kolawole Osinowo, CEO of Baobab+ Nigeria, the company is in Nigeria to help close the huge energy access deficit.

This represents 43% percent of the country’s population and makes Nigeria the country with the largest energy access deficit in the world. “This week, Baobab+ has launched our Solar Pay-as-you-go home systems in Alimosho Local government in Lagos and Sango-Ota in Ogun State. In the coming months, it will expand its reach across Nigeria to support the government’s effort in off-grid solar distribution. “I am very happy that Baobab+ is taking this next step, made possible by the incredible work done by our team. We started operations in 2021 with a deep focus on providing top-quality solar products leveraging the Baobab Group Microfinance channel, and now we are set to expand the opportunities with affordable access to these products through our Pay-As-You-Go financing option,” said Osinow.
