ABAKALIKI  – A governorship aspirant on the platform of the All Pro­gressives Congress (APC) in Ebonyi State, Dr. Elias Nnan­na Igwe, has congratulated members of the party across the country and beyond on the successful national con­vention held last Saturday. Igwe also congratulated the newly elected national and zonal working commit­tees of the party that emerged at the convention. A statement he personally signed on Monday lauded the leaders of the APC over what he described as a show of maturity, cooperation, unity, love and patriotism witnessed among them, in the handling of the processes that led to the emergence of the officers through consensus. He further commended President Muhammadu Bu­hari for what he termed his outstanding fatherly role, which he said, immensely led to the success of the conven­tion; even as he noted that the success of the convention was a clear demonstration that the ruling APC was focused on achieving a better Nigeria.
