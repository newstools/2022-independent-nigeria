. As Electorate Commend INEC For Good Work So Far Some four hours into the Osun State gubernatorial election, officials of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) have expressed satisfaction with the high turnout of voters at their respective polling units of the ongoing keenly contested election. Reports monitored via the TVC News live coverage reveal that despite the prompt arrival of the electoral (INEC) officials, the eager electorate had already taken positions in the queue to get accredited for the ultimate casting of their ballots. It is also interesting to note that even the general voters’ opinions sampled are impressively positive to the nation’s electoral umpire for the high level of preparedness displayed by its operatives in their conduct and supervision of the Osun polls so far. The development has raised the hope that future elections in the country will continue to improve in the area of INEC’s tidy preparation, voter participation, voter decorum and security consciousness. All things being equal, in about one from now, voting should officially come to an end but INEC officials have assured that whoever is found already in the queue to vote by that ultimatum would definitely be allowed to cast their ballots.
