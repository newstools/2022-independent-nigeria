Rather than becoming part of the problems,we have resolved to always endeavour to be part of the solutions to the various maladies in our industry. “As law-abiding citizens, we humbly suggest the following as solutions to tackling the challenges of the industry. “It is our opinion that the monopoly of Truck Transit Park (TTP) to ETO be broken, solely by unbundling the system. As far as we are concerned, COMTUA believes competition would usher in great improvements that could bring the much needed respite for the sector, even now that it is obvious that the present situation on ground has not brought the expected dividends. “As an association, which is poised to seek proper solution to the problem we have insisted on the creation of a dedicated enforcement team that will regulate the activities of the sector.The enforcement team will also have members of our trucking community as stakeholders. “This will enhance our operation and also help the revitalization of the Presidential task team, where the relevant stakeholders including our trucking unions and association are members. “The support for our union in the implementation of our local call-up arrangement that was done in partnership with relevant agencies viś-à-viś the Nigerian Port Authority, the Nigerian Shippers’ Council and the Ministry of Transportation. “We have also keyed into the new measure by unbundling the current exorbitant ETO system by seeking a forensic audit of the ETO’s past activities since there are several alleged irregularities. “COMTUA also seeks refund of all monies, illegally collected by ETO and the payment of amounts due to all parties in the ETO arrangement,even as it urged the Federal Government to improve on its activities relating to the regulations of traffic movements within the federal roads leading to the ports. While seeking the best solution, Aroyewun stated also that with the new transformational agenda embarked upon by the minister of state for Transport, the national leadership of COMTUA has unanimously recommended the Minister of State, Gbemisola Saraki to become a substantive minister to the president. The association also urged the federal government to look into the activities and qualifications of the terminal operators,shipping lines and other agencies with stakes in the industry for proper monitoring as well as keeping them alive to their duties. “We have made deliberate efforts to carry all members of our trucking community along in policy making and formulations in the sector by the relevant agencies of the government. Responding,Vice President Yemi Osinbajo, expressed appreciation to the leadership of the association for seeking proper measure to address the problems of the sector, saying the greatest concern of the federal government is to enhance the process of doing business in the maritime industry.
