Southampton are in negotiations to sign Rangers midfielder Joe Aribo, The Athletic understands. The versatile 25-year-old is believed to be keen on joining Ralf Hassenhuttl’s side and the clubs are now working to agree a fee. Aribo’s contract has always included a £10 million release clause and it is understood that Rangers will not accept a total package below that value. Although one other club are talking to the Scottish team, Southampton are confident of securing the Nigeria international and a deal spanning at least four years is being prepared. The proposed transfer would also be subject to Aribo undergoing a medical before it is completed. Aribo is known to have thoroughly enjoyed his time at Rangers and while his preference is a move south of the border and to play Premier League football, he wants the situation to be dealt with amicably. The former Charlton Athletic player was scheduled to meet up with the rest of the Rangers squad in Portugal on Thursday but he is currently in London. He joined Rangers in 2019, signing a four-year contract with the Ibrox club. He was a near ever-present last season under Steven Gerrard and Giovanni van Bronckhorst, making 57 appearances in all competitions, scoring nine goals and assisting a further 10. -Advertisement- POLL Nominally a central or attacking midfielder, Aribo was occasionally deployed as a striker by Van Bronckhorst amid an injury crisis during the second half of the 2021-22 campaign. Southampton have already made three summer signings, bringing in goalkeepers Gavin Bazunu and Mateusz Lis and defender Armel Bella-Kotchap. The Athletic has also reported that Ralph Hasenhuttl’s side are close to completing a deal for City midfielder Romeo Lavia.
