Paulo Dybala reportedly spoke to Roma coach Jose Mourinho today, but despite them offering the best contract, he is still waiting on Napoli and above all Inter. La Joya is a free agent after Juventus withdrew their contract extension and allowed his deal to run down on June 30. He had seemed to be on the verge of signing for the Nerazzurri, but they hit the brakes when securing Romelu Lukaku on loan from Chelsea, as they need to clear out Alexis Sanchez before bringing anyone else in. This has given Roma and Napoli the opportunity to break in with their own proposals and several sources maintain the Giallorossi have made the highest wage proposal of any of the candidates. La Stampa also suggest that Mourinho spoke directly to Dybala by phone today to convince the Argentina international to choose the Stadio Olimpico. However, they are not in the Champions League, so Dybala is still expected to wait for Napoli and above all Inter to make counter-offers.
