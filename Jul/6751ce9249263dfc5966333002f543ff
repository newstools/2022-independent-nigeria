The Anambra State governor, Prof. Chukwuma Soludo, has explained why government de­molished the Mountain of Holy Ghost Intervention and Deliver­ance Ministry owned by contro­versial Prophet Chukwuemeka Ohanaemere alias ‘Odumeje’ in the commercial city of Onitsha. Governor Soludo in a state­ment by his Chief Press Secre­tary, Christian Aburime, said the cleric failed to comply with gov­ernment’s directive to remove illegal structure he built on the waterway. Odumeje’s church in March this year was identified by the government as one of the build­ings sitting on drainage chan­nels, and marked for demolition, in line with Onitsha Urban Re­newal Plan spearheaded by Solu­do-led administration. The statement reads, “Follow­ing the expiration of the more than two weeks’ notice beginning from April 2022 served on devel­opers and building owners who built several illegal structures along the waterway in Fegge and environs within Onitsha, Anam­bra State government has begun demolition of such structures.
