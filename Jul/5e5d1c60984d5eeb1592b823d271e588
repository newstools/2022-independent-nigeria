Gunmen invaded the house of one Reverend Daniel Umaru of the EYN Church, Njairi, in the Mubi Local Government Area of Adamawa State, killed his sons, and abducted his 13-year-old daughter. According to PUNCH Metro, Umaru, who survived the attack, was in critical condition in a hospital. The gunmen, who reportedly stormed the family’s house around 2 am, shot the cleric and his two sons, who died instantly. The attack was said to have left his wife, who thought her husband was also dead, in a coma, as the hoodlums made away with their only daughter. The state Police Public Relations Officer, SP Suleiman Nguroje, who confirmed the attack, said the state police commissioner had deployed personnel to rescue the abducted daughter. He noted that the command had also made available a huge financial reward for anyone with information that could lead to the arrest of the culprits. The state Governor, Ahmadu Fintiri, in a press release by his Chief Press Secretary, Humwashi Wonosikou, described the attack as shocking and barbaric. He said, “The state government condemns in strongest terms the despicable attack on this innocent family; the perpetrators of this heinous act must be brought to justice, and we have offered our full support to security agencies to do so.”
