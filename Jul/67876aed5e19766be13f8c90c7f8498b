Amid widespread debates over the religious backgrounds of presidential candidates and their running mates, the presidential candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Asiwaju Bola Tinubu has settled for a Muslim running mate, NAN reports. According to a source in the Tinubu Campaign Organisation, who requested anonymity, the former Lagos State Governor would make the name of the candidate public this week. The vice-presidential nominee may most likely be a former governor and senator from the Northeast part of Nigeria. The source said, “The person is also by accident of birth a Muslim, confirming what Gov. Abdullahi Ganduje of Kano State said on Saturday that Tinubu had settled for a Muslim-Muslim ticket. “The considerations given for the choice of a running mate were dictated by the need to choose an individual capable of working with the presidential candidate to take Nigeria to greater heights,” the source added.
