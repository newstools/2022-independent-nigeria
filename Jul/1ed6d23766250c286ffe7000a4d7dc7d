Arsenal are close to reaching an agreement with Manchester City to sign Oleksandr Zinchenko, talkSPORT understands. The Gunners believe Zinchenko’s relationship with manager Mikel Arteta gives them their edge over the £35m rated Ukrainian’s other suitors. The north London side are keen to strengthen their defensive options this summer with the signing of a left-back among the top priorities. That comes following the patchy run of injuries suffered by Kieran Tierney over the last 12 months. Zinchenko will also offer crucial versatility to Arteta’s squad, with the player capable of playing in both central midfield and on the left wing. The 25-year-old has been a valuable squad player under Pep Guardiola, but has seen starts limited due to competition for places. As a result he made just 28 appearances in all competitions last term, leading City being open to offers. Arsenal have already completed a deal to sign Gabriel Jesus from Man City earlier this summer, with Zinchenko possibly in line to join him.
