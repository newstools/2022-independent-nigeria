The co-convener of the BringBackOurGirls movement Aisha Yesufu has called on Nigerians to raise funds for the campaign of the presidential candidate of the Labour Party, Peter Obi. Yesufu in a series of tweets noted that the presidential campaign is expensive and Obi does not have money to depend on for his campaign adding that he should open a Gofundme account with stringent measures to ensure accountability and transparency. She tweeted, “Presidential campaign is EXPENSIVE! It needs billions! Can we raise 100 billion? “Can Peter Obi @PeterObi set up an account, Gofundme, mobile payment for donations to start? There must be stringent measures to ensure accountability and transparency. “The biggest factor the average politician has is either money or access to money. I believe with Peter Obi the people have to contribute that money. There is no State money that Peter Obi will be dependent on or even state machinery. “There is no time. Plans should be in high gear now. Other candidates have the luxury of time. Peter Obi doesn’t and so things should be in high motion. People are ready to donate. “Peter Obi @PeterObi should have his financial team set up the necessary accounts, Gofundme, and mobile payment system and launch the campaign fundraising. Not one that different groups of people will be setting up. “This election is now glaringly one of survival for many Nigerians and we must put our monies where our votes are. We will have to be the ones donating to our candidates. The people must be the power brokers! POLL “A 100 billion is doable. Our little money when added together by many of us will lead to that sum. Let us not be afraid.”
