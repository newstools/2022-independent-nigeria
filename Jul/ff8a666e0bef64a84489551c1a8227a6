Senator Abdullahi Adamu, National Chairman of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) on Tuesday blamed the last Saturday’s Osun State Governorship election’s defeat on an internal crisis rocking the party at the state level. The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) governorship candidate, Ademola Adeleke, won the election after polling 403,371 votes to defeat the incumbent governor, Gboyega Oyetola,  who scored 375,927 votes in the election held across the 30 local government areas of the state. Adamu who spoke in an interview with BBC Hausa said that the crisis within Osun APC stakeholders led to the loss in the poll. Speaking further, the former Nasarawa State Governor stressed that the party had accepted the defeat in good faith and had learned valuable lessons from it. However, he expressed confidence that the APC would win the forthcoming general elections while calling on the opposition People’s Democratic Party (PDP) to wait for the outcome of the general elections. He said, “We lost the race not because we are incapable but because the crisis caused it. We had a colossal gathering of supporters a few days before the election in Osogbo. One can never anticipate we would lose the election. “But it’s the tradition of life to lose something that you dearly need. We conceded the defeat in good faith and we take lessons from it. “Osun’s defeat doesn’t in any way signal our loss in the general elections. We only lost one state out of the 22 we have; you see, we are still strong. POLL “We will seat and scrutinise ourselves. We must ask ourselves what is right and wrong and what needs corrections,” he said.
