Manchester United have agreed personal terms with Feyenoord left-back Tyrell Malacia as the Dutch international looks set to join the Premier League club. Man United will pay an initial €15m to Feyenoord with €2m add-ons attached to the deal reports Fabrizio Romano and the hijacking of Lyon’s transfer looks like it has been accomplished. It was reported last week by the Daily Mail that Lyon submitted a £12million bid for Malacia and Fabrizio Romano confirmed that a deal for the left-back had been agreed and all that was left to do was sort out the final details before the transfer could become official. However, Man United got involved this week and turned Malacia’s head.
