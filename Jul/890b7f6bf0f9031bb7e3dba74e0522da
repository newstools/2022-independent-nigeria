The presidential candidate of the Labour Party (LP) and former Governor of Anambra State, Peter Obi on Tuesday paid a visit to Pastor David Oyedepo, the founder of the Living Faith Church Worldwide, popularly known as Winners Chapel at the Canaan Land in Ota, Ogun State. Daily Independent gathered that one of the church’s pastors known as Leke Beecroft shared the photo of him and Bishop Oyedepo on his official Facebook page on Wednesday. Peter Obi’s visit to the renowned cleric may not be unconnected to his presidential bid in the 2023 general elections as the details of the visit are yet to be known. Although, there are speculations that the visit was for ‘priestly and birthday blessings’, according to the church gist. It could be recalled that Oyedepo has been a strong critic of the ruling All Progressive Congress (APC) government led by  President Muhammadu Buhari. He had also described the current administration as being corrupt and wicked.
