Chelsea are monitoring a move for Barcelona midfielder Frenkie de Jong this summer, according to reports. It comes amid heavy interest from Premier League rivals Manchester United. The Netherlands international may be able to add much-needed depth and long-term security to the middle third for Thomas Tuchel. The German coach has already faced the reality of losing two first-team midfielders and could see something similar next summer. That’s because both Jorginho and N’Golo Kante enter their final 12-months under contract with the Blues. Discussing their future, the manager said: “Nobody wants that with big players and important players nowadays. It’s a wish as a coach that we solve this in the summer in any way, that we solve it and it’s clear where the journey is and what the decision is. Yes, this is the wish.” It remains to be seen whether either player will continue beyond the next campaign at Stamford Bridge, however, there may be a desire to consolidate that area of the pitch in the eventuality that they leave or they are injured. While West Ham’s Declan Rice has been a long-term target for that role, the Hammers’ stance on the midfielder may block a move taking place this summer. Instead, attention appears to have turned to de Jong, who may be free to leave Barcelona amid their financial concerns. According to the Guardian, Chelsea are keenly monitoring any developments surrounding the 25-year-old. It comes after Manchester United agreed a fee with Barca worth around £56million with add-ons included. If the Blues are keen to match that bid, then they may be in for a transfer battle with their Premier League rivals.
