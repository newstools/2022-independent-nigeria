Williams did not get much of a look-in at Anfield last season and spent the second half of the campaign on loan at Fulham in the Championship. With Calvin Ramsay coming in through the door, competition in the right-back spot has increased even more at Liverpool. It is therefore a possibility this summer that Williams will leave the Reds and Nottingham Forest are keen on taking him on. The Tricky Trees have reached an advanced stage in the negotiations and Williams looks set to head to the City Ground. Nottingham Forest are hopeful that they can complete the signing of Williams in a matter of days as they look to replace Djed Spence, who excelled for them last season. The fee Nottingham Forest will have to pay is expected to be around £16m and Williams will be hoping that he gets ample game-time with them which would not be available at Liverpool. While on loan at Fulham, Williams made 14 Championship appearances and registered two goals along with the same number of assists, impressing for the Cottagers.
