Britain recorded its highest ever temperature of 40C° (104F) on Tuesday as a heatwave gripping Europe intensified, scorching fields, damaging runways and forcing train tracks to buckle under the pressure The Met Office said the provisional record, which still needs to be confirmed, was recorded at 12.50 pm (1150 GMT) at London’s Heathrow Airport, surpassing the previous high of 38.7C° recorded in 2019. Stephen Belcher at the Met Office said he had not expected to see 40C° in Britain in his career. “Research conducted here at the Met Office has demonstrated that it’s virtually impossible for the UK to experience 40C in an undisrupted climate but climate change driven by greenhouse gases has made these extreme temperatures possible,” he said. With the mercury still rising, train routes from London up the east and west coast of the country were canceled, normally busy city centers appeared quiet and zoos struggled to keep animals cool. Network Rail tweeted a number of pictures showing bends and kinks in rail tracks. To the east of the capital, a large fire engulfed homes in the village of Wennington, with flames tearing across neighboring tinder-dry fields and approaching a historic church. London Fire Brigade declared a major incident in response to a string of fires and urged people to stop having barbecues
