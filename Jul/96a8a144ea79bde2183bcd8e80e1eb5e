LOKOJA – In a bid to encourage voters to participate in the forthcoming general elections, and to indemnify flood victims, the Standard-bearer of the PDP for House of representatives, Ankpa, /Olamaboro/Omala Federal Constituency, Hon Joshua Adejoh has donated the sum of three Hundred Thousand naira to the people of Omala LGA to assist them in the ongoing Continue Voters Registration Exercise. Honourable Adejoh made the donation on Wednesday in Abejukolo Headquarters of Omala Local Government council. Speaking to Independent, the Campaign Anchorman, Hon. Emmanuel Ibrahim noted that the money is to help cushion the effect of flash flooding that recently ravaged the area and to provide logistics support towards mobilising unregistered voters for the INEC registration exercise in the 11 wards of Omala LGA. While empathising with the people affected by the flood, called on well-meaning sons and daughters of Omala LGA to donate generously towards ameliorating the sufferings of those affected by the flood. He however challenged candidates of other political parties to demonstrate their love for the people by donating handsomely in kind and cash to enable the people to cope with the present realities. According to him, ” This is a clarion call for those interested in getting votes from Omala to prove to the people that they are interested in their welfare and wellbeings. They are also expected to ensure that those yet to get their PVC are mobilised to participate in the CVR exercise, which is a requirement for the electorate to exercise their franchise” He urged. He enjoined voters to come out en mass to vote PDP in the general elections, saying it is only the PDP that has the capacity to rescue the country from hardship, deprivation and insecurity occasioned by APC misrule.
