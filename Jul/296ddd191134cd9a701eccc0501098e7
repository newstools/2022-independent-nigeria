AKURE – The People’s Democratic Party (PDP), Ondo State chapter, has cautioned Governor Oluwarotimi Akeredolu on the move to take over about 50,000 hectares of land in Ofosu Forest Reserve in Idanre Local Government Area of the state. A statement signed by the party’s Director, Media and Publicity, Leye Igbabo, and made available to newsmen in Akure, the state capital on Thursday, described the move as being dangerous to the farmers in the local government. The statement reads in parts: “It has become necessary to alert the world about the dangerous attempt by the Oluwarotimi Akeredolu-led APC Government in Ondo State, to violently seize 50,000 hectares of farmland from Idanre people in Idanre Local Government Area of Ondo State and cede it to private companies at the detriment of the agrarian community. The implications are indeed very grievous! “From the available records, we verily believe that the said area was constituted as a forest reserve for the joint use and benefit of Government and the native communities owning the land and therefore hold that if there was any step or move to be taken by the government on how the said area is to be put to use, it must duly carry along the community. “We are aware that sometimes in the year 2018, the community through its Traditional Council, did a letter to Ondo State Government under the leadership of Governor Oluwarotimi Akeredolu demanding the release of certain portion of the Forest Reserve to the community for farming purposes due to ever increasing agricultural needs of the people to which the Government acceded. And the community keeps on growing by the day.
