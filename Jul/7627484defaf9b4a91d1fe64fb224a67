 The Bayelsa State Governor, Douye Diri, has visited the Unit­ed Nations (UN) at its headquar­ters in New York, United States of America (USA), to strengthen collaboration between the state and the global body. Diri, who was received by the Deputy Secretary-General of the UN, Amina Mohammed, expressed the state government’s commitment to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) of the UN to improve the living conditions of the people of the state. The governor, in a statement issued on Friday by his New Me­dia Director, Kola Oredipe, said sustained collaboration with the UN would fast-track devel­opment in such areas as educa­tion, health, youth, and women empowerment, food production and the environment. According to him, the syner­gy would also enhance the pros­perity agenda of his adminis­tration to the people of Bayelsa, adding that his government was building critical infrastructures that would open up the state for great opportunities and more investments in various sectors. He described Amina Moham­med as a worthy ambassador of Nigeria and congratulated her on her successful rise to the enviable position of the deputy scribe of the UN as well as the great work she was doing at the global organisation to help hu­manity. “We have come to strength­en the existing relationship between Bayelsa State and the UN. We are committed to the attainment of the SDGs for the betterment of our people in edu­cation, health, sanitation, access to clean water and ensuring we live in a safe environment devoid of pollution,” Diri said.
