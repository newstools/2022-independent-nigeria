Jürgen Klopp’s side are reportedly seeking to bring in two Juventus talents with a combined valuation of £102.8M before the end of the transfer window, according to Gazetta Dello Sport Long-term target Matthijs de Ligt looks to be on the move this summer, and Liverpool don’t want to miss out on the opportunity to sign the Chelsea and Bayern Munich transfer target. Meanwhile, the Reds are also eyeing up Adrien Rabiot, whose Juventus contract expires next summer, to reinforce their midfield options. The Matthjis de Ligt story is an interesting one. Liverpool are well covered in central defence and don’t especially need a new centre-back. Klopp can already pick from the likes of Virgil Van Dijk, Ibrahima Konaté, Joel Matip, and Joe Gomez. Gomez’s role has grown more sporadic in recent times, and some reports suggested he could leave the Anfield club this summer, but the latest signs point towards him signing a new deal with Liverpool. With no indication Liverpool are looking to sell Van Dijk, Matip, or Konaté alongside tying down Gomez to a new deal, a move for de Ligt would be strange. -Advertisement- POLL However, the Dutchman is a hugely talented defender, and could be viewed as Van Dijk’s natural successor at Liverpool. Klopp’s side therefore may not want to miss out on signing him if he is available this summer. As for Rabiot, as more of a deep lying playmaker, he’d provide good competition for Thiago Alcantara in Liverpool’s engine room. However, Liverpool are unlikely to be legitimately interested in signing the Frenchman. After all, Juventus are said to be interested in Roberto Firmino, who Liverpool could be open to selling, but the Reds aren’t interested in including Rabiot in any kind of swap deal. With The Mirror reporting Liverpool aren’t interested in bringing in any more new signings this summer, these rumours are unlikely to materialise into anything serious.
