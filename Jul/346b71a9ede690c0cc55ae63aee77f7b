Put at N7.3 trillion at the end of 2021, there are fears that Nigeria’s fiscal deficit may take a leap further into an abysmal state considering the dwindling revenue from oil. Fiscal deficit is the difference between total revenue and total expenditure of the government. It is an indication of the total borrowings needed by the government. While calculating the total revenue, borrowings are not included. In ten months ending October 2021, Nigeria’s oil revenue stagnated at N4 trillion, undermined by increased incidences of pipeline vandalism, oil theft, and other technical issues. These issues constrained average oil production to 1.3 million barrel per day (mbpd), 13 percent below the average OPEC quota of 1.5mbpd during the period. As a result of this huge shortfall in production, Nigeria could not take advantage of the 49 percent increase in price of crude oil during the period to grow its oil revenue. This development partly accounts for the 50 percent increase in the Federal Government’s fiscal deficit in eleven months to November last year as well as the N2 trillion increase in borrowing in nine months to September last year. A report published by the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), shows that oil revenue for ten months to October 2021 (10M-21) stood at N4.03 trillion, representing very marginal increase of 0.2 percent from the N4.02 trillion recorded in the corresponding period of 2020 (10M-2020), even though most part of the 2020 was constrained by COVID-19 induced shut-ins and shutdowns. POLL According to the CBN report, oil revenue into the Federation Account comprises crude oil and gas exports, petroleum profit tax (PPT)/royalties, and domestic oil and gas sales. The report further indicated that the relative stagnation in oil revenue during 10M-21 period was occasioned by 62 percent, year-on-year (YoY) decline in crude oil and gas exports and 10 percent YoY decline in domestic oil and gas sales, which cancelled the impact of 13 percent YoY increase in revenue from PPT/royalties. The report shows that PPT/ royalties revenue rose to N2.77 trillion in 10M-21 from N2.46 trillion in 10M-2020, while its contribution to total oil revenue rose to 67 percent from 61 percent. However, crude oil and gas export revenue recorded a huge decline to N125.4 billion in 10M-21 from N326.05 billion in 10M-2020. Consequently, crude oil and gas revenue contribution to total oil revenue fell to 3.1 percent in 10M-21 from 8.0 percent in 10M-2020. Similarly, domestic oil and gas sales revenue fell to N1.04 trillion in 10M-21 from N1.16 trillion in 10M-2020. Consequently, domestic oil and gas sales revenue contribution to total oil revenue fell to 26 percent from 29 percent 10M-2020. Highlighting the factors responsible for the decline in oil revenue, the CBN’s monthly economic report stated: “Domestic crude oil production and export decreased, due to force majeure that led to pipeline shut down. “Production declined to 1.45 million barrels per day (mbpd) in October 2021, from 1.52mbpd in the preceding month. “The development was attributed to operational setbacks, with key pipelines facing persistent sabotage. “Production concerns plagued the Bonny Light, Escravos, and Forcados, while other significant grades such as Qua Iboe, Brass River, Agbami, Akpo, and Egina remained low. “Of the 1.45mbpd produced, exports accounted for an average of 1.00mbpd, while the balance was for domestic consumption.” A data from CBN revealed that the government’s actual expenditure of N11.69 trillion vastly exceeded its 2021 generated revenues of N4.39 trillion. In other words, for every N4 earned by the government, it spent over N11. The fiscal imbalance in 2021 is the largest on record since 2012 to date. Significantly, the CBN’s monthly economic report for February ’22 highlights the continuing fiscal pressures on the Nigerian economy. The latest report shows that the federation’s gross revenue fell by -11 percent year-on-year (y/y) and -15 percent month-to-month (m/m) to N799.6 billion. The gross revenue represented a shortfall of 22 percent compared with the pro-rata monthly budget benchmark of N1.02 trillion. After deductions and transfers, and some additional revenue, mainly from excess non-oil sources, the balance left for distribution to the three tiers of government amounted to N575 billion. Analysts at FBNQuest said, “The sharp fall in the gross federally collected revenue was mostly attributable to lower oil revenue. Oil’s share of gross revenues fell to a paltry 26 percent of total receipts compared with 35 percent the previous month, and 41 percent in the year-earlier period. “On a m/m basis, oil revenue fell -37 percent m/m (-44% y/y) to N208 billion. It was also well below the budgeted monthly benchmark of N506 billion. “Underpinning the drop in oil revenue were declines of -36 percent and -44 percent m/m in revenues from petroleum profit tax (PPT) & royalties and domestic crude oil & gas sales. Similar to the previous month, there were no receipts from crude oil & gas exports. “The dwindling revenue from oil sales reflects low crude oil production attributable to crude oil theft and pipeline vandalism. According to some estimates, these leakages amount to around 20 percent of the nation’s daily oil output”. Expressing their opinion, analysts at FBNQuest said, “Despite high oil prices, we anticipate that the fiscal strains will continue because of limited oil production and the government’s continued provision of fuel subsidies for gasoline, which consumes a sizable portion of the earnings from crude oil exports”.
