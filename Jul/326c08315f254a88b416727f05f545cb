Issah Bello, a plaintiff at the High Court in Abuja, has served a major online newspaper (name withheld) with a court process asking the court to compel the medium to furnish him with information surrounding one of its publications alleging that the Independent Corrupt Practices and Other Related Offences Commission (ICPC) recovered money and other properties from an Abuja home said to belong to the former Army chief. Bello is invoking the Freedom of Information (FoI Act), stating that the media house falls within agencies that could be so compelled to divulge such information for public good. The writ filed by Osuagwu Ugochukwu and St Francis Xavier Solicitors, known legal representatives of the former Army chief, and who also are counsels to the plaintiff, are asking that the medium makes an appearance as to why it has not granted its formal request for such information on its news publication. Bello, in a sworn affidavit at the High Court, Abuja, claimed to have, by a letter dated June 28, 2022, asked the media house in question to furnish him with certain information in its Custody relating to its June 23, 2022, online publication entitled: “ICPC Recovers Multi Billion naira cash, Rolex watches stockpiled in ex Army chief Buratai’s Abuja House.”
