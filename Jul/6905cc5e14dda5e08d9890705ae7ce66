LAGOS – The Director General of Jandor 2023 Campaign Organization, Dr. Seye O’Dairo, has congratulated the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) governorship candidate in Osun State and the governor-elect, Senator Ademola Adeleke, for his brilliant performance and overwhelming victory in the just concluded election in the state. The organisation, in a press statement on Sunday commended the people of Osun for supporting PDP and rejecting the All Progressives Congress (APC) at the polls even with series of intimidations and alleged attempt to buy people’s conscience, stressing that they stood their grounds and said it was time for Imole (light) to shine on Osun. “This election has proven beyond reasonable doubt that Senator Ademola Adeleke’s mandate was stolen in 2018 and the good people of Osun stood their ground to prevent another upset by the ruling party who will now be in the opposition in the state as soon as the governor-elect is sworn in.”
