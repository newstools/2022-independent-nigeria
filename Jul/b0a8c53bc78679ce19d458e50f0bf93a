The Director-General National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) has advised Corps Members to stay clear off drugs and other related offences. He gave the advice today while addressing Corps Members deployed to Yobe State at the permanent orientation camp in Dazigau, Nangere Local Government Area of Yobe State. According to him “the orientation camp is like a semi regimented environment, please keep the good work of you, conduct yourself in an orderly manner, be good ambassadors of the scheme”. He also added that the NYSC scheme has zero tolerance for cultism saying that the Corps Members should also shun misuse of the social media. Speaking on 2023 general elections, the Director-General NYSC appealed to the Corps Members not to allow themselves be used for election irregularities rather play it according to the rules. Fadah further urged them to avoid night journeys, unnecessary seeking for lifts and joining vehicles at unofficial designated parks.
