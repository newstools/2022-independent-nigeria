France marked the 80th anniversary of a massive Holocaust-era round up of Jews this weekend, recalling the country’s most notorious act of collaboration with Nazi Germany during the Vichy government. President Emmanuel Macron travelled Sunday afternoon to Pithiviers, south of Paris, for a visit to a site used to house Jews rounded up in July 1942, and an adjacent train station, through which the Jews were sent to concentration camps. Macron’s visit comes on the secondary of the anniversary of the infamous Vel’ d’Hiv Roundup, during which authorities in Vichy France rounded up 13,152 Jews in and around Paris before transferring them to Nazi camps. Some 4,100 of those detained and deported during the roundup were children. The roundup, conducted by Paris police and Vichy French Gendarmerie at the behest of Nazi forces occupying northern France, took place from July 16th to the 17th 1942. Most of the Jews detained during the roundup were sent to Auschwitz. Just 811 of those sent to the death camp survived to return to France after the war. French Prime Minister Elisabeth Borne took part in a ceremony in Paris marking the anniversary Sunday, ahead of a planned address by Macron in Pithiviers. “France delivered more than 13,000 people to torture, hatred, and death,” said Borne. POLL “It was our laws, it was our police,” Borne continued, calling the roundup the culmination of the “transition of France from a country that protects to a country that betrays itself.”
