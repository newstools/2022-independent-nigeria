July 20 marks the anniversary of International Chess Day, which was started by UNESCO to celebrate the anniversary of the International Chess Federation founded in 1924. The holiday in 1966 was first postponed by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation to celebrate the game of chess on the anniversary of the founding of the International Chess Federation, commonly known by its French acronym FIDE, in Paris in 1924. FIDE, now based in Lausanne, currently has affiliate National Chess Federations in 199 countries. The organisation was recognised by the International Olympic Committee as a Global Sporting Organisation in 1999. The group has called chess aficionados to take advantage of International Chess Day 2022 by teaching others to play the game.
