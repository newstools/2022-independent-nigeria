ORE – An industrialist, Dr. Femi Akinkuebi has called on business owners in Nigeria to seek and embrace better power alternative in order to grow and sustain their businesses. Akinkuebi who is also the Managing Director of the Ore Industrial Park in Ondo State made this statement while addressing newsmen during a tour visit of the on-going development at the facility on Thursday. While lamenting the high cost of acquiring Premium Motor Spirit/Diesel, the industrialist explained that current economic realities has greatly increased the cost of production for many businesses owners in Nigeria. Proffering solution to the challenge, Akinkuebi stated that it’s high time for people to adopt a more viable alternative to combating the challenge of high cost power supply in Nigeria. “Most factories are closing down because of diesel and petrol cost, the economic realities offers less to the sustenance of businesses outfits in Nigeria and we need a better approach. “We have zones that are dedicated for industrial purpose, and most of these zones have power, just like we have at the Ore Industrial Park and I know many other zones. “Nigerians must take advantage of these zones , we cannot be operating from our comfort zones or from our residential areas, it doesn’t work like this. “In developed Nations, people drive away from residential areas to site their business outfits in industrial zones, these industrial zones are tailored to help address the challenges of production, reducing production cost in the process “ POLL He also disclosed that right there in Ore Industrial Park, they have successfully addressed some of the major issues which militate against the growth and development of businesses, especially that of Power supply. “OIP is established on a massive 1000 hectares of eco-friendly and industrially zoned land. “The Park also has its own installed 30MW trio-fuel independent power plant which is dedicated to providing power in the park” he added.
