POLL “Nigeria is melting away, so we should pray fervently to hold this nation again. All of us irrespective of where we come from and what we believe in, we must start praying and I pray we do not loose this country. “We have tried to look for experience, it has failed us, we looked for pedigree, it has failed us, this is the reason why I said that we still need to pray to God to chose for us. “There is no way politicians will not fail, because they have one thing in common, they are selfish, they are fighting for their own pocket. We should pray to God to choose for us. “Eld-Kabir is essentially to showcase total submission to the God of creation. To commemorate the example laid by prophet Ibrahim”.
