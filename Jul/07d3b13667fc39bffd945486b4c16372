LAGOS – A group of protesters numbering about 100, stormed the Nigeria Police Zonal headquarters, Zone 2, Onikan, Lagos, on Monday to protest death threats to Olumide Sofowora, SAN, their defence counsel, who is representing in the case to enthrone Ademola Yomi Odeneye as the Alakenne of Ikenne Remo, Ogun State. Some of the protesters told journalists that since the demise of the previous Alakene Adedoyin, Gilbert Awomuti, in 1984, the need to replace him require a painstaking process of choosing the right person from a royal family, leading to the choice of Ademola Yomi Odeneye, who was selected and elected in February 2018 from among 15 persons. They further claimed that Ademola Yomi Odeneye was then chosen from the royal contenders as the Oba-elect, explaining that his selection was carried out by the statutory Osugbo Society, which has power to choose an Oba for the throne after several traditional rites were carried out and in line with the Ikenne Chieftaincy Declaration Act of 1985. Ademola Odeneye corroborated the protesters claim, saying, “The Osugbo council after due diligence arrived at my choice as the new Alakenne of Ikenne Remo, the Oba-elect. Odeneye explained further, “that Folarin Amoroge, the head of Osugbo, is about 97 years today and still alive to corroborate the process leading to my emergence as the Oba elect of Ikenne Remo.” He, however, said it came as a surprise that since his selection and election process, one Moshoodi Adeyinka Onakade went about laying claim to the throne and was supported by certain personalities in the town in total disregard to the established norms and traditional rites.
