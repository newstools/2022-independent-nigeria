***Charges INEC To Resist APC’s Manipulations ABUJA – The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has counseled the presidential candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu, to know that rushing to Abuja in the face of the defeat of his party, the APC in the Osun State governorship election cannot overturn the will of the people at the poll. Charges the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to resist the ruling party’s manipulation, the PDP said it’s already aware that APC leaders are rushing to Abuja in a desperate move to manipulate the process and frustrate the smooth conclusion of the election, having realized that the APC has been rejected by the people. PDP, in a statement by its spokesman, Hon. Debo Ologunagba said, “Asiwaju Tinubu must know that the people of Osun State have spoken and that his running to Abuja cannot save the deflated Governor Gboyega Oyetola from the reverberating verdict of the ballot box. “Our Party charges the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) and the APC leadership in Abuja to note that the course of the election is already known to all and that the people of Osun State will never accept any outcome to the contrary. The PDP charged INEC to resist the manipulations and pressure from the APC by sticking to its assurance to the people that the election will be transparent and conclusive at the first ballot. The PDP congratulated the people of Osun State and urges them to remain at alert, protect their votes and ensure that the results declared at the polling centers are not altered but duly reflected at the collation and final declaration. “We also congratulate all democratic institutions, stakeholders and all patriots who stood by the people to achieve this great shift,” the party said.
