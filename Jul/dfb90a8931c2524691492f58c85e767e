WARRI – Two-time member of the House of Representatives, Hon Solomon Ahwinahwi has called for unity among members of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP in Delta State. Chief Ahwinahwi made this call at the PDP Mega Rally in Ozoro on Saturday while speaking at the sideline. The former lawmaker called on leaders of the party to close ranks and forge a common front so as to win the general elections in 2023. He noted that the party should learn from what happened at the recent Osun governorship when the incumbent Governor lost his re-election bid as a result of in-fighting in the APC. Hon Ahwinahwi, a prominent chief in Urhoboland, lauded his teeming supporters for coming out en-masse to show support and solidarity for him at the rally. He noted that his huge support base has continued to increase in Ughelli North/Ughelli South/Udu Federal Constituency and promised not to disappoint constituents when the time comes.
