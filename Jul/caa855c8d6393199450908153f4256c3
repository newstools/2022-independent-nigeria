As the 2023 general elections gathered momentum across the country, a pan Yoruba socio-political organization, Afenifere has revealed the name of the best presidential candidate amongst the political parties in the forthcoming election. Pa Ayo Adebanjo, leader of the organization who spoke on Yoruba Gbode, an online radio programme named the presidential candidate of the Labour Party (LP), Peter Obi as the best candidate for 2023. Speaking on the programme, Adebanjo said that he has no faith in the presidential candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Asiwaju Bola Tinubu and Atiku Abubakar of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). According to the elder statesman, Peter Obi would not disappoint Nigerians if he wins the 2023 presidential election. He said, “It is only Peter Obi that can rule independently without the influence of these criminals in the government. Tinubu will only give continuity to Buhari’s incompetence. “We know Peter Obi very well, that’s why we endorsed him. He will not disappoint Nigerians, let’s put tribal differences apart and vote the right leader in. “Tinubu sold Buhari to over 200 million Nigerians for his own selfish interest of wanting to rule after Buhari. None of them loves Nigeria.” He added, “Easterners are also Nigerians, they deserve to rule. I am sure Peter Obi will not subject himself to the northerners like Tinubu and Atiku would do if elected.”
