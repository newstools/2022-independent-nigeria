Former Minister of Education, Oby Ezekwesili has decried the failure of Nigerian leaders to stabilize the economy. Ezekwesili in a series of tweets said it was innate dishonesty when an individual decides to suit his personal interest instead of going for a strategy that is inclusive. She wrote, “When innate dishonesty makes people fluctuate their rhetorics on Inclusion just to suit their personal interests, reasonable minds should never waste time analyzing to make sense of the nonsense. Just design a strategy for success that permanently shapes an Inclusive Society. “Those who squandered what remained of Nigeria’s management of our diversity and social capital cannot be expected to care about the sensitivities every reasonable mind knows to be critical in stabilizing our fractured polity. “The Siamese twins of bad governance never disappoints. It was a Country struggling to become a Nation now it struggles to remain a Country. Such failure is hugely not sustainable. I called it “The Unsustainability of Failure” in a speech some years ago.”
