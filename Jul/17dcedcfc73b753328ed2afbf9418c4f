The Personal Assistant of the Commissioner for Regional Integration and Special Duties in Osun State, Olalekan Badmus has been reportedly arrested. According to Punch, the PA to the commission was allegedly detained at the Oke Baale Police station. A post had claimed that the commissioner’s PA was arrested with thumb-printed ballot papers. The post reads, “The Personal Assistant to Hon. Lekan Badmus (Commissioner for Special Duties) of Osun State has just been arrested with thumb-printed ballots and a bag full of money for vote buying. “He is been called has been handed over to the police and currently cooling off in the cell of Oke Baale Police Station. We admonished the people to be extremely vigilant.” However, the commissioner in a statement titled, ‘News of my assistant caught with thumb printed ballot papers, fake untrue’ denied the allegation. The statement reads, “I wish to emphatically state that myself and every other person working closely with me have not engaged in any activities to sabotage the integrity of this ongoing election. “It is rather a rude shock to me that some mischief makers have been spreading false information online that my personal Assistant was caught with thumb-printed ballot papers in Osogbo ward 2 and had been handed over to the security agents. This is completely untrue. POLL “I am a man of integrity who believes in hard work and not cheap means to success. The claim that I was, by extension, involved in electoral malpractice contradicts the value I stand for. “Members of the public are hereby urged to disregard any claim or accusation of sorts suggesting that I and the people working with me were involved in electoral fraud.”
