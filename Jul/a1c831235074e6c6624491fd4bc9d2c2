Various reports across Spain suggest Barcelona are on the verge of sealing an agreement with Ousmane Dembele. The Frenchman is expected to pen a new deal with the club and is set to continue at Camp Nou for the next couple of years. Barcelona’s proposed deal reportedly involves a large pay cut for the attacker, who was initially holding out a hefty salary, but is now willing to sign a two-year deal, where much of the value is going to be based on variables. Relevo has recently offered a detailed insight into Barcelona’s proposed contract for Dembele. It appears the deal includes a pay cut of up to 40%, which is quite significant, especially considering the Frenchman’s lucrative salary demands earlier this year. However, Dembele can cushion the pay cut by meeting the variables involved in the deal. The report suggests the variables are based on his participation and performance. Having missed a chunk of games for Barcelona due to a plethora of injuries, the Barça board want to safeguard the contract by rewarding him based on the number of matches he has played for the club. The Catalans also expect Dembele to maintain the form he has shown so far this year. The player has appeared quite comfortable playing under Xavi, so one would expect him to continue his momentum and start the new season with a bang. As per Relevo, Dembele can cushion his pay cut to lower than the 30-40% reduction if he can meet these variables. The Frenchman has already expressed the desire to sign the contract, so if the two parties can dole out the final details, we may soon see Ousmane Dembele donning the Blaugrana colours yet again.
