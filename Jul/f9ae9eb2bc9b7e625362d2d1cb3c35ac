   Despite Nigeria recording the high­est inflation rate in eleven months in May 2021 and the Monetary Poli­cy Committee (MPC) of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) following with an adjustment of the mone­tary policy rate, the nation’s capital market seems to be doing well. Nigeria’s inflation rose to its highest level in 11 months, rising from 16.82 percent recorded in April 2022 to 17.71 percent in May. The Monetary Policy Committee also feels that tightening the rate would help rein in inflation before it assumes a galloping trend, con­sidering the progressive increase in headline inflation. The consumer price index, which measures the rate of inflation rose by 17.71% year-on-year in May 2022, which is 0.89% points higher than the 16.82% recorded in the previous month (April 2022). On a month-on-month basis, the headline index increased by 1.78% in May 2022, compared to the 1.76% increase re­corded in the previous month. Many analysts believe that with the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) report showing increasing inflation and as the naira contin­ues to plummet against the dollar, the purchasing power of Nigerians could be depleted even more infla­tion in Nigeria maintained a “gal­loping trend” in May, rising above expectations to 17.7 percent, against the 16.82 percent recorded in April. The persisting rise in inflation, according to Godwin Emefiele, governor, CBN, “could undermine the fragile growth recovery in Nigeria due to the associat­ed build-up of uncertainties around the cost of inventory and other production inputs”. Significantly, food inflation rose to 19.5 percent in May, from 18.4 percent in April, driven by the cost of bread and cereals and other food items, the NBS said in its Consumer Price Index report. Against this backdrop, the Nigerian Exchange (NGX) recorded the best half year performance in five years. At the close of trading on Thursday, June 30, 2021, Ni­gerian equities rebounded slightly as the benchmark in­dex managed to eke out a mea­ger 3 basis points gain to close at 51,817.59 points, the highest point since June 27. The gain contributed to keep the index well on track for its second week of gain in the month and biggest half-year gain since half-year 2017. Market capitalisation in the half year of 2022 appreciated by N5.64 trillion or 25.3 percent to close at N27.935 trillion, from the N22.297 trillion it opened for trading activities on Janu­ary 4, 2021. Consequently, the overall market performance, the NGX All-Share Index (ASI), which tracks the general market movement of all listed compa­nies on the Exchange, rose by 21.31 percent or 9,101.15 basis points to close at 51,817.59 basis points in H1 2022, the highest performance in 14 years, from 42,716.44 basis points it opened for trading. The stock market in H1 2022 maintainedpositivemomentum with domestic investors raising theirstakeamidrisinginflation­arypressureandthechallenging business environment. Also, the overall market performance, the NGX ASI, had risen by 9.95 percent to close at 46,965.48 basis points in the first quarter of 2022. Capital market analysts said H1 2022 was positive for the domestic market and urged investors to trade the stock market with caution over political uncertainty. Analysts at Cordros Secu­rities attributed the growth in stock market performance to resilience rooted in the exodus from the market due to foreign exchange (FX) liquidity issues. According to them in re­port titled, ‘Heightened un­certainties amid great policy unwind’, “This situation also limited inflows from investors and resulted in: the market be­ing dominated by domestic in­vestors and foreign investors’ inability to repatriate funds, leading to the re-investment of dividends in the market. “To buttress these points, domestic investors account­ed for an average of 86.6 per­cent of all transactions in five months of 2022, while the mar­ket performance in Q2-22 was 10.1 percent (Q1-22: 10 percent; H1 2022: 21 percent.” Also responding, David Adonri, Vice President, High­cap Securities Limited, said, “NGX ASI surged at the begin­ning of the second quarter due to the impressive 2021 full year and Q1 2022 results. The rising crude oil price also enhanced the performance of equities. However, the market slowed down in June due to unfavor­able domestic factors which the rising crude oil market could not off set. “These were the rising in­flation rate, hike in interest rate and excruciating energy crisis. As the political risk as­sociated with the 2023 general election heightens and possi­bility of further hike in inter­est rate looms, economic fun­damentals may not be strong enough to engender further market growth in H2 2022.”
