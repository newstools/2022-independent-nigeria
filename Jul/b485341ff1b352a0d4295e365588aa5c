LAGOS – Seun Anikulapo-Kuti, Afrobeat Superstar and CEO of the Egypt 80 Band, has cancelled an earlier show slated for July 2, 2022 at Jazzablanca Festival, Morroco. According to a statement from his office, the action was in an apparent act of mourning people who died on Friday trying to cross the Melilla Border into Spain. An estimated 2000 people reportedly stormed Melilla trying to cross the international border into Spain. Already, civil society organisations (CSOs) have called for an investigation into the cause of the deaths. They have also condemned any attempt to cover up the unfortunate event. Ayo Moses Ogedengbe, Seun Kuti’s spokesperson in the statement, said the band would, however, resume performance at the Marazzano Music Festival in Catania, Italy, on July 3, 2022, in continuation of its Europe tour, even as they prepare for the US tour in July.
