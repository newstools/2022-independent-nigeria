The Civil Society Committee for Anti-Fraud Election Security (CISCAES), in collaboration with another group, the 40 Million Ballots Movement, is to hold a press conference on Monday 11th July, 2022 to draw the attention of members of the public and relevant authorities to the forthcoming Osun State Governorship Election slated for July 16th. The press conference which will be held at CVL building Alhaji Balarebe Musa Crescent Victoria Island Lagos State has the theme “It is dangerous to rig Osun 2022 Guber Poll ” and will amongst other salient issues, address the need to ensure that Osun state governorship election is not manipulated by INEC or the presidency. The media briefing, which will host the Convener of Civil Society Committee for Anti-Fraud Election Security Comrade Kennedy Iyere and other very important dignitaries, will highlight the fact that the Civil Society Committee for Anti-Fraud Election Security was on ground to monitor the Ekiti governorship election and that the verdict it passed was that the election left much to be desired. Again, the press conference will consider the need that it has become imperative to review the alarm of the authenticated assertions by CISCAES which reinforced those of other observers and of the press to confirm that the recently conducted Ekiti State Guber poll was marred by massive fraudulent practices. It will also take cognisance of the fact that during Ekiti State Governorship Election massive vote-buying and technical manipulations of the voting process by INEC officials were rampant. That given the foregoing, it would be imperative to initiate a proactive anti-fraud intervention process ahead of the forthcoming Osun State 2022 Guber Poll, slated for Saturday 16th July, 2022. That CISCAES is taking the responsibility to alert the generality of Nigerians and the international community that unless proactive preventive measures are adopted to forestall fraudulent practises, it has become predictable that the Osun State Guber Poll will inevitably be rigged just like the Ekiti State election. The press conference will also encourage Nigerians to do everything possible within their means to protect the voting processes of the Osun State 2022 Guber Poll from being hijacked and manipulated by the powers be as such would expose the 2023 general election to massive riggings.
