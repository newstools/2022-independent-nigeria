…Condemns Alleged Renting Of Fake Bishops By APC ASABA – The Convener of Country First Movement, Prof Chris Mustapha Nwaokobia has Lambasted the Presidential Candidate of All Progressive Congress (APC) for the 2023 general elections in Nigeria, Asiwaju Ahmed Tinubu On alleged renting of fake Bishops at the unveiling of APC’s Vice Presidential Candidate, Kashim Shettima, while he bemoaned APC’s show of false propaganda, hypocrisy, arrogance, and poor political strategy. Prof Chris Mustapha Nwaokobia made this remark in a press statement made available to some group of Journalists today being on Friday, 22nd day of July, 2022 in Asaba, Delta State capital as he joined Nigerians, Political Analysts, CAN and other opposition Political parties to condemned the snacks of fakery. No doubt, wider condemnation by Nigerians trailed the videos and pictures of the priests, Bishops who attended the unveiling of APC’s Presidential Candidate, Kashim Shettima went viral, as Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) disowned, said those Bishops were fake, rented priests and cannot be identified by the umbrella, which APC’s Presidential Campaign Organization in a press statement, later debunked that those attended were not rented. One of the leaders of OBI-DIENT Movement, OBI-DATT believers, Professor Chris Mustapha Nwaokobia Jnr has bashed the press statement by Tinubu’s Campaign Organization, while questioning the status, identity of the alleged rented Priests, Bishops, he regarded APC’s statement as false propaganda distance from logic and clear thought. The statement reads in parts: “Everything about the Presidential Candidate of All Progressive Congress (APC), Asiwaju Ahmed Tinubu is questionable. APC as a party has started its campaign with poor strategy and false propaganda. If his entire resume smacks of fakery, should the status or identity of ‘rented’ Priests and Bishops bother us”. POLL “Campaign will soon start, and those who do not realize the emptiness of the ‘master strategist’ and the deficiency in tact of his Team will be amazed. Arrogance is not strategy, hypocrisy is far from wisdom, and false propaganda distant from logic and clear thought”.
