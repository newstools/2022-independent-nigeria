Rangers have reportedly agreed a fee of £6million with Southampton for Joe Aribo. The NIgerian international won;t be signing a new deal at Ibrox with his current contract set to expire next summer. As a result, the club have opted to cash in rather than lose him for nothing in a year’s time and have done a deal with the Saints. The English Premier League outfit will pay £6million up front for Aribo, according to The Athletic, which could rise to more than £10million with add-ons included. Aribo is expected to undergo his medical and could officially seal his move to the south coast club in the days ahead. Record Sport first revealed Ralph Hasenhuttl’s interest back in December but a January move didn’t come to fruition with Gio van Bronckhorst keen to keep him for the Europa League knockout stages. However he has now entered the final year of his contract and after he made it clear to the club he would not sign the deal on the table, they have decided to cash in. The fee in question is a bargain from Southampton’s perspective for the 25-year-old but it represents a major profit for Rangers on the £300,000 they paid to sign him from Charlton. They’re likely to put a chunk of the cash towards new signings with a deal for Antonio Colak close and Congolese winger Theo Bongonda a reported £6m target. Attentions may now turn to tying down Alfredo Morelos and Ryan Kent, who like Aribo are out of contract in 2023. Van Bronckhorst won’t want to lose more than one of his key men this summer and any offer to take those two away would likely need to be significantly higher than that on the table for Aribo.
