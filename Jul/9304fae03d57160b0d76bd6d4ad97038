Barcelona are now said to have agreed a deal with Robert Lewandowski ahead of the striker’s potential move to Camp Nou. Lewandowski is being heavily linked with a move away from Bayern Munich this summer, a year before his contract expires. The striker is no longer seeing aye-to-eye with the club’s board, and he has made it clear he wants a new challenge this summer. Barcelona are very keen, but Bayern are not making it easy, still wanting a big fee for their 33-year-old despite his contract situation. In their defender, the striker has scored more than 40 years in the last two seasons, so his age isn’t really a factor. According to Sport, Barca are still yet to agree a deal with Bayern, but they have submitted a proposal worth around £34million. Though, in the meantime, it’s said Barca have a pact with Lewandowski to complete a contract agreement. The striker is said to have promised his future to Barcelona based on a contract proposal, on the condition they can complete a deal. -Advertisement- POLL Barcelona do have ongoing financial issues, but the sale of key assets in the coming weeks, as approved by the board, should help.
