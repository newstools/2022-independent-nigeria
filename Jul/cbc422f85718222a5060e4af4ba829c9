The outrage stoked by the Muslim – Muslim choice foisted on supporters of the All Progressives Congress (APC) continues to reverberate as the ruling party on Thursday shelved the unveiling of Alhaji Kassim Shettima by the party’s flagbearer Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu. No reason was advanced for the cancellation of the planned presentation of the VP candidate to the party. However, two different sources offered contradictory explanations for the cancellation of the program earlier fixed for 1.00 pm on Thursday at the APC national secretariat. One of the sources claimed that the program was halted following a directive from the presidency, suggesting that national outrage and resignations that reverberated across the party in the aftermath of the Muslim -Muslim ticket may be the reason. The other source claimed that the VP candidate himself requested for the adjustment on grounds that he is currently mourning a nephew. However, some stakeholders of the party who spoke to this reporter picked holes in the two explanations, insisting that the presidency couldn’t have interfered in a choice that has been sealed by the presidential candidate of the party, as doing so would cast Tinubu and the party in a bad light. Similarly, chieftains of the party also doubted the claim that Alhaji Shettima was bereaved of a relative, pointing out that the demise of a nephew cannot be a strong enough reason to cancel a national assignment of the party.
