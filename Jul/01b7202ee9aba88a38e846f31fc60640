LAGOS – Worried by the prolonged strike by the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU), the Special Adviser on Education (SAE) to Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu, Mr. Tokunbo Wahab has appealed to the Federal Government and stakeholders to intervene and end the five-month-old industrial action. He made the appeal to ASUU and other sister unions on Tuesday when members of the Education Writers Association of Nigeria (EWAN) paid him a courtesy visit in his office at Alausa. Wahab, who acknowledged EWAN as partners in the development of education, said the ASUU strike has to be called off to enable the students to go back to their studies that had been truncated for over five months. According to him, ASUU needs to change its approach to strike as no nation can develop with its youths at home for months “because an idle hand is a devil’s workshop.” His words: “We can’t continue to keep Nigerian youths at home for several months. No nation can develop with its active youths at home for over five months. The federal government and concerned stakeholders must act fast to end the prolonged strike.” Wahab disclosed that because Lagos State University is not on strike, many applicants in the last Unified Tertiary Matriculation Examination (UTME) chose its three public universities. He said the Lagos State University (LASU), Lagos State University of Science and Technology (LASUST) and the Lagos State University of Education (LASUED) are now oversubscribed in the 2022 UTME application. “LASU and the two new universities are not on strike but we are worried that at the national level, students have been at home for months. Because of the absence of strike in LASU and the new universities, we are currently over subscribed,” he stated.
