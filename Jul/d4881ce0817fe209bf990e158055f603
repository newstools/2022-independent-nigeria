Despite the majority move against the joint Muslim-Muslim ticket in the 2023 general elections, the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) will on Wednesday, July 20 officially unveiled its Vice Presidential candidate, Senator Kashim Shettima to Nigerians. The party made this known in a statement issued on Tuesday by its National Organizing Secretary, Sulaiman Muhammed Argungun. According to Argungun, the event is billed to hold at the Shehu Musa Yar’Adua Centre, Abuja by 11.00 am, adding that those expected at the event are all members of the National Executive Committee (NEC), Progressives Governors’ Forum (PGF) and APC Caucus in the National Assembly. Others are all members of the Federal Executive Council (FEC), Diplomatic Corps, presidential aspirants at the June 2022 national convention, APC state chairmen, secretaries and state organising secretaries. The APC National Chairman, Senator Abdullahi Adamu would preside over the occasion while the presidential candidate of the party, Bola Ahmed Tinubu, would also be in attendance. The statement further revealed that Shettima would have been unveiled last week but the event was postponed due to the Osun Governorship election. It could not be far forgotten that the former Governor of Lagos State and APC standard flagbearer had recently picked Shettima, former Governor of Borno State as his running mate for 2023. The move had attracted criticism as he was accused of running under a Muslim-Muslim ticket for the 2023 presidency.
