Former presidential aide, Reno Omokri has come under fire after claiming that the supporters of the presidential candidate of the Labour Party, Peter Obi are after his life, wife and children. Omokri on Friday had taken to his Twitter account to call out the supporters of Obi over their consistent attacks online. Reacting to this, investigative journalist, David Hundeyin, has condemned Omokri, stating that the political activist left his wife and chased an Ethiopian babe and he is living in London. According to Hundeyin, Omokri abandoned his wife and three children all by herself in California, United States of America. Hundeyin in a series of posts on Twitter wrote, “OK I’m going to bite because I’ve had just about enough of this guy. “Which of the wives and children, Reno? Is it your legally married wife Tuokpe whom you abandoned in Antioch, California to chase the Ethiopian babe you impregnated and are now living with in London? “Since when did you care about your wife and children, Reno? Was it when you abandoned Tuokpe with your 3 children including a special needs kid all by herself in California and you had a child with another woman you’re living with? “The Bible you can’t shut up about says Proverbs 5:18: “Let your wife be a fountain of blessing for you. Rejoice in the wife of your youth.” POLL “You abandoned the wife of your youth with 3 children and moved to another country with a younger woman and you have THE NERVE to speak? “Created a whole Instagram page for his love child while neglecting his 3 children with his legally married wife. A despicable human.”
