 LAGOS – The Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) said there is an urgent need to rethink financial sys­tem regulation, supervision and monetary policy imple­mentation. CBN Governor, Godwin Emefiele, said this while declar­ing open the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) retreat in Lagos on Friday. The retreat, which is being attended by top management of the bank, which includes the four deputy governors, direc­tors of the bank, economists within and outside the bank, will run through the weekend, and will be followed by the stat­utory MPC meeting which will be held on Monday and Tues­day next week. He said, “Monetary policy has been severely challenged, as its policy space narrowed significantly, in some cases, paradoxically and necessitat­ing the need to rethink mon­etary policy in the context of emerging challenges and eco­nomic transformation. “The central banking and monetary policy relevance in the digital ecosystem is some­times challenged as the regu­latory oversight functions are largely eroded or weakened by impotency of traditional tools in carrying out those functions. “While the Nigerian econ­omy has been engulfed with many crises, just like many other countries of the world, we have been able to relatively withstand the storm and have performed far better than many of our pairs, courtesy of our bespoke and ingenious approach of adopting well thought out and home-grown policy measures to address our macroeconomic challenges. “I, therefore, commend our choice of the theme of this retreat ‘Monetary Policy implementation in a digitally evolving developing economy’’. POLL He added that the evolution of FinTechs, cryptocurren­cies, digital payments, artifi­cial intelligence and Machine Learning, have changed the functioning of the financial and banking sectors, both glob­ally and domestically. “Indeed, while post-COVID growth recovery in Nigeria can be adjudged to be moderate and stable, we have seen a ma­jor change in the key sectoral drivers of that stable growth phenomenon, including the services sector, modernised agriculture, and manufactur­ing, suggesting that technolo­gy and innovation is playing a major role in output growth and economic development in Nigeria.”
