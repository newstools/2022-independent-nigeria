Chelsea misfit Hakim Ziyech is getting closer to becoming a new Milan player as talks between the sides are progressing well. As per Fabrizio Romano, negotiations between the Rossoneri and the player’s representatives are ongoing. It is no secret that Milan boss Stefano Pioli aims to strengthen his attacking options this summer. Rafael Leao was nothing short of exceptional last season. Yet, he will need back up next season as the Serie A champions are set to battle on multiple fronts. Junior Messias and Alexis Saelemaekers played their part in helping Milan dethrone Inter last term. But they are not the Champions League material, as witnessed by the Italians’ underwhelming European campaign in 2021/22. Pioli sees Ziyech as an immediate upgrade on both aforementioned wingers. The Morocco international has delivered a mixed bag of performances at Chelsea since he arrived from Ajax in 2020. A lack of consistency has seen him become a bit-part player in Thomas Tuchel’s set-up. Chelsea will entertain offers for the 29-year-old this summer. Tuchel’s side will undergo massive changes under the new ownership structure. Unfortunately for Ziyech, he has no place in the Blues’ plans for next season. Aware of his current status at Stamford Bridge, he will embrace any chance to secure regular first-team football away from London. And he seems to have set his sights on joining Milan. The Rossoneri have made a breakthrough in talks with the player’s entourages. However, they have yet to find a deal with Chelsea. Milan would like to sign Ziyech on a season-long loan with an option to buy. It is still uncertain whether the Pensioners would agree to such terms. The sides are working on the potential formula of the deal. Even though there is no agreement yet, Milan are growing confident about landing Ziyech in the coming weeks.
