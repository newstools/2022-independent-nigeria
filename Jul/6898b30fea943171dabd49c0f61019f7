Super Falcons goalkeeper, Chiamaka Nnadozie, has described the team’s Women’s Africa Cup of Nations semifinal match against Morocco last Monday as the world match she ever played. Nnadozie was critical of the referee decisions that went against Falcons with two of their players sent off in the second half of the game with the game at 1-1. Consequently Falcons with nine players played 11 women Morocco for 50 minutes (20 minutes of regulation time and 30 minutes of extra time) without conceding. But in the resultant penalty shootout, Falcons scored four to Morocco’s five and Nigeria crashed out of the gold medal game and the hope of 10th title halted for now. The Flacons goalkeeper was irked by the referee action that resulted in the elimination of the team and concluded that despite losing the game, Falcons were the better side. “The Moroccan team knew that Nigeria is a great team, so to beat us they had to distract us,” Nnadozie, who was awarded, the Women-of the match award, wrote on her social media pages, was quoted by Goal. com. “They did everything they did just to distract us. Since I have been playing football, this is the worst match I have ever played in my life. “They won but this is not winning for me. The officiating was not really okay. If they were good enough, we were nine players against 11, they would have scored and won. POLL That is to show you how great we are.” Nnadozie further explained why she was proud of the Super Falcons despite the defeat.
