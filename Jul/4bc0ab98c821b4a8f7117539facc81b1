A Professor of Political Science from Usman Dan-Fodio University Sokoto, Professor Ibrahim Bande Zagga has said that President Muhammadu Buhari-led Federal Government is clearly not serious and not ready to end the ongiong nationwide strike embarked upon by the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU). Professor Zagga who spoke exclusively to Vanguard in Birnin Kebbi said that the foot-dragging by the federal government indicated a lack of interest and seriousness not only on ASUU but issues on public education as a whole. He said, “how much ASUU requires to end the strike, it is very simple committees comprising the union and the federal government have met and reports were submitted to the federal government is just for the government to implement it period. He noted that the five-month-old strike kept the students at home and their lecturers whom he said do not only teach but do other things like community work and others to keep the universities going. In another development, he said noise about same faith ticket is nothing but a promotion of selfish interest by some group of politicians who wants to use it cause confusion otherwise late Abiola did it in 1993 he won but he died and very recently Osun with a large number of Muslims voted same faith ticket so it is about religion but a patriotic leader who can bail out the country Muslim-Muslim or Christian it does not matter. Professor Zagga alleged that the federal government is also not serious about ending banditry in the country saying the president’s home state too Katsina is under siege not to talk of other states that are also being ravaged by bandits lamenting that, despite Army barracks across the country and Buhari as ex-General banditry persisted in the country displacing thousands and disallowed millions of farmers from accessing their farms to ensure the food sufficiency which his government pledged Nigerians.
