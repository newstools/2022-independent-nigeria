The Senator representing Ebonyi South Senatorial District, Michael Ama Nnachi, has visited Eke market, in Afikpo North Local Government Area of Ebonyi State, razed by fire. The fire which occurred last week razed a section of the market, destroying goods worth millions of Naira, though no life was lost. Nnachi while commiserating with the traders over the loss of their properties, advised them to always take precautionary measures, to avoid future occurrences. He donated the sum of N3 million to the victims of the fire incident and assured them of his continuous presence to provide good representation to them. “This is a very colossal loss to the owners of the items that were burnt and the building itself. As your representative, I must commiserate with you, we sympathize with all of you. “There’s nothing much we can do as human beings than to say the traders should take heart, and God will replenish their purse, to enable them to take good care of their families. “I advise you to be conscious of this kind of occurrence when building the shops next time, and you have to take precautions and make individual efforts to protect your goods”, Nnachi said. The Chairman of the Afikpo market amalgamated traders association, Mr Johnson Inya Oka, described the visit as a much-needed solace for the traders.
