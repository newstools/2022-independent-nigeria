Popular Nigerian businessman and Philanthropist, Femi Otedola on Tuesday endorsed the presidential candidate of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), Asiwaju Bola Tinubu to become the next President of Nigeria in 2023. The 59-year-old billionaire business mogul who made this known after he visited Tinubu in France described him as a ‘great friend’ while praying for the success of his presidential bid in the forthcoming elections. Taking to his verified Twitter handle with excitement, Otedola tweeted a picture he took with Tinubu and wrote, “I am always excited visiting my Great Friend Asiwaju Ahmed Bola Tinubu @officialABAT. May God grant him his heart’s desire to become the President of this great Nation.” Otedola’s visit is coming a day after the Governor of Ogun State, Dapo Abiodun, also visited Tinubu in France and took a picture with him. Abiodun in a tweet on Monday said he spent “quality time” with Tinubu to “rub minds on numerous party and National issues.” It could be recalled that Tinubu travelled to France last week after meeting with President Muhammadu Buhari at the Presidential Villa, Abuja, on Monday morning. His spokesman, Tunde Rahman, who announced the departure, did not state how long the APC standard-bearer would be away but said Tinubu was expected back in the country shortly. “He is off to Paris, France to hold some important meetings,” Rahman said in a statement.
