While ensuring that despite security challenges, the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC, remained committed to the timelines for the conduct of the next general elections, Agboke stressed the need for all stakeholders, particularly security operatives to synergize together for a smooth electoral process next year Also, the chairman of the event, Professor Femi Bamiro in his address enlisted some obstacles in the previous electoral dispensations and charged necessary stakeholders to ensure they deliver on their mandate to the people as any disruption or lack of trust from them might portend grave dangers to the process.
