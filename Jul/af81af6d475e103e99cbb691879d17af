Nigerian activist, Deji Adeyanju has expressed his frustration over the failed alliance between Peter Obi of the Labour Party, LP, and Rabiu Kwankwaso of the New Nigeria Peoples Party (NNPP). Adeyanju via his verified Facebook account stated that he could not understand the reason both presidential candidates could not put aside their differences and merge their parties. He wrote, I’m just sincerely angry with Nigerian politicians. Very selfish people. I can’t understand why Obi & Kwankwaso can’t agree to work together. If they can’t beg Atiku to work with them, will understand but these 2 running futile individual campaigns is something I can’t ever understand. Completely irritated!
