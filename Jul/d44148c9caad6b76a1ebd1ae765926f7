Manchester United are already preparing for life after Cristiano Ronaldo, say reports, after the Portuguese striker submitted a stunning transfer request on Saturday. A report revealed that the 37-year-old has asked to be allowed to leave if an acceptable offer comes in. He wants to play Champions League football next season, believing he still has another “three or four years” left at the top level. According to the Sunday Mirror (opens in new tab), United boss Erik ten Hag will act quickly by encouraging the Old Trafford hierarchy to bring in Ajax winger Antony as Ronaldo’s replacement. The Dutch club’s £70 million demands for the Brazil international earlier this summer were considered too steep, but Ten Hag wants the club to press ahead with their pursuit if Ronaldo goes. But United have continued to insist that Ronaldo isn’t for sale, amid links with Chelsea and Bayern Munich. Several of Ten Hag’s former players, including Frenkie de Jong, Lisandro Martinez (opens in new tab), Jurrien Timber and Antony, have been among United’s targets this summer. Antony scored eight goals in 23 Eredivisie games for Ten Hag’s title-winning Ajax side last season. -Advertisement- POLL The 22-year-old winger has a contract in Amsterdam until 2025 and is valued at £31.5 million by online portal Transfermarkt.
