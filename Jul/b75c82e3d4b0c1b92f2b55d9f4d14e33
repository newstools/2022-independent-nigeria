A former Presidential aspirant, Adamu Garba, has rejoined the All Progressives Congress (APC) after defecting to the Young Progressives Party (YPP). Garba left the ruling party to contest for the YPP presidential ticket but lost to Malik Ado-Ibrahim. He had said, “I was a strong member of the PDP in 1999, in 2003 we moved to ANPP and in 2007 we came to PDP and stayed till 2014 when APC founded and we moved,” In a turn of events, the politician in a tweet said he is back in the ruling party. He tweeted, “Yes, I am fully back to APC. I could do more harm to my country, Nigeria if I did not support a combination of a great strategist and a great tactician on a single ticket. “It is BAT/Hashim that should take over all polling units in Nigeria come 2023. RE-DECAMPED!”
