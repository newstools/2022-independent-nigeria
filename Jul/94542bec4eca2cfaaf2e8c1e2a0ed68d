 A senator who represented Ebonyi Central Zone in the Senate, Emmanuel Onwe, has urged the Economic and Financial Crimes Com­mission, the Federal Inves­tigation Bureau and the De­partment of States Services to urgently investigate the alleged contract racketeer­ing against Express Con­cerns International Ltd by one Mr Onny Igbokwe, who parades as a whistleblower. Onwe’s call for investiga­tions of the company, followed a petition allegedly written by Igbokwe, through his lawyers, Kanu Ogbonnia .O. and Co, to the Presidential Amnesty Programme; the Federal Min­istry of Justice; among others, claiming that he (Onwe) and Express Concerns Interna­tional Ltd were involved in an illegal N500 million deal. Igbokwe, in the petition against Onwe and the com­pany, dated June 10, 2022, a copy of which was sighted by our correspondent, claimed he was the founding father of the Presidential Amnes­ty Training contract pro­gramme.
