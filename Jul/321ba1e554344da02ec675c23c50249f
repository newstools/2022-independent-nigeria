Abuja – A total of 266 ecological projects have been completed across the country in the last seven years (2015-2022), President Muhammadu Buhari declared on Wednesday in Abuja. Speaking at the launch of a compendium of ecological projects undertaken by this administration, the president said 332 ecological projects were approved during the period under review, out of which 266 were accomplished while the remaining 66 are at different stages of completion. The president, who launched the publication before the commencement of the Federal Executive Council (FEC) meeting, commended the Secretary to the Government of the Federation and the management team of the Ecological Project Office (EPO), for the judicious use of available resources for the effective implementation of approved projects, as well as the initiative for the publication. In order to leverage the benefits accruable to government from the commendable efforts of the EPO, and the effective communication of these efforts through the publication, the president directed ministries, departments and agencies (MDAs) which have not done so to showcase their performance and achievements to the public. “The enormity of Nigeria’s ecological problems and inherited infrastructural deficit in general, has the tendency, like the proverbial drop in the ocean, to always drown our achievements in addressing ecological challenges and infrastructural deficit at large. “It is against this background that publications like the one being launched today, become very important and a useful tool in correcting the negative public perception, that government has not done anything in addressing these challenges.”
