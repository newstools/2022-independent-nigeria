ABAKALIKI – National Population Commission (NPC), Ebonyi State, has captured locations of mad people, and other special populations in the State ahead of the 2023 national census. The other captured special populations include nomads and farmers who migrate from their homes to farm settlements. This was on Friday disclosed by Honourable Darlington Okereke, Federal Commissioner, NPC, Ebonyi State on the occasion of a press briefing at the Commission’s office in Abakaiki, Ebonyi State capital. He explained that “we have captured where they live, the locations so, when we start the census, we shall send people there so that they will be counted. We want to get everyone counted”. He said, “I am pleased to welcome you to this press briefing on the commencement of the Trial Census in preparation for the first fully digital census in Nigeria in April 2023”. Okereke noted that President Muhammadu Buhari had acted on the advice of the National Council of State approved the conduct of the Trial Census for June 2022 and the next population and Housing Census in April 2023. “This approval underscores the President’s commitment towards sustainable development of the country. The President has by this singular action demonstrated his desire to place the welfare of the Nigerian people at the centre of governance in Nigeria”, he stated. The NPC boss revealed that consequent upon the approval by President Buhari, the Commission intensified preparatory activities deploying technological innovations on a massive scale to conduct a truly scientific census that would not only be accurate and reliable but also transparent and acceptable to all Nigerians. -Advertisement- POLL “As you are aware, the Commission has carried out the demarcation of the entire land mass of Nigeria into small Enumeration Areas that can be covered by a team of enumerators, and the first and second pretest to the census instruments,” he stated.
