Jesse Lingard has signed a bumper contract approaching £200,000 a week with newly-promoted Nottingham Forest in the shock deal of this summer’s transfer window. The England international, who left Manchester United at the end of his contract, turned his back on West Ham to sign for Forest after passing a medical on Wednesday, and could make his debut in the friendly with Union Berlin in Germany on Saturday. Lingard is thought to have signed an initial 12-month deal though Forest will be hoping to extend that if he performs well. The 29-year-old has not given up hope of forcing his way into Gareth Southgate’s squad for this winter’s World Cup in Qatar, after he was a key man in England’s run to the semi-finals four years ago.
