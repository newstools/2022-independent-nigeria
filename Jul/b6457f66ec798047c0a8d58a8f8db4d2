Romelu Lukaku seems to have no intention of returning to Chelsea and the feeling is mutual, with reports there is already an agreement in principle to leave him on loan at Inter for a second season. The striker was sold to the Premier League side last summer for €113m and almost immediately regretted his decision, pushing for a return since December 2021. He made the comeback on loan for €7m plus €3m in performance-related bonuses and has been all smiles with the Nerazzurri, joking with teammates about his “mistake” in leaving the first time. It is evident he wants to make it a permanent switch, but Inter cannot afford to repay the €100m fee, nor do Chelsea need him back under Thomas Tuchel. According to Sportsmail and the Daily Telegraph, the two clubs realised this would happen and have already reached an agreement in principle to leave Lukaku on loan at San Siro for the 2023-24 campaign too. The striker already took a pay cut to make the loan work and would do so again, perhaps even with a discount on the €7m plus €3m add-ons charge.
