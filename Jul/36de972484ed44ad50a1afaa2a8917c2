LAGOS – Non-Governmental Organisation, Pistis Empowerment Foundation (PEF), has said it will provide surgical and medical treatments to 5,000 people for its 2022 Ubomi Medical Outreach. A statement by PEF said that the outreach would hold from Monday 4th to Friday 8th July 2022 at Mother and Child Centre, Ogombo Road, Ajah, Lagos. For the sake of clarity, Pistis Foundation is a social intervention vehicle of the Elevation Church, and its activities this year at Ogbombo as mentioned in the foregoing is going to be a week-long free surgical and medical outreach that would cater for thousands of under-served members of its community. Unarguably inspired by inaccessibility of medical care by a huge demographic segment of the population, Pistis Foundation has stated thus, “Access is still the greatest challenge to health care delivery in Africa. Fewer than 50% of Africans have access to modern health facilities. Many African countries spend less than 10% of their GDP on health care. It assured that through its medical interventions, that it can serve its community and thereby show them the love of Christ, even as it equally assured that it can provide health care to the less privileged by partnering with medical doctors and health care givers. It stated, “You can help by joining a medical team to reach people with poor access to healthcare. As part of a medical intervention, you’ll not only meet tangible needs, you’ll help church members build relationships and introduce others to Christ. Join us today. Godman Akinlabi, the founder, who is also the Global Lead Pastor of The Elevation Church, said: “Many years ago, we realised what faith-based non-for-profit organisations can do to ameliorate the sufferings of the underprivileged. “Our response to this gap was to create a special vehicle to cater to the needs of these people, outside the religious sphere with a special focus on Health, Education, and Shelter’’, he said.
