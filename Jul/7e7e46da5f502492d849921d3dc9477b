A group, Northern Voices for Equity and Justice (NVEJ), has petitioned the Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Mr. Abubakar Malami, over what it called an unfair distribution of the ongoing Nigerian Liquefied Natural Gas (NLNG) Train 7 Project contracts across all regions of the country. In a statement made available to journalists, the group, led by Kabir Ahmed, alleged that managers of the NLNG Train 7 Project, including the contractors, Saipem, Daewoo and the Nigerian Content Development and Monitoring Board (NCDMB), were deliberately awarding contracts for the project to their proxies, associates and cronies to the exclusion of parts of Nigeria. The NLNG project was expected to increase the six processing trains of the plant in Bonny to seven trains as well increase the current installed capacity to 30 MPTA With the approved vendors’ list exceeding over 300, the NVEJ stated that there was hardly any company from the northern part of Nigeria or their business interests that were involved. Describing it as a major missing link that continued to fuel the unending divide within the Nigerian socio-economic and political structure, the group maintained that the project remained in excess of $10 billion (N6 trillion). It stated that this is inclusive of Engineering, Procurement, Construction, Installation and Commission (EPCIC) and was expected to stretch till 2027 or a little beyond if everything goes well. “Much as we appreciate and support the participation and capacity building of our brothers and sisters in the Niger Delta and the entire South by extension through various projects in the Nigerian oil and gas industry, it has become imperative that these project managers must not look away from other regions,” it said.
