While Oscar Mingueza’s departure from Camp Nou is certain, Barcelona’s asking price of €5 million has forced several suitors to leave the negotiation mid-way. As reported by the Spanish publication Mundo Deportivo, Mingueza is currently on a week-long leave as he continues to assess his future options. He understands that there is no place for him in the current roster, but the price tag Barcelona have put is making it difficult for the suitor to advance. For now, Barcelona’s idea to recoup €5 million from his sale comes due to his ongoing contract which ends in 2023. Several teams were thought to be in the race but a few have now decided to put their interest in ‘standby’. Interestingly enough, the last team to talk to Barcelona about Mingueza’s availability was Serie A side Monza. The newly-promoted Italian side seem very much interested but are not willing to match Barcelona’s valuation of the player. Hence, they are trying to persuade Barcelona to look for a different approach to finalise the transfer. And as far as the player is concerned, he is pretty much attracted to the project that former Italy president Silvio Berlusconi is building. The team have made some good business in the transfer market and are willing to invest more. For Mingueza, however, they have proposed a few new formulae like a loan deal with a purchase option. This would ideally force Barcelona to hand the defender a new contract or they will be at risk of losing him for free next year. Or else, there could be a smaller fixed plus variables fee that could eventually reach the demanded €5 million. Meanwhile, in addition to attracting interest from Monza, Mingueza is also waiting to see if he can get a bid from a Spanish team. For now, the likes of Getafe, Real Valladolid, Celta de Vigo, Mallorca and Elche have enquired about him but there is nothing concrete from their front.
