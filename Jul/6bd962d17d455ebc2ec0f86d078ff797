The Governor of Kano State, Abdullahi Ganduje on Saturday said that the presidential candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Asiwaju Bola Tinubu is not an experimental president given his dexterity and strong rooting in politics and administration in the Nigerian project. Governor Ganduje made the assertion when he received an award from the National Coalition of Tinubu Support Groups Worldwide, the national directorate, comprising Nigeria, United States, United Kingdom, Canada, Ireland, Germany, South Africa, Saudi Arabia, Brazil, Oman, and the United Arab Emirates chapters, for his leading role in Tinubu’s victory at the party’s primary election. Speaking at the occasion, the Governor said that given his outstanding performance as Lagos State Governor where he formed a formidable team made up of people from different parts of the country that transformed the state to the strongest economy in the sub-region, Asiwaju’s presidency could best manage our diversity. He pointed out that Asiwaju’s emergence at the primary election gave hope and encouragement that the party was set to win the 2023 election. He, however, expressed appreciation for the recognition by the coalition and promised to work harder for the success of Asiwaju’s presidential candidature in the 2023 general elections. The Convener and Global Director-General of the coalition, Dr Doyin Johnson earlier in his address had said the award was presented to him as a way of saying ‘thank you’ for the strategic role he played in the actualisation of Asiwaju presidency. He charged the governor to continue to use his intellectual capacity and strong mobilisation prowess to ensure the success of the APC presidential candidate at the polls. Correspondingly, the Imo State Governor, Hope Uzodimma, who was part of the delegation, urged the governor, whom he described as a man of honour, to further map out strategies for winning the secondary election come 2023.
