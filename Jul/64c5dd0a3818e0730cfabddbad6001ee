The promise of God for Solomon has again come to fulfilment at the Redeemed Christian Church of God (RCCG), Jesus Embassy Cathedral, Ekiti Province 7, Ado-Ekiti, Ekiti State, as the Pastor-in-charge of the Province, Pastor Gabriel Akintude Adarabioyo, who embarked on the demolition of the church in 2018, shortly after he was posted to the province with the hope of building a modern Cathedral for the members has realised his dream. Being the pioneer PICP of Ekiti Province 7, Pastor Adarabioyo thought it wise to have a befitting house of God where the people could worship comfortably as God said concerning Solomon the son of King David. “He shall build a house for my name, and he shall be my son and I will be his father; and I will establish the throne of his kingdom over Israel forever,” (Chronicles 22:10). The Cathedral built by this man of God, who is usually addressed as the set man of the Province, Pastor Gabriel Akintude Adarabioyo, has been billed for dedication on Sunday, July 10, 2022. The dedication ceremony which would attract men and women of God from all walks of life on the scheduled date is expected to be well attended by all members of the province as adequate arrangements including security measures have been put in place towards making the occasion a hitchfree as explained by Pastor Adarabioyo. The PICP therefore enjoined everyone coming for the occasion to be well-dressed and conduct themselves in a Godly manner. He equally called on well-todo individuals in the society that are still willing to contribute towards the laudable project never to hesitate adding that God’s blessings await them.
