ABUJA  – With costs of fuel high, taxes unyielding while regulatory bodies go on what many perceive as overdrive, cost living, and misery indexes in the nation’s capital has remained high with no hope of it coming down soon, according to perception survey carried out by Daily Independent, based on media reports. As mid-week, prices of staple food have continued to increase in Abuja and states contiguous to it. An agency report survey, for instance, revealed that in Nasarawa and the FCT, residents are frustrated due to the price increase of staple food items. A trader in Kubwa Market, Dini Suleiman, said a bag of beans previously sold for N27,000 was now sold for N49,000. Suleiman said a bag of Nigerian Rice previously sold for between N15,000 and N20,000 presently sold for N29,000 while a bag of foreign Rice that was sold for N25,000 now goes for N34,000. A bag of yellow garri that was sold for N8,000 presently goes for N22,000 while white garri that was sold for N6,000 presently sold for N17,000. Suleiman said a bag of corn previously sold for N6,000 now goes for N20,000. He attributed the increase in food prices to the cost of transportation, which he said had affected his purchasing power, hence the increase in food prices. POLL Mrs Ofonbuk Okon in Garki market said that a 25 liters of palm oil that was sold for N7,000 was presently sold for N24,000 while 25 liters of groundnut oil that was sold for N12,000 now sold N32,000. She said that four liters of palm oil goes for N7,200 as against N3,200 while four liters of groundnut oil goes for between N5,500 to N10,000 depending on the product. Another trader, Miss Blessing Anthony in Garki market, said palm oil that was sold for N10,000 now goes for N25,000 while groundnut oil that was sold for N15,500 now goes for N32,000, depending on the products. She said that each time she goes to the market to restore her shop, it is usually frustrating because of the rate at which food items are increasing. A garri seller in Wuse market, Mrs Ifeoma Udon, said a bag of yellow garri that was sold for N8,000, presently sold for N22,000 while white garri that was sold for N6,000, presently sold for N17,000 Udon said palm oil that was sold for N7,000, presently sold for N24,000 while groundnut oil that was sold for N12,000, now sold for N32,000. Mr Abubakar Musa, rice seller at Mararaba market, Nasarawa state said the price for foreign rice and local rice had increased, forcing most people to opt for local rice. Musa said that a mudu of foreign rice goes for N1,500, while the local rice goes for N900 as against N1,000 and N600 as at February this year. Musa added that a bag of foreign rice previously sold for N32, 000 was presently being sold for N48, 000, adding that in some cases, bags of rice are being shortened which resulted in losses of profit. He, however, attributed the increase in prices of grains to the high cost of transportation and the security challenges in the country. Mrs Janet Ibrahim, who sells maize at Aso Pada market, Nasarawa state, said that the price of maize per mudu was now N400 as against its former price of N150. She said that a bag of maize now goes for N25,000 as against N15,000 and N10,000 respectively as at few months ago. Ibrahim attributed the increase in prices to the onset of the planting and rainy season. Last week, the newspaper reported that over 40 bakeries have shutdown in the FCT as result of high cost production, chiefly occasioned by high taxes and poor source of energy and power. Those conditions may not abate soon as result of lingering fuel scarcity which has worsened within the week. In some parts of the country like Abuja, motorists buy petrol between N300 and N350-litre in Abuja as at mid-week. Some Abuja residents lamented the spike in the price of PMS as well as the difficulties experienced in accessing the product. A motorist, who gave his name as Adeniji Adebanjo said black marketers were selling fuel between N300 to N350 as of Monday. “I’ve been buying from black marketers’ between N300 to N350 per litre. There is no fuel in most filling stations in Abuja. The ones that have, there’s a very long queue. Since, I don’t have the time to wait, I often resort to the black market,” he said. Aneifiong Edet he was able to buy the product for N250 at a filling station over the weekend but that the difficulty was in accessing. As a result, he was forced to buy at N300 per litre at the black market. “I bought for N250 on Saturday. I had to join a very long queue before I could even get it that day. Today, it was even more difficult. The queues are something else. So I decided to buy black market today. I bought it for N300 per litre.” In Abuja, Khalif filling station in Kubwa, had dispensed the commodity at N250/litre on Sunday but had N165/litre displayed on its pumps. But once a motorist tells the fuel attendant the amount he or she wishes to buy, this would be calculated based on black market rate. The queues for petrol in Abuja has never ceased since February this year, but it grew worse in neighbouring states of Nasarawa, and Niger on Sunday as motorists search for PMS to use to move around during the Sallah break. Oil marketers denied claims of products’ hoarding or diversion, as they stressed that the insufficient supply of PMS by NNPC and the non-payment of bridging claims for the transportation of petrol were the key reasons for the scarcity. Billy Gillis-Harry,the President, Petroleum Products Retail Outlets owners Association of Nigeria, told our correspondent that filling stations that had products were dispensing, while those that were shut had no petrol to sell. It was observed that more filling stations on the Kubwa-Zuba road, Airport Road, Central Business District, among other locations in Abuja had reduced queues on Monday. Retail outlets such as AY Shafa in Deidei, NNPC mega station along Kubwa-Zuba road, Major Oil on Airport Road, and many others dispensed petrol to motorists.
