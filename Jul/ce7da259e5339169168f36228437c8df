LAFIA – Abdullahi Sule, the governor of Nasarawa State on Tuesday cleared the air on some of the projects he initiated and completed in the state and has been criticized by the opposition political parties. The opposition parties are saying he did nothing but complete the projects of his predecessors in his three years in office. Speaking at the Government House in Lafia on Tuesday while playing host to members of the Correspondents chapel of the Nigerian Union of Journalist, Sule said, “The kilema road project was initiated by my administration but I am surprised that some people are saying that the project was 80 per cent done by the previous administration. “We started the kilema road from zero to the end. We are they ones who awarded the contract and somebody will tell you thatwe are completing my predessesor’s project. We are concentrating on the area that would give the state more revenue . “Project like Lafia bus terminal, Mararaba udege road just to mention but few, are projects we started from zero to the end. “If you talk of the Airport project, we inherited it, but we started other projects and have completed them. These projects are scattered across the 13 Local Government Areas of the state. The governor further noted that his administration will not spend billions of naira on projects that will not generate revenue to the state. “Thank God we have a president that can listen to our requests. We have pleaded with him to come and take over the airport. -Advertisement- POLL “Initially, it was a Cargo airport but we have turned it to a place where security agencies can use it for their work and other commercial purpose”, the governor added.
