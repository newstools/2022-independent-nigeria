Dropping an update on the transfer situation of Jules Kounde Cristobal Soria has claimed that ‘absolutely nobody’ from Barcelona have contacted Sevilla to explore a deal for Jules Kounde. The former Sevilla CF field delegate, who is now a collaborator with El Chiringuito, has stated that Barça are yet to make any approach to Sevilla to sign Kounde this summer. The 23-year-old French starlet has become one of Xavi Hernandez’s top transfer targets this summer. Having signed Raphinha and Robert Lewandowski, the Blaugrana have made the signing of the Sevilla ace their next priority for the summer. Recent reports have indicated that the Catalans have already agreed personal terms with the former Bordeaux starlet. They are also understood to be planning a player-plus-cash deal for Kounde, with youngsters like Ez Abde and Nico Gonzalez likely to be used as makeweights. Despite all these suggestions, if the update from Cristobal Soria is to be believed, there does not seem to be any form of communication between Barcelona and Sevilla over a transfer for Kounde, something that Los Nervionenses director Monchi had recently stated as well. “To date, absolutely no one from FC Barcelona has contacted Sevilla FC to ask about Kounde…I repeat…NOBODY…ABSOLUTELY NOBODY from Barça has approached Sevilla about this player,” Soria wrote on Twitter. This update comes only hours after reports emerged that Chelsea had rekindled their interest and were already very close to signing the French international. Despite the claims, several other sources continue to indicate that Kounde will be joining Barcelona this summer. It remains to be seen how this transfer story evolves in the coming weeks.
