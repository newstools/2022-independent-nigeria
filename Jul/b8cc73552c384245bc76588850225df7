Finally, the presidential candidate of the Labour Party (LP) and former Governor of Anambra State, Peter Obi on Wednesday opened up on his choice of running mate for the 2023 presidential election. Peter Obi who spoke on Arise Television’s Morning Show said that he preferred a younger person as his vice-presidential candidate, adding that a younger person who has something to offer to complement his ticket rather than recycling old hands who had been in the government before now. When asked to clarify social media rumours that he had picked the Director of Publicity and Advocacy of Northern Elders Forum, Dr Baba-Ahmed, as his vice-presidential candidate, Obi noted that though consultations are ongoing, he was yet to pick a running mate. He said, “We’re talking to a quiet number of people and Hakeem Baba-Ahmed is a capable hand. But I wish I can work with somebody who is younger. “I prefer younger people who have a lot to offer rather than recycling old hands. I want a competent person and I am building a formidable team. “I want people who can look me in the eye and disagree with me during cabinet meetings. People who have their own minds and ideas.
