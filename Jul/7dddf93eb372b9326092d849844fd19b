Following the crashing of the Nigerian electricity grid, the entire country has been thrown into a blackout again. The grid reportedly crashed to zero megawatts on Wednesday after it developed a fault. The grid went blank for the fifth time in 2022 at about 12 noon on Wednesday. The Eko Electricity Distribution Company disclosed this in a text message forwarded to its customers. The text reads, “Dear customers, we regret to inform you of a system collapse on the national grid at precisely 11:27 am today, Wednesday, July 20. “We are in talks with the Transmission Company of Nigeria to ascertain the cause of the collapse and a possible restoration timeline”.
