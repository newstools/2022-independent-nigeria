Birthdays are always a thing of joy, especially for the celebrators who always wallow and revel in unquantifiable ecstasy and celebration on their day of joy. So it was for charming and irresistibly shade, one of the priceless jewels and daughters of billionaire Globacom boss, Otunba Mike Adenuga Jnr. Vivacious and equally enterprising, Folasade Adenuga added a year days back and it was an opportunity for the birthday girl and her folks to clink glasses and have some munchies together in an atmosphere of convivial and jollity. The birthday was full of thanksgiving to God for attaining the new age. The young lady, Sade is a lawyer and currently serving as the Group Executive Director of MA Group and founder of QuickLaw. Sade has managed million-dollar international partnerships, multi-million-naira property portfolios and various service contracts and special projects within Fintech, Customer Care, Business Development and Marketing. She is the obvious darling of the house and has always been recognised to be as charming as her father and beautiful as her mother, Titi Adenuga, and a bestie of her sister, Bella Adenuga-Disu. She graduated with honours from a UK university with a law degree; Sade inherited more than just charm and beauty from her celebrated parents. The gift of industry, management and administration might be part of the ensemble in the Adenuga blood that Sade has added to her own innate talents and gifts.
