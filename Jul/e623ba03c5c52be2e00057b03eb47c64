It’s rather unfortunate. “I am just on my lane o working very hard to sustain my brand. I have no time to beef anyone because the sky is so wide for all of us to fly.. Currently I am working on my next album which will be richer than the first. I have been sampling the tracks at live shows and the reception is great.
