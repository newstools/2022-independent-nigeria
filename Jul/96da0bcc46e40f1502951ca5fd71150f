IBADAN – Muslim faithfuls in Oyo State and Nigeria have been urged to imbibe the spirit of tolerance and religious harmony as the country marks the Eid el Kabir festival. This call was made by Hon. Idris Abiola-Ajimobi on Friday in the Eid el Kabir message issued by Lateef Alade his media aide, to Muslim faithful in Oyo state and across Nigeria. He urged the faithful to reflect on the essence of the festival, which he described as the a time for renewal of our obedience and commitment to peace. The Aare Akogun Muslumi who’s currently on Holy pilgrimage said the Eid-el-Kabir festival signifies an opportunity for Muslim to reflect on the faith, with which Ibrahim (Abraham) willingly agreed to sacrifice his only son and let go of his prized asset, just in obedience to the command of Allah (SWT), he said. He implored Muslim faithful to lay aside all forms of religious, ethnic and tribal sentiments, “in the interest of unity, peace, progress and prosperity of the state and country.” The Aare Akogun muslumi also urged Nigerians to fervently pray for the prosperity of the state and the nation and eschew acts capable of denying them the blessings of Allah (SWT).
