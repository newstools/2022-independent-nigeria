LAGOS – The African Action Congress (AAC) has said that it has successfully completed the process of uploading particulars and sworn affidavits of its candidates, vying for all positions. A statement by the party’s National Publicly Secretary, Femi Adeyeye on Friday night indicated that the action was in line with the timeline and regulations of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC ). The party stated that the materials included those of candidates from the presidential to Houses of Assembly, in the forthcoming general elections. It said: “Within the shortest period since our party was rescued from government-sponsored usurpers, we have been able to mobilise candidates in their hundreds to contest in the forthcoming elections. “From Kano, to Katsina, Nassarawa to Delta, Benue to Edo, Lagos to Rivers, across all states of the federation, the Nigerian masses have been afforded the opportunity of an alternative; a distinct alternative to the rotten ruling class parties and their appendages that are mere borrowed tents. “We urge INEC to do the needful as it concerns publishing names of candidates, as at when due. “We wish to restate the AAC is the party to beat in the 2023 elections. Viva AAC! Viva Nigeria!”
