Tyrell Malacia has been confirmed as Manchester United’s first summer signing, joining from Feyenoord. The Netherlands international has signed a contract until June 2026, with the option to extend for a further year. He becomes Erik ten Hag’s first signing since taking over as manager, with the arrival of Christian Eriksen also believed to be close. Malacia played 136 times for Feyenoord and has earned five senior Dutch caps to date. The left-back will come in and primarily provide back-up to Luke Shaw, but his arrival could also force the departure of Alex Telles and Brandon Williams. Speaking to the club’s website, Malacia said: “It’s an incredible feeling to have joined Manchester United. This is a new chapter for me, a new league with new team-mates and a tremendous manager leading us. “I know from playing against his teams in the Eredivisie, the qualities that he has and what he demands of his players. “Whilst I know that I am still young and will continue to develop, I can promise the United fans that I will leave everything on the pitch every time I pull on the red shirt. -Advertisement- POLL “I’ll always be thankful to Feyenoord for all they have given to me and my family,” he added. “None of this would be possible if it wasn’t for them. Now I’m ready to focus on the future with United, and help my new club achieve success.” John Murtough, United’s football director added: “Tyrell is an exciting, dynamic young footballer with excellent experience for his age, including five seasons in the Eredivisie, a European final and full international honours for the Netherlands. “We look forward to seeing him continue to develop under the guidance of Erik ten Hag and his coaching team in the years ahead. Everyone at Manchester United welcomes Tyrell to the club.”
