ABUJA – The presidency has debunked a report allegedly from the Department of State Services advising President Muhammadu Buhari on the likelihood of crisis in the future over the All Progressive Congress presidential flagbearer, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu running on a Muslim-Muslim ticket. Senior Special Assistant on Media and Publicity to the President, Garba Shehu debunked the information in a terse statement on Friday. He said, “We wish to advise well-meaning Nigerians to ignore a laughably puerile report by an apparently pirate online newspaper seeking to sow division and chaos on the choice of Governor Kashim Shettima as the Running Mate of our Party’s Presidential Candidate, Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu. “This so-called newspaper is like a deadly virus. Stay safe by keeping away from its toxic reports”. Recall that a report from an online newspaper had claimed that the All Progressives Congress (APC) presidential candidate, Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu’s decision to nominate a fellow Muslim as vice-presidential candidate for 2023 presidential election was a recipe for renewed sectarian crises that could destabilise Nigeria, an intelligence report by the Department of State Service (DSS) has revealed. The classified report was allegedly sent to President Muhammadu Buhari by the State Security Service and shared with an online newspaper, Peoples Gazette, by national security officials this week. The report also claimed that the document, which got to the president by way of the National Security Adviser (NSA), Gen. Babagana Monguno (rtd), said Tinubu should consider the security implications of his selection before making it public.
