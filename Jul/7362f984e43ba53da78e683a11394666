AWKA – The traditional ruler of Nawfia community in Njikoka local government area of Anambra state His Royal Highness Igwe Chijioke Nwankwo has stated that the state governor Prof. Charles Chukwuma Soludo needs ample time to clean up a lot of mess in Anambra state. Igwe Chijioke Nwankwo who stated this during an exclusive interview with our correspondent in his palace at Nawfia, maintained that it would be a joke of the century for anyone to assess the governor within 100 days in office because according to him, Soludo has a lot of things to fix in Anambra state and that one year may not be enough to assess him let alone 100 days. The traditional ruler said, ” I His Royal Highness Igwe Chijioke Nwankwo said when you meet a house that is not clean, you don’t expect anybody to move in. Therefore this government has a lot of clean up to do before you expect anything from them. As I was informed, a minimum of over one hundred towns are having troubles with divide and rule. To clean that mess up is not easy. This is something that was done over 8 years. I don’t think anybody should expect anything from this government in hundred days. The person will be a joker. They are still new and there is nothing to assess. They are just beginning to clean up the mess they met on ground. Insecurity has gotten worse all over the nation especially Northeast. Soludo should be given time and space to do the things he said he will do. His cabinet members are well educated personnel. They should be given time to work things out for Ndi-Anambra. He needs time to fix a lot of mess he inherited. “
