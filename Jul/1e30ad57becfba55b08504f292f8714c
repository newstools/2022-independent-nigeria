Barcelona are unable to register new signings Franck Kessie and Andreas Christensen to play despite completing the impressive double swoop. Both Kessie, 25, and Christensen, 26, have penned four-year deals at the Camp Nou after running down their contracts at AC Milan and Chelsea respectively. The duo are expected to form a key part of Xavi’s side next season as La Blaugrana try to wrestle back the title from El Clasico rivals Real Madrid. Yet, despite their official announcements, neither Kessie nor Christensen are actually permitted to turn out for the first-team, as the Catalan giants are still way above La Liga’s salary cap. According to Spanish outlet Cope, Barcelona are unable to register the Ivorian midfielder and the Danish defender as they are still waiting for Manchester United to finalise a deal for Frenkie de Jong. United have an initial £56million agreement in place for the Dutch playmaker but De Jong is yet to finalise personal terms. The 25-year-old had previously informed club chiefs of his intention to stay in Catalunya but Barca’s worrying financial situation has forced him out the exit door. The Netherlands international is also in line for a bumper salary increase if he enters the fourth year of his Barca contract, which is why the Catalonians are desperate to flog their highest earner in the transfer window. As well as the additions of Kessie and Christensen, Xavi is hopeful of acquiring Bayern Munich marksman Robert Lewandowski and Leeds United ace Raphinha, but all incomings will need to be rubber-stamped by La Liga. The departures of Ousmane Dembele, Philippe Coutinho and Dani Alves have balanced the books to some extent but Xavi’s purse strings are tight and Barca are banking that the £70m deal for De Jong will be enough to fund their summer business.
