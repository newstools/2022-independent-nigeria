Prof. Itse Sagay (SAN) on Monday said there was nothing wrong in Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, presidential candidate of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) flying a Muslim-Muslim ticket if it will enhance his victory in the 2023 Presidential election. Tinubu, a Muslim and former Lagos state governor had announced former Borno State governor, Kashim Shetimma, another Muslim as his running mate, a decision that has sparked widespread criticism especially from the Christian community in the country. Speaking in an interview with DAILY INDEPENDENT, Sagay who is the Chairman of the Presidential Advisory Committee Against Corruption (PACAC) said religion shouldn’t be a factor when a candidate is looking for a running mate that can enhance his victory in an election. He said “My attitude to it is a very practical one. You are in an election to win the election. Pick the candidate that will enhance your victory, regardless of his religion”. “If a candidate is in an election and he is serious about winning, he should do a detailed analysis. Any person that will enhance his victory, that is the person he should select as running mate”. When asked if the North can accept a Christian- Christian ticket in the future, Sagay who is also a chieftain of the ruling party said   “That is an interesting question. It is a question of social level of development. I think we in the South are sufficiently socially developed to accept the practical outcomes in the electoral process without bothering what religion the person comes from”. “So, if the northerners will not normally accept that, that should not be a measurement of our own response to the situation. It means the South is more socially developed”.
