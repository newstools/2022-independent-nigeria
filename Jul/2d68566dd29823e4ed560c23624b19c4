Primate Elijah Ayodele, leader of INRI Evangelical Spiritual Church on Saturday revealed how the presidential candidate of the People’s Democratic Party (PDP), Atiku Abubakar will pave way for Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, presidential candidate of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC)’s victory in the 2023 general elections. Primate Ayodele who gave this revelation while addressing journalists in Lagos said Atiku will win the 2023 presidential election but if PDP fail to strategize properly, they would hand over the 2023 presidential victory to Tinubu. The clergyman, however, warned that Atiku, Tinubu, and the Labour Party (LP), presidential candidate, Peter Obi can’t resolve Nigeria’s problems, adding that Tinubu can only win the forthcoming presidential election through rigging. He said, “Not Atiku or Peter Obi can make Nigeria any better; I have not seen any fantastic candidate that can turn Nigeria around. But one person must be there no matter the situation. “Tinubu and APC can only win by rigging, I don’t hate him, but I’m speaking as the prophet of God. If Tinubu becomes president, Nigeria will be worst than Buhari’s government; Nigeria will be stagnant, a failed nation, a disgraced nation. “Tinubu will become a pandemic, disaster, calamity on Nigeria; mind you, I don’t hate him, but I’m speaking as a prophet of God. “The election is for PDP, but if they fail to restrategize properly, then they will give it to Tinubu.”
