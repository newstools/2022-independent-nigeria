Russian President Vladimir Putin has signed a decree that allows Ukrainians in all parts of the country to obtain Russian citizenship, compounding concerns about the aims of Russia’s war against its neighbour. The decree signed on July 11 says all Ukrainian citizens and persons without citizenship residing in Ukraine can get Russian passports through the same simplified procedure that Moscow introduced in 2019 for residents of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions, parts of which have been controlled by Kremlin-backed separatists since 2014. Since May 25 of this year, it has also applied to residents of two Ukrainian regions, Kherson and Zaporizhzhya, parts of which have been occupied during Moscow’s unprovoked invasion launched in February. It now applies throughout Ukraine. The expansion “means [that Russia’s] plans for occupation have no geographical limits,” Maria Zolkina, head of regional security and conflict studies at the Kyiv-based Democratic Initiatives Foundation think tank, wrote on Twitter. Putin and other Russian officials have insisted that the invasion’s goal was not to occupy Ukraine. However, Moscow and Russian-imposed authorities in occupied Ukrainian territories now say the regions could become part of Russia. Russian-installed authorities in occupied territories of Ukraine’s Kherson and Zaporizhzhya regions said earlier that they had set up passport-issuance centers for Ukrainian citizens who chose to obtain Russian passports. In the Luhansk and Donetsk regions, known collectively as the Donbas, separatist leaders said earlier that hundreds of thousands of local residents had obtained Russian citizenship since 2019.
