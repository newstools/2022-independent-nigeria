As the 2023 general elections draw closer, former presidential candidate and political economist, Prof. Pat Utomi on Wednesday revealed why elections in Nigeria are based on rigging. Utomi who spoke on Channels TV’s Politics Today revealed that Nigeria’s elections are based on rigging due to the fact that some government officials steal from the treasury and use the same to run political parties. Utomi while speaking on the programme noted that many politicians used public funds to run major political parties, adding that those who don’t have access to the treasury settled for small parties. Utomi who stepped down for Peter Obi to clinch the Labour Party (LP) presidential ticket in the forthcoming general elections, however, said with the party things were drastically changing. According to him, the two leading political parties, the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) and People’s Democratic Party (PDP) had failed Nigerians, saying the Labour Party is out to redeem the damage. he said, “I was there at the founding of the PDP and I understand that it would not take Nigeria where it should go. I was there at the founding of APC and I saw a disaster in the making and I began to think. “Examining things, I came to the simple conclusion; in structural economics, there is a paradigm called the structure-conduct-performance paradigm. “Structure usually affects conduct; the behaviour of the players within that space. Depending on how weak or strong the institutions are, the result and outcome. It’s clear to me that the nature of the structure of PDP and APC is based on the transaction; you give and take.”
