ABUJA – The Chief of the Air Staff (CAS), Air Marshal Oladayo Amao has said that with Nigerian Air Force (NAF) personnel actively engaged in various operational theatres across the country, it is important that they maintain a high standard of physical and mental fitness. The Airforce boss stated this on Saturday, at the 2022 Second Quarter Route March Exercise for NAF personnel in Abuja. The Route March, which is routine, according to Air Commodore Edward Gabkwet, Director of Public Relations and Information, Nigerian Air Force in a statement to newsmen “is part of the efforts aimed at continually promoting comradeship and esprit de corps among personnel as well as physical and combat fitness with a view to enhancing NAF operational readiness. According to Air Marshal Amao, “Route march is a military tradition practised worldwide and aims at ensuring NAF officers, airmen and civilian staff are physically fit in order to handle the rigours and stress associated with their daily tasks and responsibilities.” Speaking further, the CAS reiterated the need for personnel to continue to be vigilant and security conscious, while remaining apolitical, even as the Nation gradually approaches another election year. “While I encourage you all to exercise your franchise, please be guided by the ethics and discipline that has been inculcated in you. You must also continue to foster peace and be law-abiding even as you carry out your civic duties.” Air Marshal Amao, who led the route march, went on to state that in addition to the weekly sporting activities held in all NAF units, the NAF Sports Week has been planned for the Third Quarter of 2022 so as to promote peaceful coexistence amongst personnel and families as well as serve as an avenue for discovering new NAF talents for the upcoming 2022 Armed Forces of Nigeria Games. He also stated that the Games would give the NAF an opportunity to engage the large Base Youths population rather than them engaging in the rampaging vices in the society. -Advertisement- POLL While congratulating participants on a successful exercise, Air Marshal Amao expressed the profound gratitude of the NAF to the President and Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces, President Muhammadu Buhari, for his unflinching support to the growth and development of the NAF.
