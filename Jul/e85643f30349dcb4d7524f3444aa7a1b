Preparatory to the 2022 batch ‘B’ Stream II NYSC Orientation course, the Yobe State camp officials on Wednesday met to brainstorm on strategies to ensure the success of the exercise. The meeting is sequel to the commendation for their commitment to the execution of the goals of the orientation course as demonstrated during the 2022 Batch ‘B’ Stream I orientation course. This was the submission of the NYSC State Coordinator, Mrs Hafsat Yerima during the 2022 Batch ‘B’ Stream II Orientation Course camp officials’ meeting held at the NYSC Orientation Camp Dazigau. The Coordinator was quick to remind the camp officials that every orientation course has its peculiarities and challenges as such all hands must be on deck to deliver seamlessly the aims and objectives of the exercise. Mrs Yerima, therefore, cautioned against the use of illicit drugs, socialization and indiscipline as these behaviours are inimical to the goals of the orientation course. She appealed to all to cooperate for the success of the programme. Yerima also enjoined camp officials to warmly welcome the corps members as a way of endangering the hospitable environment. It was generally agreed that all will work towards a peaceful orientation exercise.
