The political turf in the gateway state is getting more melodramatic and one of those making the stage very interesting to watch is the unrepentant and indefatigable PDP 2023 gubernatorial hopeful, Hon. Ladi, the son of the richest and most famous philanthropist, Adetokunbo Adebutu Kessington. Now, the famous Baba Ijebu’s politically active son, Hon. Ladi is the man of the moment in the Gateway State of Ogun, and he is gathering massive momentum in the political circles, just as all the caucuses in his party are rallying for him. With his mounting followership across all boards, Lado as he’s fondly called appears to be taking the shine away from other equally credible aspirants in other parties. The latest big fish in Adebutu’s political magnetic net; is Hon. Adekunle Akinlade, who has now switched his political allegiance from APC to a new party, and ultimately clinched the running mate rung of Ladi Adebutu. Akinlade, the former House of Representatives member maintained that he could not in good conscience continue to participate in a process that is characterised by injustice. Adekunle fondly called ‘Triple A’ recently bid goodbye to the All Progressives Congress (APC) over the failure of the national leadership of the party to settle the rift within the party in Ogun. With the coming together of Akinlade and Ladi Adebutu, the hitherto bumpy road to the Oke Mosan Government House appears to be gradually smoothening up for the duo in their renewed quest for the governorship of the gateway state.
