A Senior Advocate of Nigeria (SAN), Mr Ebun-Olu Adegoruwa has described the Muslim -Muslim ticket by the All Progressives Congress (APC) as a terrible choice. Adegoruwa in a statement issued on Sunday said the latest move by the party’s presidential candidate, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu is insensitive and a wrong choice in one million ways. He said: “Nigerians, whether Muslims, Christians, Traditionalists, etc, should reject APC with their votes come 2023. A Muslim-Muslim ticket in present-day Nigeria is fuel for Boko Haram, the incentive for ISWAP and a call for more terrorists. Unless of course, those parading the ticket are themselves complicit. He added that there is no better way to insult our sensibilities. I pray it is not true.”
