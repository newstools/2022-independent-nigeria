A chieftain of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), Alhaji Kabiru Sani Giant has said that there is nothing wrong with the single faith agreed upon by the presidential candidate of the party, Ahmed Bola Tinubu in the 2023 general elections. Speaking exclusively to daily independent on Monday, Giant said that the bulk of northern votes comes from the northwest and northeast so if the southwest wants to produce the next president they need such votes to win adding that, if the west fails to bring somebody from the north which is a Muslims APC cannot win elections because people from the region will shun the ruling party. He said, “as far as I am concerned, Tinubu made a wise choice there is nothing wrong with it, Shettima is a polished and popular politician in the north so he will work for the success of the party at the polls. On the possibility of Nigerian Christians embracing the same faith ticket he said Christians are not fair to Muslims because Muslims have not been speaking out on dominance politically, he cited the west as an example saying in the entire western states there is only one Muslim governor the rest are Christians with all there deputies but the Muslims didnt raise alarm. In the north too there are about 9 Christian governors with Christian deputies still no complaints from the Muslims ” so CAN should sheath their sword lets strive to reposition the country and rise above religion and ethnicity”. Giant who dismissed Senator Alieru and the former Senate leader’s defection to the opposition People’s Democratic Party (PDP) has no threat said that cross carpeting is a normal thing in politics others too very soon from PDP will defect to APC in Kebbi to fill the vacant positions, therefor Tinubu is already coasting to victory.
