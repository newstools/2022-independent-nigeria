The presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Atiku Abubakar has been described as the unifier needed at this time of our nation’s history. Engr. Jide Adeniji, former chairman, Federal Road Maintenance Agency (FERMA), made this known during the unveiling of a new group logo for the PDP presidential candidate, Atiku Abubakar. The logo was rolled out by the Partnership for Atiku 2023, a leading Atiku’s support group on Sunday in Abuja, the nation’s capital. The unveiling was performed by the daughter of the PDP presidential candidate, Mariam Abubakar Atiku. In her brief speech, Ms Atiku thanked the group for all their efforts towards ensuring that her father is elected, promised to give listening ears whenever her support is needed. In his goodwill message, Mr Adeniji, who is the Secretary of the Atiku Campaign Organisation described Atiku as a Nigerian personified, adding that “the only person that can unite us is Atiku Abubakar. “Atiku is a household name, unifier, not a religious bigot, who is in the best position to unify the country,” Adeniji added. In his welcome address, the national coordinator of the group, Prince Adebisi Moses Gbadegesin recalled that the group has been identified with the presidential aspiration of the former vice president since 2003, adding that 2023 has been destined for Alhaji Atiku to become the Nigeria’s president. To realise this, Mr Gbadegesin said his group has resolved to go round the nook and cranny of the country to mobilise Nigerians to vote for Atiku Abubakar, during the 2023 general elections, most especially the Southwest where he (Gbadegesin) hails from.
