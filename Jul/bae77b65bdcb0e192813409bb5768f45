After multiple postponements, Andrea Cambiaso finally arrived in Turin to take the medicals and finalize his move to Juventus. Genoa and the Bianconeri have convinced Radu Dragusin to move to Serie B despite his initial reservations. According to Goal, the Old Lady will acquire their new fullback for €4M plus the Romanian center-back, who spent last season at Sampdoria and Salernitana. He will be valued around €3M. Cambiaso will complete his steady rise through the Italian football pyramid with the transfer to Juventus. However, he is unlikely to be part of the 2022/2023 squad, TuttoSport relays. Bologna and Salernitana asked for him on loan. He could wind up replacing Aaron Hickey and perhaps facilitating the addition of Marko Arnautovic. The Austrian marksman is one of the top candidates to deputize Dusan Vlahovic. The 22-year-old newcomer was in Serie D as late as the 2018/2019 season. Genoa loaned him to Alessandria and Empoli in the following two campaigns. Davide Ballardini gave him a chance last summer, and he showed out, scoring once and providing 4 assists in 26 appearances. A knee injury sidelined in the final months, preventing him from further padding his stats. Despite being left-footed, he can feature on the right flank too.
