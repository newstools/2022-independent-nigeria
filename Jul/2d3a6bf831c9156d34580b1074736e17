 KANO – For the umpteenth time, the Independent Electoral Com­mission (INEC) on Thursday in Kano declared that the com­mission would prosecute any­one found to engage in double registration for voter cards. Professor Risqua Arabu Shehu, Kano State Resident Electoral Commissioner, told reporters that incidence of double registration were on the rise across the federation, as he stressed that the com­mission would apply the full weight of the law to check­mate the tide. Shehu explained that, “double registration is an of­fence as clearly enshrined in the Electoral Act 2022, but un­fortunately, we have observed that many of the people who show up for the registration already have their Perma­nent Voter Cards (PVCs). He disclosed that, “as at January 2022, about 40% of those who registered in Kano State were found to have reg­istered before, this scenario is in all the states of the fed­eration.” The Resident Electoral Commissioners stated that, ” We have been trying to educate people to understand that the PVCs issued by the commis­sion do not expire, therefore, there is no need for anybody with PVC to register again.” Shehu called on relevant authorities to establish the Electoral Offences Tribunal to handle violations of the Electoral Act. However, Shehu said the commission would continue to encourage those who reg­istered to collect their PVC, adding that there were over 380,000 uncollected old PVCs in Kano. -Advertisement- POLL He said, “There are also 77,117 new PVCs of those who registered in the first and second quarters (June – December 2021) of the CVR, and distribution has com­menced since.”
