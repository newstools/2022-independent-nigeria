Moody Rating Agency has stated that the Council of the European Union (EU) and European Parliament have reached a provisional agreement on proposals to regulate EU markets in crypto assets (MiCA), including stablecoin and unbacked crypto asset issuers,1 trading venues and wallets, and to introduce consumer protection measures and standards for stablecoins. It said: “pending formal agreement by the Council and European Parliament, the regulations are likely to take effect within 18 months. The measures are credit positive. Greater oversight of stablecoin structures and liquidity requirements will likely stabilise and increase use of digital currency payments systems, and encourage technology innovation in the EU. The EU regulations are the first of their kind, with the US and the UK in the process of formalising specific rules2. “The overarching aim of MiCA is to provide greater investor protections to what has so far been a risky and volatile asset class. There will also be a EUR200 million cap on the volume of transactions per stablecoin. “The regulations would help to address current gaps, aiming to prevent market abuse, fraudulent schemes and insider trading. Under the proposed rules, the European Banking Authority (EBA) will regulate EU-issued stablecoins. “Issuers will be required to build reserves at a 1-to-1 ratio, including deposits, and will be subject to minimum liquidity requirements. Wallet protections will also make crypto asset service providers liable if they lose investors’ crypto assets due to hacks or operational failures that could have been prevented.
