P/HARCOURT – As a way of empowering the people and creating employment opportunities to cushion the harsh effect of the present economic realities, the National Directorate of Employment (NDE), has commenced a five-day training of 50 farmers on Small Stock Goat Production in Rivers State. Inaugurating the training in Port Harcourt, Director-General, NDE, Mallam Nuhu Fikpo, who was represented by the Director, Rural Employment Promotion (REP), Mr. Edem Duke, said the Federal Government was anxious to roll out more agricultural programmes to enhance food security in the country. Noting that Rivers State was one of the 18 states that were chosen for the five-day training, Fikpo said the programme had an empowerment component, adding, “we are going to train 50 people, but will resettle those who are serious with the training. “We believe that at the end of this programme, you will be able to take your destiny in your own hands and start a new life for your good and that of your environment. “We have a model revolving loan seed. We are going to empower you through the model revolving where you will be given two goats, one male and one female. “You will pay in kind by giving back a kid reproduced by the goats after three months which we will put together to settle other trainees that will be coming after you. “We will also teach you how to know the types of breed to train, so that you will make choice of the breed you want after training,” he said. Fikpo commended NDE in Rivers State for carrying the Federal and State Ministry of Agriculture along in its programmes. -Advertisement- POLL Earlier in her speech, the Rivers State Coordinator of the directorate, Mrs Maureen Okeji, said: “agriculture has taken over the test of time globally as the world works seriously towards food security.”
