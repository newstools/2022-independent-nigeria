ABAKALIKI – Honourable Joseph Nwobashi, candidate of the All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA) for Ezza North/Ishielu federal constituency in the 2023 general elections, has dispelled the rumour making the rounds that he had withdrawn from the race. Nwobashi, who was a former Majority Leader in the Ebonyi State House of Assembly spoke to journalists on Tuesday. He said he had no plans to withdraw for someone as being speculated in some quarters and called in his supporters to remain calm and law-abiding. He, however, acknowledged that he was being approached to step down for another person from the constituency, but noted he had no intention to do so. He called on the Independent National Electoral Commission and other relevant agencies to note that he never withdrew from the race. Nwobashi said: “The primary election for House of Representatives in APGA was conducted on 27th May 2022 in Ebonyi State and I won the ticket to represent Ezza North/Ishielu federal constituency. “Our names were sent to the national secretariat of our party after the primaries and certificates of returns have been issued to all of us that won in Ebonyi State. “Recently, I have been approached by some persons to step down for someone. But I want to make it publicly clear that I have not stepped down for anyone and have no intention to step down for anyone. POLL “I want to assure my supporters to remain calm and law-abiding, that my ticket is intact and I’m fully in the race. “So, I want to notify the INEC and other relevant agencies to take note, that should there be any notice to them that I have withdrawn, they should disregard it.” On the allegation that he agreed to withdraw for someone else, he said, “There is no time I agreed to step down for anybody.”
