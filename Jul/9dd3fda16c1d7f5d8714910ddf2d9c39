Popular Nigerian actress and movie producer, Funke Akindele, popularly known as ‘Jenifa’ has revealed why she accepted to be the running mate of the governorship candidate of the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) in Lagos State, Dr Olajide Adediran aka Jandor. Daily Independent had earlier reported that following the announcement of Jandor that he has picked Funke Akindele as his Deputy Governorship candidate, the 44-year-old mother of two has also taken to her Twitter and Instagram page to confirm she is running alongside the PDP candidate. Announcing her preparedness in a video she posted on her verified Instagram handle, the Ikorodu-born indigene of Lagos, said, “I saw it as an opportunity to help liberate and improve the wellbeing of our people, particularly the deprived youth, women and the girl child. “My decision is not just to accept this huge responsibility but to also work tirelessly and complement Jandor’s burning desire to see our dear Lagos live up to its full potential.” Last month, many were shocked when her former husband announced that they had parted ways. Lagos State chapter of PDP had commenced the process for the selection of a running mate for Jandor in line with the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) guidelines on elections. Akindele, from the Ikorodu division, was said to be on top of the list, which comprised other four names as potential running mates for Jandor. Two of the shortlisted candidates – Rhodes-Vivour and Kolawole – are from Lagos West, the same senatorial district as Jandor, hence negatively affecting their chances.
