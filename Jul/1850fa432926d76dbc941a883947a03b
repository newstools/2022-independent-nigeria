Phil Foden will sign a new bumper six-year deal at Manchester City this summer – worth a basic £200,000-a-week. The England playmaker, 22, had been close to putting pen to paper on a £150,000-a-week offer six months ago but opted to wait until the end of the campaign to sort his long-term future. And that delay has paid handsome dividends for City’s homegrown star. Over the next six seasons, the updated version will bag Foden an extra £15m in wages. That puts one of Europe’s brightest rising stars closer to the highest earners at the Etihad. Kevin De Bruyne, for example, picks up the biggest pay packet with the English champions – on £400,000 a week. And that figure is matched by City’s summer acquisition, Erling Haaland. The former Borussia Dortmund striker, 21, who cost £65m, is on the same money. That would have been more than double the amount Foden earned – had the latter signed the original contract on the table last October. Though there was never any chance he might not to extend his stay with Pep Guardiola’s men, Foden wanted to see what the likes of Haaland would be on before committing. The fact City have a lucrative bonus scheme in operation helps take their players’ wages near to the astronomical sums earned by many their Premier League elite counterparts. With those thrown into the equation someone such as Foden could end up earning closer to £250,000-a-week over a season, depending on his and the team’s success. Meanwhile, Spanish midfielder Rodri will see his weekly wages at City soar from £120,000 to £220,000 in an improved extension currently being negotiated. POLL Although he still has two years left on his existing deal at the Etihad, Rodri, 26, is deemed an essential cog in Guardiloa’s midfield and the club are keen to tie his services down. He is likely to have another three years added, keeping the former Atletico Madrid star at the Etihad until June 2027.
