OSOGBO  – A staff of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) and a Nation a Youth Service Corps (NYSC) member recruited as ad hoc staff for the July 16, 2022 governorship election in Osun State have been arrested for allegedly selling Permanent Voter Cards (PVCs). The incident occurred at Ilesa, Osun State. The buyer, a civil servant who was alleged to have been working for the opposition party, was said to be on the run at the press time. The problem occurred when the rightful owner of PVC, whose name was called by the INEC officials for collection on Wednesday, came to claim his card and was told that the card was not ready. The victim and other people with similar experiences staged a protest to inquire into the cause of the conflicting information about the 39 cards already announced the previous day. The INEC staff, who had two more years in service and the ad hoc officer were summoned to Ilesa Area Command by the State Commissioner of Police who was on a special patrol, for questioning. During the interrogation, the ad hoc officer confessed that the suspect approached him to collect the PVCs on behalf of the owners and that he obliged him after offering and receiving a gratification.
