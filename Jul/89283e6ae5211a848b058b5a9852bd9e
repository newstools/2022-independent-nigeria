ABUJA –  The President of the Senate, Ahmad Lawan, has described the recent invasion of the Medium Security Prison in Kuje, as an indictment on security agencies in the federal capital territory. Lawan who was on an inspection tour of the incident told National Assembly Correspondents that the inability of security agencies to, through intelligence gathering, prevent the attack “shows that none of us in Abuja, being the seat of government, is safe.” He also regretted the absence of functional close circuit cameras (CCTV) on the facility, noting that it would have eased the tracking of the attackers. While lamenting that over 300 suspected ISWAP terrorists carried out the dastardly act and only three were killed during a faceoff with the military, he assured that the Upper Chamber will interface with the management of the correctional facility to forestall a recurrence.
