As the 2023 general elections gathered momentum across the country, the African Action Congress (AAC) presidential candidate, Omoyele Sowore on Saturday vowed to probe all past leaders involved in corruption to ensure that all looted funds are recovered if elected president in the forthcoming election. Sowore’s comment is coming barely three hours after the presidential candidate of the Labour Party (LP), Peter Obi said he has no plan to probe any past leader if he succeeds President Muhammadu Buhari in 2023. Reacting to Obi’s comment in a post shared vias his official Twitter page, the publisher of Sahara Reporters said he would retrieve every penny stolen by past Nigerian rulers, those who have murdered innocents and deprived them of a bright future. According to him, if Nigeria could retrieve money from the dead Sanni Abacha, the country can still retrieve it from living legendary thieves. He said: “As President of Nigeria, I will probe and retrieve every penny stolen by past Nigerian rulers, those who have murdered innocents and deprived them of a bright future. “If we could be retrieving money from dead and buried Sanni Abacha, we should retrieve it from living legendary thieves.” Retweeting Sowore’s tweet, the vice-presidential candidate of AAC Haruna Magashi, posted: “There will be no exemptions, all political thieves, past and present will be stripped under our administration. Stolen funds from Nigerians must be taken back.”
