KANO – Following the omission of Muhammad Sani Abacha as Kano State Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) Gubernatorial candidate for next February election, the scion of the Abacha Dynasty, on Friday ordered his lawyers to approach the court of law to reclaim his mandate. Mr Abacha who emerged winner of the Kano PDP governorship primary told this newspaper that he was shocked to discover that his name was substituted with Sadiq Wali when the Independent Electoral Commission (INEC), displayed the list of nationwide candidates for various elective positions for the 2023 poll. The Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC, on Friday, displayed the name of Wali as the gubernatorial candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP in Kano State. In a telephone interview with DAILY INDEPENDENT, the son to late Head of state, General Sani Abacha explained that “What happened today was a complete electoral fraud, you can’t build something on nothing.” He stated that “I don’t expect this to happen with the electoral amendment Act in place. The era of impunity and lawlessness is over in Nigeria. I believe in the supremacy of the law and I have strong confidence that justice shall prevail.” Sounding more offensive, Abacha disclosed that I have asked my lawyers to file a suit on the matter next week. I’m heading to court to reclaim my stolen mandate.” Mr Abacha suffered the same fate in 2011 when he was denied the governorship ticket of the Congress for Progressive Change (CPC) after he defeated Lawan Jafaru Isa during its primary election.
