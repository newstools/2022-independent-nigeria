Popular Kaduna-based Islamic cleric, Sheikh Ahmad Gumi has revealed why the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) and its presidential candidate, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu opt for a Muslim-Muslim ticket which is against popular opinion. Daily Independent had earlier reported that the social media was agog and flooded with reactions following the announcement of the former Borno State Governor, Kashim Shettima, a fellow Muslim as the running mate of Tinubu. Many party members have resigned their membership while some stakeholders have registered their grievances on Tinubu’s decision to pick a fellow Muslim since the announcement was made. However, some party members have argued that there is nothing wrong with the decision, stressing that the only way the party can emerge victorious in 2023 is to have a Muslim vice presidential candidate. Correspondingly, Gumi while reacting to the development in a media chat with daily post said that Tinubu’s choice of running mate has nothing to do with religion. According to him, the Muslim-Muslim ticket was just a strategy to win the election, adding that the electorates, particularly the aggrieved ones, have the right to vote for their preferred candidate. He said, “It has nothing to do with religion. It’s a pure vote-getting strategy and nothing more. It now depends on the voter to choose from a wide range of choices”.
