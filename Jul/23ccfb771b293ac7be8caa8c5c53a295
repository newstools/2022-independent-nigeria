The lawmaker representing Adamawa north senatorial district, Ishaku Abbo has described Bola Tinubu’s decision to pick a Muslim as his running mate as irresponsible. The lawmaker condemned the former Governor of Lagos state for not learning from how President Muhammadu Buhari picked a Christian running mate in 2015 as against the Muslim/Muslim ticket. He further stated, “Buhari fought a civil war and understands the consequences of a divided nation. When Tinubu wanted to be VP in 2015, Buhari said no because he understood the importance of unity.” Abbo disclosed that he met with a support group in Abuja in search of a running mate for Tinubu, adding that the group agreed that Tinubu should not run alongside a Muslim vice. The lawmaker noted, “We sat down in Abuja and strategised, and we concluded that he should not take a Muslim as running mate. He (Tinubu) threw away the report. My conscience will not allow me to campaign for Tinubu. I am a member of CAN; I cannot deny CAN. I remain in APC. But I will take the survival of my country first over political considerations. “We cannot work for such a man. I will oppose (a) Christian-Christian ticket because I am invested in the stability of this country. A Christian-Christian ticket will be insensitive to Muslims of this country. The country is evenly divided between Muslims and Christians. So any government that is Muslim-Muslim will be illegitimate and will never gain the respect of Christians.”
