ABAKALIKI – Ebonyi State Governor David Umahi said he was neither against the presidential aspiration of Mr Peter Obi, the presidential candidate of the Labour Party (LP), nor the quest for Nigeria’s president of Igbo extraction in 2023. Umahi made the clarifications on Friday while reacting to a post making the rounds on social media quoting him as saying that he was against Mr Obi’s presidential aspiration. The post also quoted Umahi as saying that he no longer believes in the struggle for Nigeria’s president of Igbo extraction. But the Governor through a press statement signed by the State Commissioner for Information, Barrister Uchenna Orji, said the post in circulation was authored by political jobbers. The statement reads: “The attention of Ebonyi State government has been drawn to a social media post being recently in circulation and purported to have been authored by the hard-working Governor of Ebonyi State by miserable and frustrated political jobbers. “For the records, the Governor of Ebonyi State is not against His Excellency, Peter Obi for Presidency but in fact deeply appreciates his courage in his campaign. “His Excellency, Engr Umahi never said that Peter Obi is going nowhere and that he does not believe in Igbo Presidency. “However, His Excellency David Nweze Umahi is a member of APC and shall support the party in all their state and national elections as a good party man. POLL “The Governor believes that most party members will defend their parties during elections and people will freely vote for candidates of their choice.”
