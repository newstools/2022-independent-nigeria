The Global Solar Atlas for The World Bank report says the future is bright for Africa’s solar energy output. The average potential of solar energy around the world and Africa is out in front, the report said. When combining the average long-term practical yield of a utility scale solar energy installation in each country, long-term output exceeding 4.5kWh/kWp per day is described as “excellent conditions for solar power”. Africa’s 4.51 kWh/kWp/day is ahead of second-placed Central and South America’s 4.48, while North America is further behind on 4.37. The untapped solar energy potential in Africa represents an opportunity to provide affordable, reliable and sustainable energy to its people. The assessments “exclude areas due to physical/technical constraints, such as rugged terrain, presence of urbanised/industrial areas, forests, and areas that are too distant from the centers of human activity”, and do not consider “soft constraints, i.e., areas that might be unsuitable due to regulations imposed by national or regional authorities (such as conservation of cropland or nature conservation).”
