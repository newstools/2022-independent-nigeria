Africa No Filter, a donor col­laborative working to trans­form stereotypical narratives of Africa, has launched the Tony Elumelu Storytellers Fund. Named after African business leader and philan­thropist Tony O. Elumelu, the Fund will award grants to emerging artists and sto­rytellers, whose work shines a light on entrepreneurs and entrepreneurship in Africa. The $30,000 fund is spon­sored by Heirs Insurance and Heirs Life Assurance, the insurance subsidiaries of the pan-African investment group, Heirs Holdings. Tony Elumelu, Chairman of Heirs Holdings and Found­er of the Tony Elumelu Foun­dation, has led the champion­ing of entrepreneurship in Africa and has empowered over 15,000 young African en­trepreneurs across the conti­nent through a $100 million commitment made by his Foundation. The Tony Elumelu Story­tellers Fund is a standalone initiative and an extension of his commitment to cata­lysing a redefined African success story, powered by Af­rica’s youth and their creative ideas. The Fund calls on jour­nalists, filmmakers, content producers, and visual and performing artists to sub­mit multimedia creative ideas, that tell the stories of inspiring entrepreneurs and showcase the true and positive spirit of entrepre­neurship in Africa. Appli­cants must be aged between 18 and 35 years, living on the continent or in the Diaspora. They must have a platform or portfolio of work that shines the light on entrepreneurship in Africa.
