LAGOS  – Research released from Climate Policy Initiative, The Children’s Investment Fund Foundation, and FSD Africa finds that Africa needs approximately $2.8 trillion, or $ 250 billion each year, between 2020 and 2030 to implement its Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs). The study shows that total annual climate finance flows in Africa for 2020, domestic and international, were only USD 30 billion, just 12% of the amount needed. The financing gap is significant: All African countries together have a GDP of $2.4 trillion (World Bank 2021), implying that 10% of Africa’s current annual GDP needs to be mobilized above and beyond current flows every year for the next 10 years. Key takeaways from the analysis include: Africa needs approximately $2.8 trillion between 2020 and 2030 to implement its NDCs. Out of this $2.5 trillion must come from international public sources and the domestic and international private sectors. These needs represent 10 per cent of Africa’s total annual GDP. South Africa, Ethiopia, Nigeria, and Egypt have the highest needs per year, together representing almost $151 billion per year These needs as percentage of GDP vary across countries. For instance, South Africa and Ethiopia have needs of 32% and 23% of their GDP, respectively, while Nigeria needed ($12 billion) are only 3% of the national GDP. -Advertisement- POLL Similarly, Egypt estimates needs of around USD 7.3 billion, less than 2% of its GDP. Adaptation accounted for only 24% of total climate finance needs identified, despite Africa being highly vulnerable to climate change and calls for a better balance of finance between mitigation and adaptation. Adaptation needs are likely to be underestimated due to a lack of data and technical expertise to estimate the true cost of adaptation measures. Mitigation accounts for the largest share of reported needs in 2020-2030, at 66% of total climate finance needs. Mitigation needs are predominantly split across four sectors: transport (58%), energy (24%), industry (7%), and agriculture, forestry, and other land use (AFOLU) (9%). However, results are heavily weighted to a few countries, in particular South Africa, which accounts for most transport needs.
