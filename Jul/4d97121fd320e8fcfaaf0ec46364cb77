A “sign war” between a Missouri McDonald’s and a nearby Dairy Queen is going viral, with other neighbouring businesses firing their own shots. The marquee melee began last week when the sign outside the Marshfield McDonald’s was changed to read: “HEY DQ! WANNA HAVE A SIGN WAR?” The neighbouring Dairy Queen soon accepted the challenge with the message: “WE WLD BUT WERE 2 BUSY MAKIN ICECREAM.” A back-and-forth followed, with the eateries trading barbs, including a swipe at McDonald’s infamously oft-broken ice cream machines. Speaking on the situation at hand, the local director of operations for McDonald’s, Randy Bryant said “Marshfield is such a close community, we’re all like family here, Mario on our team had a great idea to get this all started! He said, ‘It’s hot, the world is throwing everyone challenges and negativity,’ so we all found a way to laugh and have fun as a community.” Photos of the warring signs were posted on social media by the Marshfield Area Chamber of Commerce, and soon other nearby businesses joined in the war of words. “Ice cream machine broken? We have a loan for that,” the electronic sign at Arvest Bank read this week. Wendy’s, a chain famous for its acid-tongued Twitter account, fired its own opening salvo at McDonald’s: “HOT AND CRISPY FRIES DON’T ARCH.”
