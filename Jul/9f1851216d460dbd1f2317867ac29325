YENAGOA – The Governor of Bayelsa State, Douye Diri, has congratulated his Delta State counterpart and vice-presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Ifeanyi Okowa, on his 63rd birthday. He described Okowa as an astute administrator and politician with an outstanding record of performance in governance and politics at the state and national levels. This was contained in a congratulatory message issued by the Chief Press Secretary to the Governor, Mr. Daniel Alabrah, on Friday. Diri said Okowa’s exemplary run in all the public offices he had held were a testimonial to his peaceful disposition and his capacity to build bridges of unity and togetherness. He noted that his choice as running mate to the PDP presidential flagbearer, Atiku Abubakar, was equally an acknowledgement of Okowa’s unimpeachable patriotism and loyalty to the country and his party. Diri further described Okowa as a trustworthy friend, brother and colleague in their collective effort to ensure a better Niger Delta region and Nigeria. He said the country stands to benefit more from Okowa’s affable qualities and experience in governance. The governor prayed for God’s continuing blessings, grace and wisdom as he steps higher politically.
