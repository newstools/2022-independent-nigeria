Frank Lampard insists Anthony Gordon ‘is going nowhere’ this summer.Gordon has been linked with moves away from Everton in recent weeks, with Tottenham Hotspur and Newcastle United both named as potential suitors. The homegrown winger is understood to have been touted as a potential add-on in the deal which saw Richarlison leave Goodison Park earlier this month. But Lampard shot down suggestions Gordon, who recently was handed the Blues’ no.10 shirt, could be prised away from his boyhood club anytime soon. “You have to earn the number 10,” said the Everton manager. “I understand this desire for numbers with players. I was fortunate, I kind of fell into a number eight in my career. “I didn’t go searching for it but I understand how it can feel important to you. “But I absolutely feel now, especially with the 10 because it has a little bit of magic to it, a bit of flair, and Anthony’s got that. “He has it in his own style. I’ve said to him, I don’t want him to try and think he’s doing pirouettes on the halfway line now. POLL “We need him doing what he was doing last year plus goals plus assists which Anthony is so hungry to do. “But he’s earned it absolutely and he’s a link to the crowd, a link to the fans, a local boy who gives everything, a great talent. “He’s going nowhere – he’s our player and that was a hugely important thing to me, he’s the sort of player we want to build to go forward with. “I’m delighted that he’s got his no.10 but now I want him to continue to earn it.”
