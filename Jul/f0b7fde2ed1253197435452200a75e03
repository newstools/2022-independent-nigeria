ABUJA – Chieftain of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Dr Garus Gololo, on Saturday took a swipe at the duo of Babachir Lawal (former Secretary to the Federal Government- SGF) and Boss Mustafa, the serving SGF for condemning APC’s Muslim-Muslim ticket. In a terse statement in Abuja, Gololo described both men as “lacking the political and moral capacity to dictate for the party what direction to take in its choice of a VP.” He advised the former SGF to “adopt decorum in engaging in national issues as Nigerians are yet to forget his scandalous exit from the Buhari administration.” According to Gololo, the former SGF is someone who many believe is a person of questionable character even though the allegations against him were cleared by the court. The APC Chieftain added that “the former and current SGF are men who did not deliver their state to the party during the 2019 general elections. “It beats my imagination that such men of little electoral worth will now be the ones directing for the party what to do, and what not to do,” he stressed. He further lambasted Boss Mustafa (serving SGF) for eyeing the Vice Presidential slot, stating that “as SGF, he has not lived up to expectation as can be seen in the performance of the federal government on many fronts.” Gololo underscored that the APC Muslim-Muslim ticket has come to stay, as he cautioned religious leaders against heating the polity over the issue. POLL He advised those against the party’s decision to show their grievances at the poll.
