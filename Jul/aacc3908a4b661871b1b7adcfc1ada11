Manchester United playmaker Bruno Fernandes has called on the youngsters included in the club’s pre-season tour to show their worth and earn a place in the first team squad. Erik ten Hag has taken 31 players over to Bangkok ahead of their friendly with Liverpool at 2pm today. While veteran Cristiano Ronaldo is absent, a number of the squad are either teenagers or in their early 20s. These include Zidane Iqbal, James Garner and Under-18s player of the season Alejandro Garnacho. They will be eyeing a place in Ten Hag’s United squad next season given the Dutch coach’s preference for youth at former club Ajax. All starlets are expected to be given ample game time this pre-season, which includes trips to Australia and Norway. A number could get the nod for the match with Liverpool. Fernandes, meanwhile, is set to be a leading figure in the new manager’s revival. Speaking to club media, he set a challenge for the team’s youngsters to seize the opportunity to impress. “This [tour] has to be a dream for them, in the same way it is for me,” said the 27-year-old, who is also on his first pre-season tour since his January 2020 arrival due to Covid-19 preventing subsequent summer trips. “Age is just a number, they have to enjoy it. “At the same time they have to show they want to be here, want to be part of this team, and they want to play as much as I want to. If they show that and their quality – because they all have quality to be here, to be at this club at this level.
