LAGOS – The Governorship Candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party in Lagos State for the 2023 general elections, Dr Abdul-Azeez Olajide Adediran, also called Jandor, has congratulated all Muslims faithful and  Lagosians in general on this special occasion of Eid-el-Kabir. Jandor made the remark in a message on Friday signed by said Gbenga Ogunleye, Head, Media and Communications, Jandor ’23 Campaign Organisation, stressing that the essence of the celebration is in remembrance of the sacrificial and obedient lifestyle of Prophet Ibrahim (ASW) and his Son, Prophet Ismail (ASW). “This virtue is exactly what we need now in Lagos State to surmount our challenges,” he said. “Life is all about sacrifice. Individuals, organisations and governments must make sacrifices to achieve the rebirth of a truly wealthy Lagos where all residents will heave a sigh of relief and enjoy a breath of fresh air. we all must rise above primordial sentiments, and sectarian interests, and seek the good of our state.” “This occasion affords us another opportunity to right our wrongs by having a deep reflection about this state and how to move it forward.  Prophet Ibrahim (ASW) has taught us the value of sacrifice which should reflect in all that we do, and even in our disposition to other residents of Lagos state without ethnoreligious discriminations,” Jandor said. “He added, “We must tell ourselves that the quagmire we face today in virtually all aspects of our daily life is a result of the selfishness, greed and corruption of our leaders and the mismanagement of the state. “It is disturbing and saddening that insecurity, abject poverty, and perennial flooding as a result of bad roads and drainage systems, among others are issues Lagosians still battle with after over two decades  of our nascent democracy. Jandor urged all Muslim faithful to use the occasion to pray for divine intervention and peaceful, free and fair elections in 2023.
