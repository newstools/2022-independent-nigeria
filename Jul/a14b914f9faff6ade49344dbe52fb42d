An Italian Catholic priest of Somascan Father’s community, Rev. Fr Luigi Brena, 64, who was kidnapped along Ogunwenyi through Usen community in Ovia South West Local Government Area of Edo State has been released by the police in Edo State. A statement on Monday by the Edo State Police Deputy Spokesperson, Jennifer Iwegbu, explained that on receipt of the information on Sunday, police operatives immediately swung into action and trailed the kidnappers to their camp. The rescue of the Italian priest comes on the heels of Sunday’s abduction of two Catholic clergymen, Rev. Fr. Udo Peter of St. Patrick’s Catholic Church Uromi in Esan North East Local Government Area and Rev. Fr. Philemon Oboh of St. Joseph Retreat Center, Ugboha in Esan South East Local Government Area of Edo State. Iwegbu, who was silent on the fate of the two abducted Catholic clerics, explained that on sighting the operatives, the hoodlums opened fire on them, adding, however, that the superior firepower of the police operatives neutralised three of the kidnappers while the rest escaped into the forest with various degrees of gunshot injuries abandoning their victim. The victim was immediately rushed to Igbinedion Teaching Hospital, Okada, Ovia North East Local Government Area of the state for medical attention. The spokesperson said intensive bush combing is ongoing with the aim of arresting the kidnappers now on the run. She reiterated the admonition of the Edo State Commissioner of Police, Abutu Yaro, to people of Edo State not to deter from partnering with the police by availing them with prompt and useful information that will lead to the arrest of criminals terrorising the state.
