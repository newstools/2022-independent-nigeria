Following the report of two suspected ritualists who were burnt to death by an angry mob on Monday for allegedly raping a 10-year-old girl to death and removing her vital organs in Ede-Oballa, Enugu State, the State Police Command has launched an investigation to fish out those responsible for the mobbing. A mob had set two suspected ritualists ablaze in Ede-Oballa, Nsukka Local Government Area of Enugu State. The suspected ritualists were lynched for allegedly raping and dismembering the little girl. The body of the deceased was found in a nearby bush with her viral parts removed. Daniel Ndukwe, the state Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO) who confirmed the incident revealed the identity of the victim as one Miss Eze Nkemdirim. He said, “Investigation has been launched to fish out those responsible for the mobbing and setting ablaze of one Agbo Dere (male) and Ifeanyi Ugwu (male), at Ede-Oballa Nsukka, in the morning hours of Monday, on the allegation of the duo being responsible for the murder of one little miss Eze Nkemdirim aged 10, for ritual purposes. “Preliminary investigation shows that the victim was initially reported missing on 28 June 2022 at about 1 pm, but her decomposing body was found in a bush in the community on 2 July 2022, which led to the action of the irate mob. “Meanwhile, members of the community have once again been called upon to keep supporting the Police to properly investigate and set the ground for the dispensation of justice in criminal cases, rather than resort to self-help of this nature, which attracts dire legal consequences. -Advertisement- POLL “Further development will be communicated, please,” he added.
