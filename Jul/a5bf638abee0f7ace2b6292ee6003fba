Lagos – CAF’s Technical Study Group (TSG) has recommended to CAF for an increase in the number of teams in next year’s Women’s Africa Cup of Nations (WAFCON) from 12 to 16. TSG members, Clémentine Touré from Côte d’Ivoire, Mercy Tagoe from Ghana and Jacqui Shipanga from Namibia, who addressed the media believe that this ongoing tournament has been the best edition in terms of the level of the quality of football played. Consequently, they believe that increasing the number of teams would do the championship would raise the level of competition. Caaording to Clémentine Tagoe, CAF’s decision to increase the number of teams from eight to 12 “made it possible to raise the level of competition,” adding that in the next editions the number of teams should be further increased to 16 teams. “We have seen the level of this edition. The level will be even higher if we have more nations. We are 54 federations in Africa, so it would be wise to have more selections at WAFCON,” said Tagoe. Jacqui Shipanga praised the level of commitment from all participating countries and highlighted the Morocco/Nigeria semifinal as the standout match of the competition so far. The TSG also explained their selection criteria for the “Woman of the match” awards handed out at each of the matches played in this WAFCON. They said several criteria come into play. There are the technical and tactical qualities, but also the attitude of the player during the match, the impact she has on her squad and also her sense of sportsmanship and fair play.
