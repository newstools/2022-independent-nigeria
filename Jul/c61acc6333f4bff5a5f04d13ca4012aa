…Sympathises with families of victims ABUJA – The Presidential candidate of the African Democratic Congress (ADC), Dumebi Kachikwu, called on President Muhammadu Buhari to step down amid rising national security concerns on Wednesday. In a statement, Kachikwu said that the attack on the president’s convoy as it travelled to Daura, Katsina State, and the simultaneous attack on the Kuje Correctional Center were glaring indications that the nation is currently under serious security threat. He questioned who would be secure if both the President’s convoy and the nearby Kuje Prison, which is only a few kilometres from the seat of power, might be targeted. He emphasized that Buhari has failed to bolster the nation’s poor security architecture, which was once again exposed by the twin fatal attacks. The statement reads : “The events of the last 24 hours has once again exposed the weak underbelly of our nation’s security architecture. “Some members of the President’s advance team were slain while the Kuje prison in our nation’s capital was attacked and scores of prisoners released by terrorists. “This is indeed another low moment in a series of low moments under the Buhari administration. -Advertisement- POLL “I sympathise with the families of those killed in the line of duty. “I once again call on President Buhari to do the honourable thing and resign since he can no longer secure the Nigerian people. “Nigerians are paying a huge price for his inept leadership. If the terrorists are now bold enough to attack the President’s convoy and a heavily guarded prison just a few kilometres away from the Aso Villa, who then is safe in Buhari’s Nigeria?”
