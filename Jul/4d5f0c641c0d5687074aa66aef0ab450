ABUJA – The umbrella body of all farmers in Nigeria, All farmers Association of Nigeria(AFAN), has debunked and dissociated itself from the purported N100,000 grant, said to be given to farmers and non-farmers after their online registration. A statement on Monday by Arc. Kabir Ibrahim, National President of AFAN, said “there is nothing like N100,000 grant to farmers and non- farmers being purportedly promoted by AFAN.” According to Ibrahim, “We would like to inform all Nigerian farmers and non- farmers alike that there is nothing like N100,000 grant to farmers and non- farmers being purportedly promoted by AFAN. “The Nigerian public is hereby warned to create distance from these fraudsters by not registering online with them. “We urge you to heed this, as the whole thing is a scam to defraud the poor Nigerian farmers by some unscrupulous elements soon to be named.” It would be recalled that a faceless group called “National Association Of Famers” has launched an online portal, where the group asked farmers and non-farmers to register for a grant of N100,000 per farmer or non farmer.
