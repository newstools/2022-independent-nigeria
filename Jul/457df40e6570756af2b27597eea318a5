Monza have reportedly already met with Wanda Nara twice to discuss bringing Paris Saint-Germain striker Mauro Icardi back to Serie A. The Argentina international shot to fame at Inter and was sold to PSG in the summer of 2019 for a total €50m plus bonuses. His contract runs to June 2024, but he is not part of the club’s plans for this season and has been urged to find himself a new destination. According to RMC Sport in France, Monza have already met with Icardi’s wife and agent Wanda twice to discuss a possible switch. Monza are about to begin their first ever Serie A season, but are backed by former Milan chiefs Silvio Berlusconi and Adriano Galliani, so have high ambitions. They are also based in the Lombardy region, where the Icardi family still have a home and business interests. Icardi spent much of his career in Italy, joining the Sampdoria youth academy in January 2011, then sold to Inter for €13m in 2013.
