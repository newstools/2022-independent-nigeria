LAGOS  – Adebola Famoroti, a business development expert and customer relationship expert, on July 29 held a customer relationship management (CRM) seminar for small businesses, entrepreneurs and people who want to become entrepreneurs. The event held at Eko Hotel and Suites in Lagos. She said that participants learnt how to skyrocket their business sales in the next half of 2022. She stressed the important role customers play in the life of a business, adding that participants were taught how to make customers work for them to increase their sales. Famoroti stated: “I have learnt that the secret of making great sales is to reach more people, and there is a limit to the number of people you can reach. “Why not let your customers reach out to the numbers for you, without them knowing? Your customers will bring you the sales, yes they will. But you have to do just one thing,” she asserted. The business coach urged small business owners, entrepreneurs and would-be entrepreneurs to come to the seminar and learn how to grow their businesses into mega-companies.
