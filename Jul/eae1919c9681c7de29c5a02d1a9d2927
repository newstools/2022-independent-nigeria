 LAGOS – Speaker Mudashiru Obasa of the Lagos State House of Assembly has described the State as the relatively safest part of Nigeria, adding that this feat was recorded following conscious steps by suc­cessive governments since 1999. Speaker Obasa said this on Fri­day in a congratulatory message to Muslims all over the country as the world marks this year’s Eid-el-Kabir. The Speaker noted that the celebration affords Muslims a conscious effort to show love, sac­rifice for one another and ensure a peaceful environment that should continue even after the period. According to him, the peace enjoyed by Lagos residents and in­vestors is the result of the passion of those in government to make the state habitable at all times. “In relation to safety of lives and property, Lagos remains a shining light, a good example of a government that works for its people. With all the arms of gov­ernment working together, we have achieved great feats in the area of security. “Your representatives at the House of Assembly have never shied away from the task of mak­ing our dear state attractive and better for its residents. We have made laws and passed resolutions that have helped in this regard. “The creation of the Neighbor­hood Safety Corps and other relat­ed agencies, the anti-kidnapping and the anti-cultism laws which prescribe serious punishments as well as our review of the criminal justice law of the State are perfect examples of our resolve to always ensure pro-people activities at the House. POLL “We are encouraged by the feedback we constantly receive from both residents of our state and our colleagues in many parts of Africa. We will continue to make Lagos a success,” Obasa said in the statement released by his Chief Press Secretary, Eromosele Ebhomele.
