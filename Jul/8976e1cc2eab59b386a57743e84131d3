The presidential candidate of the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) and former Vice President, Atiku Abubakar will be cutting short his vacation to lead the party rally for the Osun governorship election in Osogbo on Thursday. It could be recalled that the Osun State gubernatorial election is slated for Saturday, 16th of July 2022. With his return, Atiku is also expected to take full charge of the dialogue and mediation processes to resolve the fallout from the PDP presidential nomination processes. In recent times, the opposition party has been embroiled in crisis following the emergence of Delta State Governor, Ifeanyi Okowa, as the running mate of Atiku, against the choice of Nyesom Wike, who was recommended by the party committee. This development has pitched some governors against the party leadership, and also, there are threats from Wike’s camp to leave the PDP. The governors, for the past few weeks, have taken the back seat on activities in the party and have not shown any commitment since the presidential primary. Other parties, have, however, taken advantage of this development and have since made it a duty to woo members of PDP ahead of the 2023 elections. It was also learnt that contrary to media reports that Atiku was vacationing in Dubai, he was spending his vacation in Europe. POLL When contacted, Atiku Media Adviser, Mazi Paul Ibe confirmed that his principal, the former Vice President, will be in Osogbo in person to lead the mobilisation of the people of Osun to cast their votes for the PDP governorship candidate, Sen. Ademola Adeleke.
