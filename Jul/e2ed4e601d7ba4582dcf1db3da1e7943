Paul Pogba has been given a hero’s welcome by Juventus supporters after arriving for a medical in Turin. 90min understands that the 29-year-old will sign a four-year contract with the Bianconeri after leaving Manchester United as a free agent for the second time in his career. The Frenchman previously left Old Trafford to join Juventus in 2012, and he enjoyed a hugely successful four-year spell in Italy before being lured back to United for a fee of £89m. But things didn’t work out as planned for Pogba, as United continued to trend in the wrong direction, and his second stint at the club yielded only two trophies – the Europa League and EFL Cup, both of which were won during the 2016/17 season. Pogba has opted to resume his career at Juventus – where he was previously revered by fans – after failing to agree a new contract at United, and their love for the Frenchman was on display as he arrived for a medical prior to signing his contract. A huge ovation greeted Pogba as he stepped out of a car at the club’s medical centre, and supporters continued to cheer his name as he acknowledged those who had come out to see him. It’s expected that Pogba will be officially announced as a Juventus player in the coming days, and he’ll be joined at the Allianz Stadium by Angel Di Maria – who has signed a one-year deal with the club after leaving Ligue 1 champions Paris Saint-Germain.
