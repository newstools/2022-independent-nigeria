The 2022 ECOWAS Manufacturing Excellence Awards organised by Independent Newspapers, BusinessDay- Ghana and African Consolidated Analytical Limited has been postponed. The award dinner event scheduled to hold Friday, July 15, at the Victoria Crown Plaza Hotel, Victoria Island, Lagos, from 6:00p.m has been shifted to Saturday, July 30, 2022, at the same venue from 6:00p.m. The organisers regret the inconveniences this sudden postponement would cause participating organisations, speakers at the event and invited guests. The event with the theme, ‘Post COVID-19 Economic Recovery: The Role of Africa’s Manufacturing Sector: Prospect & Challenges’, will be attended by dignitaries which include invited Special Guest of Honour, Otunba Richard Adeniyi Adebayo, Minister of Industry, Trade and Investment; Dr. (Mrs.) Lola Akande, Commissioner for Commerce & Industry, Lagos State; keynote speaker, Mr. Damilola Aloba, Consumer, Industry Goods (GIGA) of Ernst & Young, West Africa; special guest and panelist, Dr. (Mrs.) Chinyere Almona, Director- General, Lagos Chamber of Commerce & Industry; Mr. Thomas Omoni, Acting Director General, Nigerian Association of Chamber of Commerce, Industry, Mines and Agriculture (NACCIMA); Mr. Taiwo Adeniyi, President, NECA and invited special guest/panelist, Dr. Segun Ajayi-Kadir, Director-General, Manufacturing Association of Nigeria (MAN). The vision, courage, passion and determination some of the managers of the manufacturing companies have demonstrated in the face of daunting, harsh business climate make the ECOWAS Manufacturing Excellence Awards all the more compelling. This event presents a unique opportunity to profile, critically review, analyze and consider the efforts and contributions of the individuals and corporate leaders in order to recognise, reward and celebrate them.
