We fulfil this promise knowing that the women are the completeness of men, mothers whose prayers God speedily answers, and with our Rivers State that needs God’s guidance and leading to arrive at her desired destination, WE surely need a mother at such place of leadership to pray us through into success. “Because we consulted with no godfather but God our Father in Heaven who rules in the affairs of men, even in the politics of Rivers State before WE came to this resolve, WE believe that a Dumo Lulu-Briggs and Princess Tambari Hilda Dedam ticket is the solution that will make Rivers State great”
