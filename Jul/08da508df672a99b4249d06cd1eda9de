Kaduna-based renowned Islamic scholar, Sheikh Ahmad Gumi on Monday said that the emergence of Peter Obi, presidential candidate of the Labour Party (LP) in the 2023 general elections has brought relative peace to the South-East region. The controversial cleric who stated this via his verified Facebook page said that the support of the proscribed Indigenous People of Biafra, (IPOB) for Peter Obi has, however, indicated that Biafra Republic agitation is political. Gumi who links the current security crisis bedevilling the country to lack of representation said that the Yoruba Nation agitators have also slowed down following the hope that the All Progressives Congress (APC) presidential candidate, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu would emerge president in the forthcoming elections. Speaking further, he said that the major problem of the country now is whether the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) “will conduct free, fair, and transparent elections” in 2023. He wrote, “The IPOB rhetoric and loud voice of Biafra agitations have muffled out with the emergence of Peter Obi as the Labor Party presidential candidate. To them, Igbos have a platform. It’s clear now that the entire IPOB outcry was a political gimmick to get power. “The Oduduwa clamours have abated also since Tinubu has clinched the APC ticket never to resurface again until probably if he didn’t win the race. “Northern Ultra conservatives too have no mouth to speak of marginalization or suppression of representation, the NNPP Kwankwaso has satisfied that segment of the society. No more claims of candidate suppression and manipulation.”
