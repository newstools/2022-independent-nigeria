 AWKA – Members of the 7th legislature of Anambra State are current­ly groaning over the governor’s apparent reluctance to imple­ment the financial autonomy law which was signed by his predecessor, Chief Willie Obi­ano. It is, however, believed that the implementation of finan­cial autonomy will help foster separation of powers as well as financial independence be­tween the legislature, the judi­ciary and the executive arm of government in the state togeth­er with local governments. However, in the present cir­cumstance, lawmakers of the State House of Assembly are disenchanted because the leg­islature is not at liberty to exer­cise full financial independence as state and local government funds are clustered in the exec­utive arm giving room for dic­tatorial tendencies and undem­ocratic practices in governance and administration. Lawmakers have not been paid their allowances between February and June this year. It was observed that the thick forest behind the House of As­sembly Complex in Awka has attracted all forms of reptiles and rodents. Also, lawmakers now un­dertake refreshments from their private pockets in the ongoing budget bilateral talks with ministries, departments and agencies of government. “All these, the legislators be­lieve would have been solved constitutionally and in accor­dance with the rule of law and separation of powers if the three arms of government were granted full financial au­tonomy in the state.” But in his view, Comrade Osita Obi, the Convener Re­cover Nigeria Project believes very strongly that legislators should pay the price other citi­zens have been paying in order to achieve a greater and more prosperous Anambra State.
