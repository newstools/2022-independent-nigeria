Healthcare providers under the auspices of the Medical and Health Workers’ Union of Nigeria (MHWUN) have criticized the alleged neglect of the demands raised by unions within the university system. The healthcare providers particularly took a swipe at President Muhammadu Buhari and other politicians aspiring to occupy leadership positions in the 2023 general elections for feigning ignorance of the demands raised by the various university unions, which has culminated in an indefinite strike for over four months. In a joint statement by MHWUN’s President Com. Biobelemoye Josiah and Com. Auwalu Yusuf Kiyawa, Acting Secretary General respectively, insisted that government must meet the demands of the unions if it hopes to salvage tertiary education from total collapse. Recall that members of the Academic Staff Union of Universities ASUU, Non-Academic Staff Union of University and Allied Institutions NASU, and National Association of Academic Technologists NAAT among other unions have been on strike owing to alleged discrepancies in the implementation of the Integrated Personnel Payrolls and Information System IPPIS and other issues bothering on infrastructural development. The healthcare providers also reiterated that they are in solidarity with the proposed national strike by the Nigeria Labour Congress as their members have been put on red alert to hit the streets once a date is agreed on. Throwing its weight behind the struggle, MHWUN said, “we have followedwith a keen interest in the ongoing industrial impasse in the country’s public tertiary institutions, which had led to their closure on 14h February 2022 and the lethargic response of the Government in addressing the problem. “The ASUU, NASU, SAUTHRIAI, NAAT had been on strike for more than five months due to the apparent failure of Government to sign the re-negotiated 2009 Agreement with ASUU, failure to honour the terms reached at the May 2021 MoU signed with ASUU, and habitual failure of Government to respect Collective Bargaining Agreements willingly signed with Unions. “Also in contention is therefusal of the Government to adopt the home-grown innovative solutions provided by the Unions in the payment of University Workers’ Salaries. POLL “It is equally disheartening to note that since the unfortunate strike started,Government actions and response to such a huge national embarrassment had been more of “motion without movement”. If anything, the Government response has not gone beyond the watery statement of “We are meeting with the Unions…” or the usual outdated tactics of blackmailing Union leaders as in similar situations. “No responsible Government would close down its Public Tertiary Institutions in this 21st century because of patriotic demands for better funding of its universities and good welfare for its teaching and non-teaching staff. This is shameful. “The Leadership of Medical and Health Workers Union of Nigeria isparticularly irked that the Federal Government and the political Actors have abandoned the children of the poor masses at home to waste away, instead, they are seen dissipating energy and resources that could have been used to resolve the issue to fund political tussle to occupy plum offices that previous occupiers have failed to use for the benefit of the masses. “We are more worried about the development because the academic future of the Citizenry is being disrupted whereas the politicians and top Government officials have their children mostly in well funded and equipped oversea schools or in relatively expensive private schools in Nigeria. “Discerning minds will agree with us that the negative impact of the strike tothe future of our children and Nigeria, in general, cannot be quantified. Wecall on people of goodwill to stand up in defence of the right and future ofour children and Nigeria, by demanding Government do the right thingand bring back these children to the classroom. “We condemn in strong terms the lethargic attitude of Government inresolving the issues in contention. “To protect the future of ouryouths whose academic life is being disrupted, we call on the Government toimplement without further delay all the agreements it had entered with theUnions. We urge the relevant MDAs to ensure that President MuhammaduBuhari’s earlier directive to resolve all outstanding issues with the Unions isbacked by immediate acceptable action that would end the stalemate. “MHWUN wishes to use this medium to unequivocally state that we firmlystand behind the University based Unions and the clear position of NLCleadership in this historic struggle. “Our State Councils have been put on ared alert, as we will not hesitate to declare a solidarity strike in support ofthe Unions if Government fails to resolve the issue within a reasonable time”. The Medical and Health Workers Union of Nigeria also condemned in the strongest terms the spate of insecurity in the country, saying the rising orgies of killing, banditry, kidnapping for ransom, and extreme agitation for secession have assumed a dangerous dimension. According to MHWUN hardly anyday passes by without reports of security challenges in some parts of theCountry. Human lives have become so cheap and without value. Josiah said Nigerian workers are no longer safe both in their homes and at workplaces, as many have lost their lives to these enemies of State. “We, therefore, demand a resolute action from Government to end this degrading assault on thethe sovereignty of our Nation. “We equally condemn the current scarcity of diesel, cooking gas, petrol and aviation fuel, and the rising wave of arbitrary prices all over the country. “This pathetic development has further exposed workers whose salaries andincome have already been eroded by inflation, to greater hardship. Thesituation reinforced the earlier call by the organized Labour for resoluteaction on the domestic refining of petroleum. “According to its 2021 OPECreport, Nigeria export petroleum products worth 27.73 billion dollars,but imported refined products of 71.28 billion dollars, leaving a deficitof 43.46 billion dollars. (OPEC Report: March 21, 22). “To our Union, there is no better time to end the madness of petrol importation than now. “Finally, as political activities are hitting up, it has become obvious that thesame political Actors that have brought us anguish, hunger, pains, death,and social and economic woes are seriously preparing to return to power. Wewish to state that it will no longer be business as usual. “We wish to reiterate our earlier call to all our members across the country to ensure they register and obtain their PVCs and wait for further directive from the Leadership of the Union as Nigerian Workers are prepared to take back their country from the economic buccaneers,” the statement added.
