A group of youths under the aegis of the youth network for the right candidates have asked the flagbearer of the ruling All progressives Congress (APC) Dr Nasir Idris (NUT) to revamp education in the state and bring onboard youth in governance if he wins elections in 2023. Arising from their monthly meeting, the state chairman Abubakar isah (Abu labour) said that, the above statement does not signify endorsement giving the name of our network which says rights candidates but we chose to take on him because he is a veteran teacher who rose from a primary school teacher to National president of NUT “so it is not out of place to remind him that if he wins elections he should remain the teacher he is by breathing life into Kebbi education sector, we envisage a collapse of the private schools in Kebbi state under him through an unprecedented overhaul of education which will force the private practitioners to close “. Abu labour added that youth forms at least ninety per cent of Nigeria, s population and therefore have the might to bring on government or off so we expect him to defend their rights as a governor and ensure they are not being used as a political thug” it is our hope that, while forming his government he will give huge slots to youth, and as well push some of them into Agriculture as a means of livelihood. He call on youth to hasten registrations for permanent voters cards (PVC) to vote for the right candidates and stop political thuggery, drugs addiction and prostitution among the female gender, while congratulating him for winning his party’s primaries he admonished him to unify kebbi and bring positive developments in all sectors of the state.
