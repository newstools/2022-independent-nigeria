Governor Samuel Ortom of Benue State has said that his Rivers State counterpart, Nyesom Wike, himself, among others, seen as being aggrieved as a result of the choice of the Atiku’s running-mate, won’t be dumping the main opposition party. Ortom on Arise Television on Thursday stated that even though they are not considering leaving the party, the PDP should allow justice to reign, and that the flag-bearer of the party, Atiku Abubakar, should reach out to Wike. He said: “We are not going to defect to any party. We are members of the PDP. Wike has been instrumental to the growth of our party, in the absence of any former president produced by the party. “Former President Olusegun Obasanjo, elected by our party, retired. Former President Goodluck Jonathan has issues and decided not be involved in activities in the party. Wike remained the anchorman. We (Wike, Governor Ikpeazu, myself) discussed this in our meeting in London, we agreed we won’t leave the party, but let there be due process and the needful to be done, so that everybody will be carried along.,” Ortom said. He added: “Since the emergence of the PDP, Wike has been there. Some of us, because of the injustice meted to us in 2015, left the party for the All Progressives Congress (APC) until when the APC started dancing in the wrong direction, we then returned to the PDP. Wike was instrumental in my returning to the party. “Our presidential candidate also left at a point because he was not satisfied, including our national chairman, who left for other parties, but Wike remained in the party, so he is a big factor.” According to Ortom, “When some of them believed that a southern president was needed, and thought that Wike was going to get the ticket, but it didn’t happen. I was one of the people who advised Wike to take the ticket of the vice presidential candidate since he couldn’t get the presidential ticket. “
