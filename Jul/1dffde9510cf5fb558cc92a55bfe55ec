Justice Inyang Ekwo of the Federal High Court Abuja has ordered the National Identification Management Commission (NIMC) to release the bio-data of David Ukpo to the Attorney General of the Federation (AGF) for onward transmission to the United Kingdom Court. Justice Ekwo gave the order on Wednesday following a request by the Commission and the detained former Deputy President of the Senate, Ike Ekweremadu to defend himself in a London court. Following a suit by Ekweremmadu, the court had on July 1, ordered the Nigerian Immigration Services, the National Identity Management Commission, Stanbic-IBTC Bank and United Bank of Africa (UBA) to supply to Ekweremadu and his wife, a Certified True Copy (CTC) of the biodata information of David Ukpo to ascertain his real age. Despite the court order, at Wednesday proceedings, NIMC represented by Mr Muazu Mohammed said the commission did not obey the Judge’s directive because it was not served with the hearing notice before the order was made. Mohammed had earlier asked for revocation of the order but later amended his motion on notice.In place of revocation of the order, the counsel then requested that NIMC be directed to submit information on David Ukpo to the AGF instead of Ekweremadu for onward transmission to the United Kingdom Court. Chief Adegboyega Awomolo SAN, who represented Ekweremadu did not oppose the amended application. Justice Ekwo subsequently granted the request and ordered NIMC to submit the Biodata to the AGF for onward transmission to London Court.
