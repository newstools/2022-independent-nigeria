Chief Pwul, the first Plateau State indigenous Senior Advocate of Nigeria (SAN) stated this in an interview with newsmen in Jos on the current political development in the state. According to him, if the ruling party in the state did not understand the signs of time and did not not see the champion they have, the youth and those who are disenchanted during the Governorship primaries comes together and form a third force, he will make himself available as a sacrificial lamb. He said, “If you have a virtuous woman as a wife and there is a little problem and she protested and ran to her father’s house, you did not go after her to seek for reconciliation, one, two and three months, neighbours will begin to realize that something good is here and may come for her. He further stressed that ‘”As I said, I am available in APC, but if the youth raise their eyes high and see that there is a possibility of a champion, of course, I am available for them. No matter how strong I am in APC, the reality on ground speak volume, nothing worse than self-delusion and deception “. Paul stressed. He argued that he is in APC but the signs of time are here adding that the handwriting is clearly on the wall and in clear terms that the youth of this country are very sensitive to the reality they are going to face shortly as they have come out to take their destiny into their hands.
