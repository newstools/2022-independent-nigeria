The Senior Pastor of Awaiting The Second Coming Of Christ Ministry, Adewale Giwa, has stated that the move for a MuslimMuslim-ticketsmuslim ticket will spell doom for the party and its candidate at the polls. This is coming after the announcement of the former Governor of Borno State, Kashim Shettima as running mate to the candidate of the All Progressives Congress, APC, Bola Ahmed Tinubu, in the 2023 presidential election. According to Giwa, Nigerians must exhibit consciousness at the polls towards preventing the emergence of such a ticket. He said, “Tinubu has failed with his Muslim/Muslim ticket. I want to urge Nigerians to shine their eyes and vote for who they think have the best equation in picking his deputy,” he said. “The truth be told is that the only viable option Nigerians have is either the PDP or the APC. They should do everything possible to prevent Muslim/Muslim tickets? because it is dangerous. “Already, the country is in religious, economic, and political crises. There are claims that they want to finally Islamise the country. “I have always said that the APC doesn’t mean well for Nigerians. At this crucial time, how can a reasonable politician go for a Muslim/Muslim ticket? Is the country meant for a certain religion? It is now left to Nigerians.”
