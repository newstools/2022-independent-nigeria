LAGOS – The Lagos State Internal Revenue Service (LIRS), said it is currently improving its payment procedures for utmost efficiency and taxpayers’ convenience. Mr. Ayodele Subair, the Executive Chairman of LIRS, in a statement issued on Monday, said the agency, as part of its digitalization process, was discontinuing all previously used bill references effective from August 1, 2022. The statement by Monsurat Amasa, Head, Corporate Communications, LIRS said that according to the Subair, only the Enterprise Tax Solutions (eTax), generated bill references would be acceptable for tax payments. The eTax platform, (https://etax.lirs.net), which went live in October 2019, was launched by LIRS to engender seamless tax operations and reduce compliance costs to taxpayers. The statement hinted that since its launch, e-tax has improved the effectiveness of tax administration in the state. Subair added that the e-tax was built as a one-stop shop for all tax transactions, and it is in the same spirit that the generation of bill references, required for all tax payments was now exclusive to the e-tax platform. He reiterated that by the cutoff date of August 1, 2022, e-tax would become the only authorised channel to generate bill reference for tax payments and other tax-related transactions in Lagos State. To generate a bill reference on e-tax, taxpayers the statement said could use the five easy steps like its portal, input of Payer ID and password to log in, selection of revenue type, and upload schedule, generation of a bill reference and make of payment on any of the multiple channels available, using the generated bill reference.
