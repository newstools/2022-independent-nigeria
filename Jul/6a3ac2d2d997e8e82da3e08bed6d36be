The Convener of the New Nigeria Group, Pharmacist Sam Ohuabunwa, has called on Nigerian leaders and citizens to sacrifice their selfish pursuits to enable the country prosper and attain prosperity. Ohuabunwa made the call on Sunday, in a Sallah message personally signed by him. Ohuabunwa, a former Presidential aspirant on the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party in the just concluded 2023 presidential primary, noted that Nigeria was at a crossroad, with threats of insecurity, economic crisis and unimaginable corruption. “The significance of this festival is rooted in sacrifice. We must emulate the Prophet Ibrahim (AS) in giving our all to Allah in Ibadah. “Our nation is at crossroads , it’s very existence threatened. Threatened by the highest levels of insecurity, economic crisis and untold levels of corruption. Our nation ranks low on every possible index used to measure progress and development. “It is important for Muslim ummah and indeed all Nigerians to reflect on the different demands of sacrifice. “We must realise that to build a nation where justice , prosperity and security reigns , its leadership and citizens must be willing to sacrifice their selfish desires, sacrifice their comfort and surrender our personal ambitions to the will of the Almighty God”, Ohuabunwa concluded.
