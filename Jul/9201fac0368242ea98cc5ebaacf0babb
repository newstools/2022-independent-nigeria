Senate Minority Leader, and head of the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) Caucus in the Senate, Philips Aduda, had charged the Osun State governor-elect, Senator Ademola Adeleke, to use his enormous goodwill, experience and expertise to develop the state. The federal lawmaker also charged the governor-elect to use his undisputed capacity to ensure people-based and development-oriented programs that will bring development, happiness and fulfilment which have painfully eluded Osun State under the failed All Progressives Congress (APC) administration in the State. Aduda, in a statement, described the emergence of Adeleke as Osun State governor-elect as a new dawn in the history of the state, adding, “your reverberating victory over a sitting State governor underpins your undisputed popularity across the state and reinforces the confidence the people of Osun State repose in you as the leader with the much-desired drive, passion and capacity to rescue, redirect and rebuild their State at this critical time.” Aduda said that Adeleke’s success on the platform of the PDP “also underlines the widespread popularity of our great party, the PDP, not only in Osun State but also in the South West geo-political zone and the nation at large. “The loud rejection of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in the Osun governorship election is a pointer to the humiliating defeat that awaits it in the 2023 Presidential election given the overwhelming popularity of the PDP.” Aduda charged the Governor-Elect to, “in line with the manifesto of our great Party, embark on such programs that will bring succour to the ordinary people.”
