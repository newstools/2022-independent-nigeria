ABUJA – Ahead of the 2023 general elections, the presidential candidate of the Social Democratic Party (SDP), Prince Adewole Adebayo, has pledged to put education first and involve young people in leadership positions. He gave the assurance when the National Association of Nigerian Students (NANS) leadership paid a courtesy visit on him at his Abuja home. Adebayo urged the student body to come to the defence of the country’s educational sector while pledging to speak for the interests of the general public and youths through a policy that supports and ensures a smooth educational system. Earlier, the leader of the delegates and National Secretary of the National Association of Nigerian Students (NANS), Mr Salahudeen Lukman said the purpose of the visit was to speak with presidential candidates for political parties on their agenda for the educational sector. Lukman, however, advocated for more funding for the sector to save it from incessant strikes and urged the federal government to find a lasting solution to the current industrial action embarked upon by the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU).
