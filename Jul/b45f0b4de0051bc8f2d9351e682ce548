The 1977-1982 set of Fiditi Grammar School Old Stu­dent Association (FIGSOSA) has celebrated its 40th reunion anniversary by donating 100 banquet chairs at a cost of N1.2 million to their old school. While presenting the chairs to the principal of the school on behalf of the 1977 – 1982 set, HRM Oba Sikiru Oyewole, the Onifiditi of Fid­iti, thanked the set for their contributions towards effec­tive teaching and learning in the school. He charged other sets to emulate 1977-1982 sets by con­tributing their own quota to their alma mater. According to the chairman of the set, Mr. Adekunle Sol­omon Olugbade, the yearly programme was designed “to reunite souls, recount the good old days of brotherly or sisterly unconditional love and to celebrate the wrinkles, baldness and the gray hairs that marked our mileage.” He said that the essence of an alumni association such as FIGSOSA “is to recognise, honour and celebrate those who have attained political, professional or material sta­tus in life as well as those who were once our childhood friends, but are unable to at­tain some certain heights in life.”
