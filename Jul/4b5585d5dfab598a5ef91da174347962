The Court of Appeal sitting in Akure, Ondo State on Wednesday ruled in favour of Senator Ademola Adeleke, the Governor-elect of the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) in the just concluded Osun State gubernatorial election. The Appeal Court upheld Adeleke’s victory as the lawful governorship candidate of the party in the state, according to Naija news. It could be recalled that the party had on March 8 2021, conducted two governorship primaries featuring Adeleke and Babayemi in Osun State ahead of the governorship election. Babayemi was declared the winner of the primary election held at the Children and Women Development Center in Osogbo, while the primary held at the Osogbo City Stadium under the supervision of Deputy Governor of Bayelsa State, Lawrence Ewhrudjakpo, produced Adeleke. In order to be recognized as the PDP’s lawful governorship candidate, Babayemi subsequently made his way to the Federal High Court in Osogbo. But in a ruling by Justice Nathaniel Ayo-Emmanuel, the court upheld Adeleke as the Osun State PDP’s duly elected governorship candidate. Dissatisfied with the ruling, Babayemi filed a suit at the Court of Appeal, Akure, challenging the judgment of the lower court and seeking to be declared as the PDP governorship candidate. details later……
