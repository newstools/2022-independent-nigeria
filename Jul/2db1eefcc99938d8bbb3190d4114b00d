THE Confederation of African Football (CAF) has postponed its flagship competition, the Africa Cup of Nations. The biannual competition was initially slated to hold in January 2023 in Côte d’Ivoire but the continental body, arising from its meeting in Rabat, Morocco, on Sunday has shifted the tournament to January and February of 2024. CAF also announced changes in Champions League and Confederation Cup finals. CAF Executive Committee led by Patrice Motsepe took the decision to shift the AFCON initially, billed for June and July 2023, saying it was due to the concerns over the rainy season in Cote d’Ivoire. Recall that while speaking to French daily publication Le Monde last week, CAF Secretary General Veron Mosengo-Omba, admitted they were considering a change in the date due to the weather conditions. “We are considering it; it is one of the possibilities.“We asked Ivorian meteorologists to report to us on rainfall history in Côte d’Ivoire in June and July, but also to share their projections with us.” Aside from the decision to postpone the 2023 AFCON, the CAF Champions League and Confederation Cup finals were reverted to home and away format.
