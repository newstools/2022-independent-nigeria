 P/HARCOURT – The Commissioner of Police, Rivers State Com­mand, CP Eboka Friday, has ordered a full scale investigation into the bar­baric murder of a police of­ficer in the state by yet to be apprehended gunmen. CP Eboka also ordered for a massive deployment of personnel across Oy­igbo Local Government Area of Rivers State where the dastardly act took place, to fish out criminal elements and perpetrators of violent crimes against the people of the area with a view to bringing a lasting peace to that part of the state. This is coming on the heels of the gruesome murder of an Assistant Superintendent of Po­lice, ASP Chris Josiah, at­tached to Afam Division­al Police Headquarters in the evening of June 28, 2022, while returning home after work. “The deceased Offi­cer was ambushed by five yet-to-be-identified armed masked men, who opened fire at the Officer along Assemblies of God Church, Obeama Commu­nity, Oyigbo, and shot him dead inside his Lexus RX 300 SUV,” the CP said. A statement issued by the Command on Thursday and signed by the Police Public Rela­tions Officer, PPRO, DSP Grace Iringe-Koko, said the Commissioner of Po­lice has equally ordered a full-scale investigation into the incident with a view to unraveling the remote and immediate causes of the attack and bringing the perpetrators to justice. “The CP strictly warns that further attacks on Po­lice officers charged with the protection of lives and property will not be toler­ated by the Police author­ities,” he stated. He however advised criminal elements in the area and indeed across the state to leave as he would haunt them to their holes.
