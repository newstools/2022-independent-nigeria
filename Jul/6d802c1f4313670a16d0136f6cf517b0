Ukraine has severed diplomatic relations with North Korea, which Kyiv condemns for recognizing Russian-occupied breakaway regions that have declared independence. North Korea is one of a handful of countries, including Syria and Belarus, that recognize or support the recognition of the “people’s republics” of Donetsk and Luhansk as independent states. Ukraine maintains these regions are part of its territory, a position for which it has widespread international support. “Russia has no more allies in the world, except for countries that depend on it financially and politically, and the level of isolation of the Russian Federation will soon reach the level of isolation of the DPRK,” Ukraine’s Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba says in an statement on cutting diplomatic ties with North Korea, formally known as the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea. North Korea’s recognition of the two breakaway regions came on Wednesday. The North Korean ambassador to Russia, Sin Hong-chol, met his Donetsk counterpart Olga Makeyeva in Moscow. Makeyeva said she was confident that “cooperation between countries, which now has official status, will be fruitful and mutually beneficial,” Tass reports. 1:30 a.m. Chinese and Russian military activity around Japan increased 2.5 times in the four months following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24, sparking alarm here over a potential escalation.
