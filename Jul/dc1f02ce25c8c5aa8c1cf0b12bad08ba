LAGOS – The presidential candidate of the African Action Congress (AAC), Omoyele Sowore, has officially presented Barrister Haruna Garba Magashi as his running mate. Sowore, who made the presentation to his party chiefs at the weekend in Abuja, stated that his running mate is from Kano State. According to a statement issued by the party, Sowore during the presentation, said that Magashi had all it would take to deliver Kano for the AAC in the 2023 presidential election. He said: “We hope to defeat All Progressives Congress (APC) over there because the governor has messed up. We know that we will defeat the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). That is the party that is in crisis as we speak. “We don’t need to talk about the Labour Party in Kano because the party does not exist. “We know that we will defeat Alhaji Kwankwaso and his party, the New Nigeria Peoples Party (NNPP) in Kano because we have got someone who is from there.” The AAC, it would recall, had earlier submitted Magashi’s name to the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC).
