Rodri has signed a new Manchester City contract until 2027 as the club continues its excellent summer window. The Spanish midfielder, signed in 2019 for £62.8m, endured a difficult first few seasons at the Etihad but came into his own during the last campaign and was one of the best players in their Premier League title win. As well as bossing the midfield, he also scored some crucial goals – including the equaliser against Aston Villa on the final day when he steered the ball home with pinpoint precision from outside the box. Rodri had entered the final two years of his contract with Cit y so this new deal sends a strong message to any interested clubs that his long-term future is in Manchester, as well as continuing an excellent summer so far for the Blues that has included the arrivals of Erling Haaland and Kalvin Phillips. Rodri has won two league titles and two league cups in three years since joining City. While he has enjoyed them, they have only made him want more success and he feels that the Etihad is the best place for him to do that. “Joining City in 2019 is the best decision I have made in my career,” he said. “I have loved every second. The fans have been amazing with me, I feel totally supported by the club and the manager pushes me every single day. “I have improved so much as a player, and I want to thank Pep and all the backroom staff for their help. They are completely committed to helping me become the best player I can be, and I appreciate their hard work. “We have been very successful since I came here, which is something that makes me very proud. But to be honest, that success has made me even more hungry for me. Once you start winning big titles, you don’t want to stop. “City, I feel, offers me the best chance of winning trophies and that’s why I am so pleased to be staying here for longer.”
