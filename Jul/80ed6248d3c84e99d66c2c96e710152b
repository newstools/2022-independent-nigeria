ABUJA – Nigerians may have to contend with widespread blackout as the National grid on Wednesday collapsed to 40Mw around 12:23 pm. Of all the distribution companies, only the Abuja Electricity Distribution Company (AEDC) recorded 40Mw at that material time with others recording 0Mw. The National Grid on Wednesday suffered another system collapse resulting in a blackout in many parts of the country. It is about the 18th time a nationwide blackout would be recorded this year. While some collapses were not made public because they lasted for a short period, many others were made public and lasted days in some cases. Eko Electricity Distribution Company (EKEDC) confirmed the latest development in a statement on Wednesday. “Dear Customers, we regret to inform you of a system collapse on the National grid at precisely 11:27a.m today, July 20. “We are in talks with the Transmission Company of Nigeria to ascertain the cause of the collapse and a possible restoration timeline. POLL “We will keep you updated on the situation,” the electricity distribution company said. It is unclear how many states are affected by today’s grid collapse.
