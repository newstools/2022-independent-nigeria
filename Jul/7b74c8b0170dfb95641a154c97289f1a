London on Saturday celebrated the 50th anniversary of its first Pride parade, marking half a century of progress in the fight for equality and tolerance but with warnings that more still needs to be done. Several hundred people took part in the first march on July 1, 1972, walking from Hyde Park Corner to Trafalgar Square, just five years after homosexuality was decriminalised in the UK. Fifty years on, more than 600 LGBTQ+ groups were among expected crowds of over one million, dancing, singing and riding floats along a similar route to the original protest, in the first Pride since the coronavirus pandemic. London Mayor Sadiq Khan told reporters the event was a celebration of community, unity and progress. But he said it was also a reminder of the need to “campaign and never be complacent” and the need for “an open, inclusive, accepting world”. “We saw this time last week an attack in Oslo just hours before that parade, where two people lost their lives and more than 20 were injured,” he said. “So, we’ve got to be conscious of the fact that there’s still a danger to this community of discrimination, bias and violence.”
