One of the leading retailer of luxury goods, Polo Limited, has introduced IWC Schaffhausen, makers of Swiss timepieces, into the Nigerian market. Jennifer Obayuwana, Executive Director of Polo Limited, in a statement, commended IWC for its “progressive outlook, which has allowed the brand to continually re-invent. She added: “IWC has created ladies’ watch models regularly since the late 1870s, one of which is the Da Vinci Lady Chronograph. The IWC brand is a promise of durability, reliability and value for money. “IWC uses bronze for manufacturing of its products. For us in the watch-making business, this is innovation because bronze is a material scarcely used by watchmakers. “The brand is also dynamic in its ability to cater for its fans in aviation with truly sporty, active, and fast-moving lifestyles, while serving a distinctly conservative demographic as well.” The partnership is to leverage the loyalty enjoyed by the Swiss watch brand, while also welcoming a new crop of product lovers. With IWC’s entry into the Nigerian market, timepiece collectors are granted easy access to the 154-year legacy of watch-making innovation that includes products such as Portugieser, Pilot Watch and Da Vinci.
