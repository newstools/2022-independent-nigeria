Retired Brig. Gen. Mohamed Buba Marwa, chairman/chief executive of the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (ND­LEA), has said drug users and addicts no longer had excuses not to seek treatment with the commissioning of a modern 24/7 call centre attend to Ni­gerians from all parts of the country. Marwa spoke at the commis­sioning of the NDLEA call cen­tre with toll free helpline and manned by professionals and experts in counselling, psycho­therapy, psychology and psychi­atry among others in Abuja on Thursday June 30, 2022. According to him, “the pro­vision of this toll-free helpline is a milestone in our resolve to broaden access to quality healthcare for drug users in the country. This has become a necessity and a strategic in­tervention in our determined effort to bring under control the increasing cases of drug use disorder and related health concerns.” He said though the country has treatment centres and ND­LEA has 26 treatment facilities across its commands, they are nevertheless grossly inade­quate in the face of statistics of drug users and those suffering from drug use disorder “NDLEA recognised the im­portance of providing a safety bubble for users who ordinarily cannot access the convention­al treatment services at estab­lished rehabilitation centres due to poverty, social stigma and the resultant discrimina­tion attached to being an identi­fied drug user in society, among other factors. “Therefore, the inevitability and the utility of a toll-free help­line that guarantees anonymity, confidentiality and safety, as a motivation for those in need of health help to freely seek such.”
