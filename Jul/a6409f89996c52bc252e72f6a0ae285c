ONITSHA – An Onitsha-based businessman and patron of Importers Association of Nigeria, Chief Gilbert Bravo Obi, has insisted that the best man for the office of the next President of Nigeria is the former Governor of Anambra State, Mr. Peter Obi. Obi told our correspondent in Onitsha that the antecedents of the former Governor have shown that he remains the only presidential candidate, who has exhibited quality leadership when he was a governor. He explained that a man who has refused to collect pension even as a former governor is the type of man needed to govern the country because of his selfless leadership. According to Obi, who lamented the rot in the governance of the country, while other candidates corruptly pacified their party delegates with thousands of dollars at the recently concluded primaries, Obi deliberately left them to continue to flaunt their ill-gotten wealth. He asserted that a man who bribed himself to power was capable of undermining the tenets of civility and good governance to assuage his hunger for power. He advised Nigerians who have attained voting age to acquire their voter cards in order to guarantee the future of the country in 2023. “I appeal to Nigerians who have attained voting age, especially in the South East region of the country to go for their cards as that is the only weapon with which to install a good government that will be answerable to the people.” “We must not continue to shout of marginalisation in our own country. We are among the owners of Nigeria. Nigeria belongs to us all. The only way we can move Nigeria forward is to elect a good and God-fearing President which Peter Obi represents,” he asserted.
