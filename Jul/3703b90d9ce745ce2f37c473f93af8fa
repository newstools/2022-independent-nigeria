BAUCHI – The Minister of Humanitarian Affairs, Disaster Management and Social Development, Sadiya Umar Farouk has been warned by a political group known as APC Initiative for Good Governance to steer clear of Bauchi State politics, saying that she should concentrate on her ministerial functions to avoid heating up the political scene of the state. The warning was contained in a statement by the Coordinator, APC Initiative for Good Governance, Bauchi State, Nasiru Cigari, which was made available to newsmen yesterday. The group alleged that the minister, who is married to the gubernatorial candidate of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) Saddique Baba Abubakar, was interfering in issues of politics which did not concern her. According to the group, she should mind her business and avoid poking her nose into issues that do not concern her. “It is no longer news that the ticket of APC House of Representatives of Bauchi Federal constituency is vacant, following the withdrawal of its standard-bearer, Hon Shehu Aliyu Musa who was nominated to serve as the running mate of Bauchi state APC gubernatorial candidate, Ambassador Baba Sadique Abubakar from Giade LGA of Bauchi North Senatorial zone of the state” “This development necessitated the party to call for a new nomination to fill the vacant position. However, recent moves and scheming to impose the current Member, (who was earlier rejected by his constituents who, even his membership of the party was in question) by the Minister of Humanitarian Affairs who also doubles as Wife of the Governorship candidate stands condemned by all voices of reason.” “To set the records straight, the Minister has no stake in the politics of Bauchi state and Bauchi LGA by extension. If she has any moral obligations to do so, then that should be in Shira/Giade Federal Constituency (the adopted constituency of her husband)” The group said.  POLL
