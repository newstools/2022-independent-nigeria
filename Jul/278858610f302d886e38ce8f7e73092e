 JOS – Hon. Baba Hassan, the All Progressive Congress (APC) candidate for Jos North/Bas­sa Federal Constituency and former deputy speaker of Plateau State House of As­sembly, has warned against spilling blood of innocent cit­izens as campaigns for 2023 elections get underway. Hassan in an interview with newsmen in Jos recently noted that he kicked against a situation whereby innocent Nigerians’ blood would be spilled simply because of his ambition to contest elective positions in the forthcoming general elections in 2023. According to him, it is only God that gives power to whoever he wishes, nomatter hissupportbase. He argued that, “If there will be bloodshed and I will be the cause, God should not give me victory.” The former deputy speak­er and currently the mem­ber representing Jos North- North State Constituency in the Plateau State House of Assembly advised that cam­paigns should be based on is­sues, the political parties and not on religion or ethnicity. He pointed out that if elect­ed, the good people of his con­stituency should expect good legislation that would have direct bearing on their lives as he has been in the business of legislation for the past 16 years. Hassan further said as a former deputy speaker, he has the required experience to serve his people in higher capacity and to consolidate on the gains of democracy by the Governor Lalong ad­ministration on the plateau.
