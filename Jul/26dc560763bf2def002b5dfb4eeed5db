All Farmers Association of Nigeria (AFAN) has dissociated itself from a portal calling for farmers to register and claim N100,000 grant purported being giving by association. In a statement entitled ‘SCAM ALART’ signed by Chief Chinedu Agbaji, AFAN’s Director of Administration, the association warned the general public to be wary of scammers, declaring ‘we are not in any way giving grant of N100,000 to farmers’. The statement further assured members of AFAN that improving welfare of farmers through strategic business partnerships is underway and remains paramount in the association’s agenda. “This is to inform the general public that All Farmers Association of Nigeria (AFAN) Lead by Dr. Alh. Farouk Rabiu Mudi, that we are not in any way giving grant of #100,000 to farmers or opened a portal where farmers can register online for the said grant, we disassociates ourselves from the purported #100,000 farmers and non farmers grant of National Farmers Association. “We want to assure AFAN Members that their welfare is paramount and we are doing everything within our capacity to improve it, just as we have started repositioning farming business in Nigeria through our strategic partnership and business relationships. “Note also, that our channel of communication flows and will remain from the national to the ward level through the state Executives, otherwise through the media signed by the NEC” reads the statement in parts.
