A road crash that occurred along the Lagos-Ibadan expressway has claimed the lives of four persons. Five persons were said to have been injured in the incident, involving nine persons – six male adults, two female adults and one male child. The spokesperson of the Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC) in Ogun State, Florence Okpe, said, “Four persons were recorded dead from the crash, all male adults”. Okpe said a Toyota Sienna marked KJA738ET had rammed into a Howo trailer registered as KMC548YD. “The suspected cause of the crash was excessive speed which led to loss of control on the part of the sienna bus driver, who collided with the truck when the truck driver was trying to reverse. “The injured victims were taken to Victory Hospital, Ogere for medical attention while the corpses were deposited at FOS, Ipara morgue,” Okpe said.
