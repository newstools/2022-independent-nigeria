Bayern Munich sporting director Hasan Salihamidzic has again insisted that the club will not be signing Cristiano Ronaldo this summer, despite star striker Robert Lewandowski edging closer to a move away from Bavaria. As reported by 90min, Barcelona have agreed a €50m deal with Bayern for Lewandowski’s services, with La Blaugrana hoping to have the transfer agreed by the end of the weekend. The Poland international’s departure would leave Die Roten with a sizeable void up front, and they have been linked with Ronaldo recently. However, once again, those at the top of the club have definitively ruled out the Manchester United forward joining Bayern this summer. “I have a lot of respect for Cristiano Ronaldo, his successes and his career. But once again: That was and is not a topic for us,” Salihamidzic told Sport. 90min understands that Ronaldo has asked for United to consider any reasonable offers for his services this summer. Chelsea, Bayern and Napoli were initially contacted over a possible move, but the pool of interested parties is shrinking. United manager Erik ten Hag has also insisted that he wants Ronaldo to remain at the club this season.
