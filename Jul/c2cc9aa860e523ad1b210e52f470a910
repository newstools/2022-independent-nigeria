Juventus have opened talks with Villarreal as they look to find a deal for Pau Torres, who could replace Matthijs de Ligt, but they’ll have to fight off competition from Manchester City. The 25-year-old Spanish defender is keen to leave Villarreal this summer in order to take the next step in his career and he has no shortage of options, with a number of clubs around Europe interested in a possible move. In recent days, however, Juventus and Manchester City have both seriously entered the fray. As reported by Eurosport, Villarreal want around €50m for Torres, a figure considered excessive by Juventus, who are looking to offer around €40-45m. They would look to offer the Spaniard a contract worth around €5m net per season. The Bianconeri cannot push for a deal until they finalise the sale of De Ligt to Bayern, who may look to close things out soon now that Robert Lewandowski has been sent to Barcelona. 90min reports that Manchester City are also keen to pick up Torres as they face obstacles in their work to sign Marc Cucurella from Brighton.
