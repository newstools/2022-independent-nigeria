The trial of Senator Ike Ekweremadu and his wife, Beatrice, has been adjourned to August 4, 2022. The couple were arraigned at Westminster Magistrate’s Court over alleged organ harvesting, on Thursday. Gavin Irwin was the counsel who represented Ekweremadu, while Szilvia Booker represented the wife. A high-powered Nigerian delegation was in court for the trial of the former Deputy Senate President. Former Senate President David Mark, whom Ekweremadu worked with; former Senate Minority Leader, Eyinnanya Abaribe; former Minister of State for Education, Hon. Chukwuemeka Nwajiuba; and Chairman, Senate Committee on Foreign Affairs, Adamu Bulkachuwa, were all in court. Earlier, the counsel of Ekweremadu denied any form of exploitation in case. He said, “We deny that there was exploitation or intent to do so.” The counsel said this while presently giving his opening address. The lawyers of the defendants argued that the victim lied about his age but the prosecution insisted that he is a minor. The court subsequently ruled that the victim is not a minor. Based on the judge’s ruling, the victim, David Ukpo, is no longer considered a minor in the trial. The Ekweremadus will appear at the Central Criminal Court in London on August 4 for the continuation of the trial.
