NNEWI – The ongoing demolition of structures erected at illegal plac­es in Anambra State has ignited fear among landlords in Nnewi. Sources said that landlords and tenants are now worried , fearing that their houses might be demolished when the task force takes the exercise to Nne­wi. A source in Nnewi who did not want his name mentioned told Daily Independent, Mon­day, that some structures erected on gutters along Owerri Road, Nnewi -Nnobi Road, Nnewi -Onitsha Old Road, Nnewi -Awka Etiti Road and others too close to the roads in the town would be pulled down if the taskforce on the demolition exercise gets to Nnewi. Another source, Chinedu Ogbofoli in an interview said there was a structural Master Plan designed by Nnewi Youth League (N Y L) Lagos Branch, for beautification of Nnewi , but regretted that the plan had since long been abandoned while structures had continued to be erected everywhere in the town. He said rumor had it that landlords and some rich tenants in the town are now allegedly making frantic efforts to reach Governor Soludo with the view to stopping the demolition exer­cise from reaching Nnewi and to sideline some houses when the demolition exercise reaches the town. “Nnewi has no design. The Nnewi Youth League has a good Master Plan designed for Nnewi. But our fear now is Government might go ahead to demolish the alleged illegal structures. If they can demolish Odumeje’s Church and Catholic Church building, the same fate might befall Nnewi,”Ogbofoli said.
