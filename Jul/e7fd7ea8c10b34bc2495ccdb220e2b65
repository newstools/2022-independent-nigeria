LAGOS – Mirabel Centre, Nige­ria’s first Sexual As­sault Referral Centre, (SARC) celebrated its ninth year anniversa­ry Wednesday, July 6, 2022 in Abuja. The British High Commissioner, Catri­ona Laing CB, hosted the accountability dialogue re­ception in her Residence, bring­ing together donor partners and critical stakeholders from across the country. The reception was a plat­form to celebrate the Centre’s milestone, strengthen trust and accountability, discourse chal­lenges as well as receive feed­back and evaluation that would enable the centre continue to further fulfill its mandate from partners. Founded on the July 1, 2013 by Itoro Eze-Anaba, the Mirabel Centre provides succour and a safe place to survivors of rape and sexual assault in Nigeria. Survivors who have recently or in the past been sexually assault­ed can access free post-incident support services at the Centre. In the last nine years, the Centre has provided free med­ical and psychosocial support services to nearly 7400 survi­vors (including boys, men, and persons living with disabilities). British High Commissioner in Nigeria, Catriona Laing CB, said, “I am delighted to recognise and celebrate the work done by the Founder of Mirabel Centre, Itoro Eze- Anaba, and the entire Mirabel Centre team as the or­ganisation celebrates its ninth anniversary. It remains a sad reality that women continue to be victims of sexual violence and abuse in Nigeria today. We cannot understate the vital im­portance of the exemplary sup­port sexual assault centres like Mirabel provide. I look forward to continuing to partner with Mirabel Centre for many more years to come as we all seek to end sexual violence.”
