Michael Gove has been sacked from the Cabinet after urging the Prime Minister to resign earlier on Wednesday. No 10 confirmed that Boris Johnson fired Mr Gove as Levelling Up Secretary after the Cabinet minister refused to publicly affirm his support for the Prime Minister and privately urged him to go. A No 10 source told the BBC: “You cannot have a snake who is not with you on any of the big arguments who then gleefully briefs the press that he has called for the leader to go. You cannot operate like that.” (SOURCE: iNews)
