 AKURE – No fewer than 3,000 people in Zamfara State have ben­efited from the free medical fiesta sponsored by national women leader of the All Pro­gressives Congress (APC), Dr. Betta Edu. The free medical exercise, which is part of the grassroots empowerment programme of Edu, provided free tests for blood pressure, sugar level, free surgeries among others. In her address after Gover­nor Bello Matawalle had de­clared open the free medicare, Betta said: “It is imperative to support the effort of our people’s governor, Governor Bello Matawalle, in his quest to lead Zamfara State towards the path of sustainable devel­opment. “It is a known fact that one of the core factors that en­gender personal and public development is the quality of life provided by the healthcare system. “Quality health is a prior­ity. His Excellency Governor Bello Matawalle has done very well and we will sup­port him to reach out to more citizens of Zamfara State, as well as Internally displaced persons.”
