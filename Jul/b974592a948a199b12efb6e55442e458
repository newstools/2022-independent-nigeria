Eroton Exploration & Production Company Limited said that it had successfully shut-in CAWC015 well amid efforts to contain CAWC047 wild well spill. Following the oil spill incident in Cawthorne Channel Well 15 (CAWC015L/S) which occurred on June 15, 2022, the indigenous oil producer has confirmed that the spill has been successfully contained and the well brought under control. The company also was pleased to confirm that CAWC-047 that was also vandalized within the same month and flowing to the environment since Sunday, July 10, has just been controlled. It said efforts are ongoing to complete a spill clean-up of the wellhead slot, a proper securement, and the subsequent installation of subsurface downhole plugs. It would be recalled that both spills were due to willful sabotage by unknown persons. In an update sent out to newsmen, company spokesperson, Mercy Max-Ebibai, stated that the Well Engineering Team and the Well Control vendor assiduously worked to establish control across all the flowing points on the vandalized wellhead, affirming that in the light of the sabotage, the team had to fabricate a platform on a work barge (as the well head platform had been initially totally cannibalized) before control valves could be installed and well shut-in achieved. She also informed that following the preliminary Joint Investigative Visit (JIV), a JIV with all relevant stakeholders, including NOSDRA, the Ministry of Environment and the community was held on July 15, 2022, with the intent to estimate spill volume and Post Spill Impact Assessment. She confirmed that the clean-up exercise will be wrapped up at the earliest possible time. POLL Finally, she commended members of the affected community, stating, “As excellent hosts, they provided all the necessary support in arresting the situation despite the hazards posed by the incident. We are happy that their seafaring and economic activities can return to normal in no time.”
