A former federal lawmaker Shehu Sani, has said ederal government will do all that is needed to get the Kaduna-Abuja train attack victims who are currently held hostage out of captivity. Recall that the victims were kidnapped about three months ago when the bandits attacked the train and killed several passengers. Relatives of the victims have however threatened to take over government facilities within the state to demand release of the abductees following the inability of the Federal Government. Sani who spoke during a private meeting with the family members of the victims in Kaduna, lamented the deteriorating security crisis in the country. He said, “As long as they remain hostage in the hands of terrorists, the people of North-western Nigeria and the whole country will never be free and comfortable. “What is very clear to every one of us is that the life of every hostage is more important than any price we are going to pay to get them out. There is no price that is too much to get this hostage out of captivity. “The terrorists have made their demands and I believe it is not too much for the federal government to do all that is needed to get this hostage out of captivity.”
