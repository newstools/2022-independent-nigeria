LAGOS – The Inspector General of Po­lice, IGP Usman Alkali Baba has ordered investigation into popular singer, Ha­beeb Okikiola, other­wise known as Portable’s claim of forming a cult group known as ‘One Mil­lion Boys’. The IGP ordered the Commissioner of Police, Lagos, CP Abiodun Ala­bi to investigate the vi­ral video by the Zazu Zeh crooner after he claimed to have formed the cult group in Lagos. Portable has however deleted the viral video where he made the claim. A statement signed by the Force Public Relations Officer, CSP Olumuyiwa Adejobi stated that: “Se­quel to the trending video of one Habeeb Okikiola aka Portable where he claimed to have formed the One-Million Boys cult group terrorising some parts of Lagos State, the IGP has ordered CP Lagos to investigate the indict­ing statement and take necessary legal action.” Adejobi noted that the directive is premised on the continuous effort of the Nigeria Police Force to fish out pillars and sponsors of cult groups in order to decimate their activities and restore sanity to our society.
