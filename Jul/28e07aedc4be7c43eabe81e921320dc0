AWKA  – It was dancing galore and jubilation in Awka as the traditional ruler of Ifitedunu in Dunukofia Local Government Area of Anambra State, His Majesty Igwe Emeka Ilouno, Eze Dunu Igwe Ifitedunu, led indigenes of the town on a thank-you procession to Governor Charles Chukwuma Soludo’s office. Indigenes of Ifitedunu, who were in very high spirits had placards with various inscriptions showing that they were indeed very grateful to Soludo whose intervention in the town union crisis quelled the situation and reinstalled Uchenna Nwoye as the authentic president-general of the town union whom they unanimously concurred was the people’s choice and winner of the town union election. Some of the indigenes who spoke with newsmen during the procession at Government House Awka, said Governor Soludo has restored peace and stability in Ifitedunu town even as they alleged that the town has been under siege and that some people have been unjustly arrested and languishing in police cell. Comrade Chukwuemeka Anthony Ugoozo a former labour leader who hails from Ifitedunu said certain embarrassing developments happened in the past in Ifitedunu community where in the election, which brought Uchenna Nwoye Oragwuncha into office on 30th December 2019, was denounced by intrigues of some dissidents in the town. Ugoozo said the dissidents made allegations of murder against Uchenna Nwoye Oragwuncha but unfortunately they could not produce the person he killed or bring the parents of the person he murdered. That it was on the basis of the murder allegation that he was pushed out and a caretaker committee installed by the previous administration of Willie Obiano.
