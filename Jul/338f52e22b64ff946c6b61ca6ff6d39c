 LAGOS – Social media celebrity, Ismaila Mustapha, popu­larly known as Mompha, was on Thursday absent in court again, hence his alleged N6 billion money laundering trial before an Ikeja Special Offences Court was stalled. Mustapha and his company, Ismalob Glob­al Investment Ltd., were charged by the Econom­ic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) on eight counts of N6 bil­lion laundering. Justice Mojisola Dada had on June 22 issued a bench warrant for Mus­tapha’s arrest following his absence in court. Dada also revoked the bail she granted the de­fendant. The social media ce­lebrity was equally ab­sent in court on June 16. On June 10, EFCC ac­cused him of flouting the court’s order by travel­ling to Dubai with a new international passport. On Thursday, EFCC counsel, Mr. Samuel Daji, told the court that the commission was still in the process of re-ar­resting Mustapha. -Advertisement- POLL He prayed the court to adjourn the case. Defence counsel, Mr. Kolawole Salami, also prayed the court for an extension of time to bring back the defendant to court. Dada adjourned the case until September 21 for further report. The charges against Mustapha include con­spiracy to launder mon­ey obtained through unlawful activities, and laundering of money ob­tained through unlawful activities. The other charges in­clude retention of pro­ceeds of criminal con­duct, use of property derived from an unlawful act, possession of a doc­ument containing false pretences and failure to disclose assets.
