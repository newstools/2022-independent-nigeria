ABUJA – The African Export-Import Bank (Afreximbank) has announced a grant to Grand Africa Initiative (GAIN) aimed at training two hundred young African entrepreneurs on entrepreneurship and intra-African trade over a three-month period starting July 2022. Daily Independent gathered that the GAIN-Afreximbank Masterclass on Entrepreneurship and Intra-African Trade is a three-month programme designed to equip participants from across the continent with the skills to grow and expand their businesses across borders. The training will also enable participants gain key insights on existing business opportunities while developing trade finance management skills, integral for building partnerships that leverage the opportunities of the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA). A faculty of experts from around the world will provide technical advisory and financial lessons to the participants. Recall that the Nigerian government is a signatory to the AfCFTA agreement, which is meant to facilitate economic growth in the continent, by boosting productive ventures across regional boundaries. The programme is also aimed at broadening inclusiveness in the implementation of the AfCFTA through interventions that support young Africans, women, and small and medium-sized enterprises. Programme participants will be selected from eligible applicants from all countries across Africa. Interested participants are requested to put in an application for the programme. Chinwe Okoli, Executive Director of GAIN, while giving further insight said, “This is the second in a series of GAIN Entrepreneurship masterclass designed to empower African youths, the first edition held in 2021 benefited youths from 13 countries across Africa. Beyond the training, the participants will have access to a unique community of like minds for accountability and sustained motivation.”
