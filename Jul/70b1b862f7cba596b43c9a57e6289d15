Passengers on a Spirit Airlines had a frightening landing on Sunday morning in Atlanta, United States, when their plane caught fire on the tarmac. A spokesperson for the airline, said the incident happened after one of the brakes of the plane overheated. According to a video posted on social media, flashes of flames appeared near the plane’s tires as clouds of smoke billowed out toward the back upon its landing at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport around 9:30 a.m. ET. A statement on the Atlanta airport’s Twitter account said that the incident was due to brakes’ catching fire and that no injuries were reported. “At 9.25am today, brakes in the landing gear of @SpiritAirlines flight 383 from Tampa ignited. @ATLFireRescue put out the fire and the aircraft was towed to gate D2 where passengers disembarked. There were no injuries reported and operations have not been impacted,” the airline tweeted. The plane has been removed from service pending its repairs and maintenance. It isn’t the first time the airline has dealt with a fire on one of its planes. In October, passengers were taken off a Spirit flight that was supposed to depart from Atlantic City International Airport in New Jersey after a “large bird” flew through the engine, causing a jet fire and forcing the pilots to abort takeoff.
