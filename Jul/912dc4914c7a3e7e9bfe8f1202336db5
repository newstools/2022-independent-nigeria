Fresh from sealing a deal to sign Paulo Dybala, Roma are now looking at reviving their interest in Feyenoord’s Marcos Senesi, according to reports in Italy. The Argentina defender had been heavily linked with Roma earlier in the transfer window but reports of interest from Giallorossi has cooled in recent weeks. Calciomercato.com report agents representing Senesi arrived in the Italian capital on Wednesday to see if there was still interest in pursuing a deal. The report suggests Roma director Tiago Pinto responding positively to the encounter but any deal would be predicated on Feyenoord dropping their €16 million asking price. Senesi has made it clear to the Dutch giants he is set on a move to the Stadio Olimpico, the report adds, but Roma are not willing to go above €10m. In order for the deal to happen, Roma would need to offload a defender with Marash Kumbulla a candidate as Torino would be interested in signing the Albania international as a replacement for Juventus-bound Gleison Bremer.
