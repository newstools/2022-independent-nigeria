ABUJA – Mr Vipul Agrawal, Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of Dangote Cement in Zambia, has assured the government of Burundi that the company’s Head office in Lagos will fast-track the request made to the conglomerate to address the scarcity of cement in the Central African nation. Agrawal made the pledge when Amb. Pascal Ruhonmvyumworo, the ambassador of Burundi in Zambia led six of his country’s government officials on a tour of the Dangote Cement factory in Zambia, assuring them that the company would not only advance a short-term measure to address cement scarcity in Burundi but a long term to the shortage of construction materials especially cement, in that country. Earlier during the tripartite business meeting involving the Missions of Nigeria and Burundi as well as management of Dangote Cement Zambia, and summoned by Ominyi Nwannebuike Eze, the Nigerian High Commissioner to Zambia, the Burundian Delegation disclosed that their country is endowed with large deposits of limestone, magnesium oxide and silicon oxide, in Burundi’s Northwest region. The Burundian government, therefore, invited Dangote to establish a cement factory in the country as a lasting antidote to the scarcity of construction materials. In the short run, they urged Dangote to work out “modalities for the supply of construction materials and equipment for public work to Government of Burundi by the Dangote Cement Company including, the establishment of cement storage facilities that would cater for public works. “In this regard, the Burundian delegation further requested the CEO to avail it with payment modalities, stressing that the Government of Burundi is ready to sign credit letter with Dangote Cement, Zambia,” Ominyi Nwannebuike Eze stated in a letter he wrote the Foreign Affairs Minister, Mr Geoffrey Onyema. The Nigerian ambassador to Zambia further told the minister that “the success of Dangote cement has no doubt elevated the image of Nigeria in the host country and as its tentacle is being spread to other parts of Southern and East Africa” adding that “the Mission has never relented in its efforts to take any legitimate actions capable of engendering the growth and development of Company and any other Nigerian investments in Zambia in line with the citizen diplomacy thrust of the Federal Republic of Nigeria.”
