An Accountant identified as Emmanuel Omoru has allegedly murdered his pregnant wife and hanged her corpse to fake suicide, Naija News reports. According to reports, the incident occurred at their residential home, in Omozuise Street, Off Street 2, Lucky Way, Aduwawa, Benin City, on July 16th, after the deceased accused the suspect of having extramarital affairs. The father of the deceased,  Festus Agho, told newsmen that his daughter, Cynthia has severally complained of her husband Emmanuel Umoru’s infidelity, adding that the latest was a girl identified as Tosin, a POS operator, who Emmanuel had earlier introduced to his late daughter as a goddaughter but was eventually discovered to be one of his concubines. Trouble started after Cynthia went to confront the POS girl over her affair with her husband which angered the accountant. Festus Agho further revealed how he sued for forgiveness after his son-in-law Emmanuel Umoru called and reported his daughter’s action to him. He, however, expressed sadness that at about 11:56 pm on Saturday, July 16, 2022, Emmanuel Umoru’s landlord called and informed him that his daughter had hanged herself. “I met police officers from Aduwawa who said I cannot go in to see the corpse of my daughter. “But from what I have seen so far, I want the Edo State government, a commission of police in Edo State, and relevant authorities to help me ask my daughter’s husband what he did to his wife. My daughter did not take her life”. POLL The state Police Public Relations Officer SP Chidi Nwabuzor said Mr. Emmanuel Umoru has been taken into police custody. “Operatives met the body dangling on a rope tied to a ceiling fan in her bedroom. “The Body was evacuated to our hospital for autopsy and preservation while the preliminary investigation is ongoing”.
