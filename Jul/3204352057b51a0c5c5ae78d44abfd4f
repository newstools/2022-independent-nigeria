One leading company in Nigeria that is ensuring that youths are well equipped with skills and getting job opportunities is MOJEC International, an indigenous meter manufacturing company. It collaborated with the Federal Government of Nigeria to train the youths in manufacturing and installation. The training dubbed, MOJEC Meter Training Institute is a nationwide programme seeking to train and employ Nigerian men and women across the country in MOJEC’s franchise areas called EKEDC, IBEDC, IKEDC, EEDC, JECC, KAEDCO, AEDC. After meter production, the most limiting factor to the deployment of meters is the herculean task of installation and the dearth of manpower required to achieve these installations. For a 1 million nationwide meter roll-out programme, the industry barely has sufficient skilled labour of up 5,000 teams nationwide as opposed to 20,000 or more teams required across the country. The project targeted 5,000 teams, making a total of 10,000 individuals while the first instalment was carried out by 1000 teams, making a total of 2,000 individuals. Participation was opened to persons from 18 years and above, while the academic qualification requirement is Ordinary National Diploma (OND)/ Technical College Graduates (Engineering Preferable). It would be recalled that the United Nations General Assembly, in 2014, declared 15 July as World Youth Skills Day. The declaration was meant to celebrate the strategic importance of equipping young people with skills for employment, decent work and entrepreneurship. Since then, World Youth Skills Day has provided a unique opportunity for dialogue between young people, Technical and Vocational Education and Training (TVET) institutions, firms, employers’ and workers’ organizations, policy-makers and development partners.
