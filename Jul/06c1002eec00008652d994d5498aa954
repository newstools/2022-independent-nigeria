Barcelona have recently splashed a fortune by securing the services of Robert Lewandowski. The former Bayern Munich forward is set to sign a four-year contract at Camp Nou, with the club likely to fork out a fee of around €45 million, plus €5 million in performance-related variables. Many critics suggest Barça have overpaid for Lewandowski, as he is set to turn 34 by the start of next season while he had only one year remaining on his contract at Allianz Arena. However, as per Gerard Moreno, Barcelona are expected to recoup some of their investment by selling shirts of Lewandowski. The earnings could be as high as €20 million, which is almost half of their overall investment in the star forward. Widely regarded as one of the best strikers to ever grace the beautiful game, Lewandowski is indeed one of the most popular players in world football. He is also arguably the most high-profile signing Barcelona have made since the capture of Luis Suarez in 2014. Although the Polish international may not yield the same merchandise revenue as someone like Lionel Messi or Neymar, Lewandowski can still help Barça bag millions in the market. The former Borussia Dortmund starlet is already one of the favourites to lift the Ballon d’Or title in 2023, after closely missing out to Barcelona’s Lionel Messi last time around. His chances of winning the prestigious award could maximise tenfold if the forward can continue his merry ways of scoring goals and prevail in the newly-formed La Liga rivalry between him and Real Madrid’s Karim Benzema.
