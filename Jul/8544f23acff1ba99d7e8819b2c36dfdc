Arsenal are set to jet off for their pre-season tour to the USA on Wednesday, but Thomas Partey, Bernd Leno and Folarin Balogun will be left at home. Pre-season has already begun for Arsenal, and they’ve managed to score five goals against both Ipswich Town and Nurnberg, with new signing Gabriel Jesus hitting the ground running. And they’re due to play Everton, Orlando City and Chelsea over in the United States as part of their upcoming tour. But although there will be some new faces playing in front of Arsenal’s American supporters, three usual names will not be there. Partey, Leno and Balogun are three of the more senior stars who are being left to train back at London Colney. Partey missed the crucial run-in at the end of last season that saw Arsenal slip out of the top four. The 29-year-old played 45 minutes against Ipswich but did not make the trip to Germany to face Nurnberg. Both Leno and Balogun are remaining in London as they are suspected to complete moves elsewhere this summer. Leno has seen his no.1 spot compromised as Aaron Ramsdale has starred since joining from Sheffield United last summer, and the arrival of Matt Turner has put his place in further jeopardy. Fulham are in advanced negotiations with Leno as they look to secure a new no.1 for their first season back in the top flight after winning the Championship last season. They were in talks with Thomas Strakosha from Lazio, but the Albanian is set to join Brentford instead. Balogun spent last season out on loan at Middlesbrough, and is likely to seal another loan switch for the upcoming season. The youngster is still rated by Mikel Arteta, but the signing of Jesus and the new contract for Eddie Nketiah has meant Balogun must look for minutes elsewhere in the short-term.
