A former Senator representing Kaduna Central Senatorial District, Shehu Sani has cautioned Nigerians against linking the former Borno State Governor, Kashim Shettima to Boko Haram terrorists. The All Progressives Congress ( APC ) presidential candidate for the 2023 polls, Bola Tinubu at the weekend announced Shettima as his running mate. The announcement of the former Governor has generated a lot of reactions on social media in what many Nigerians described as Muslim- Muslim tickets thereby causing disaffection within the party. He disclosed this in a statement on Monday while reacting to the allegation that he frustrated the rescue and release of Chibok girls. Sani said those opposing the Muslim- Muslim tickets have the constitutional right to express their mind but called for caution in tagging the former Governor of having links with Boko Haram. He said Shetima while in office as Governor of state invested his time, energy and the resources of Borno state in combatting, containing and curtailing the activities of the terrorist group. He added that the Shettima have no hand in the abduction of the Chibok girls as been insinuated adding that he has done more in contributing and supporting the operations of the Army and other security agencies in protecting the people of Borno state and by extension Nigeria. According to the Senator” As a stakeholder and former chairman Senate committee on the Humanitarian Crisis in the North East, I’m privy to the fact that Shetima attracted massive presence and intervention of international NGOs and donor countries to the humanitarian situation in Borno. POLL ” I’m not a member of the ruling party but the truth is that other than issues of religion, he is better qualified in terms of competence than many who were paraded. ” Religion is a sensitive matter in Nigeria; Other than that, Nigeria’s most important challenge is security, Shetima’s experience can be useful and is very much needed “
