Peter Obi, presidential candidate of the Labour Party (LP) on Wednesday said that he would engage in dialogue with the proscribed Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), the Yoruba Nation and others agitating for secession if elected as president in the forthcoming elections. The former Anambra State Governor who stated this while speaking in an interview on Arise Television’s Morning Show said he had observed over the years how issues of agitations were handled in other countries. He said that the agitation was birthed by poor leadership in the country which, according to him, had been the issue with Nigeria over the years. Clearing the air on his reported support for the IPOB, Peter Obi said he had never been involved in any agitation. He said, “I have never been in any agitation. I had said that the agitation is because of leadership failure over the years. I will engage them in dialogue if elected into power”. Biafra agitation stemmed from leadership failure on the part of the government, amounting to years of social neglect, and economic and political isolation of the people in Nigeria and particularly people from the South East of the Nation in general. The alleged insensitivity of the federal government against the plight of Ndigbo is being touted as fuelling the struggle for Biafra Independence by Igbo groups. Leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) in Australia, Chief Cyprian Okoye, told reporters in Enugu State that the current agitation over the republic of Biafra would continue as much as the federal government had insisted on treating Ndigbo as non-members of the country. -Advertisement- POLL He stated that Ndigbo had not been treated fairly, stressing that the abuse faced by its people was exacerbated in the current administration of President Muhammadu Buhari.
