Communities in Warri South Local Government Area of Delta State, under the aegis of OML 150 Communities Consultative Forum have commended the Interim Administrator/Managing Director (IA/MD), of the Niger Delta Development Commission, Effiong Okon Akwa on approval of projects in their communities. The OML 150 Communities Consultative Forum in a signed statement signed by Monday Agbeyi, Executive Chairman and Oritseweyimi Aginejuoune, Secretary-General, said they are the registered trustees of OML 150 Communities Consultative Forum. According to the statement, they represent Ifiekporo, Uwakeno, Omadino, Ewekwara, Jaluwa/Efueye, Aja-Osola, Oboro and associated communities in Warri South Local Government Area of Delta State. The forum in the statement expressed appreciation to the IA/MD for the prompt response to the plight of their communities in approving and including the Abicity Water Front at Ifiekporo/Ubeji in the NDDC’s budget for construction of shoreline protection and pilling. They stated that the approval has brought hope to the indigenes and residents of the area who have been under threat due to the continual washing away of their lands and houses, which had left some members of the affected communities homeless and in a state of despondency. The forum appealed for speedy execution of the project in tandem with the wish of HRM Ogiame Atuwatse III, Olu of the Warri Kingdom, who is very much interested in the welfare of his subjects and the fast development of his domain.
