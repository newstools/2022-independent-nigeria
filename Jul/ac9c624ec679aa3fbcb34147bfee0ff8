President Muhammadu Buhari has denied the report of giving a two-week ultimatum to the Minister of Education to resolve the dispute between Federal Government and Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU). The Presidency debunked the report via a statement released on Wednesday by Garba Shehu, Senior Special Assistant, Media and Publicity to the President. The statement partly read, “It is a pity that almost all media houses allowed themselves to be deceived by interested sources that are not the authorised spokesmen of government. “Neither during nor after the meeting was any ultimatum given to the Minister of Education. “During the meeting, the Minister of Education requested that the Minister of Labour hands off the negotiation to allow him lead and conclude what he had earlier on started with the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU). “And he promised that he could get an agreement within the shortest possible time, possibly two to three weeks. “In carrying out this assignment, the Minister will carry along all relevant ministries and agencies with statutory functions and duties relating to the issues involved.” The Presidential media aide further warned the mafia aganist spreading false information and urged the affected parties to work together to end the strikes. POLL He said, “On the part of the administration, all doors remain open for dialogue and the resolution of the issues. “We appeal to the media not to try to spread misinformation. The orchestrated media narratives seeking to present an entirely different picture, attributed to sources, in the last 24 hours are not helpful at all.”
