Lagos – The Federal Airports Authority of Nigeria (FAAN) has said the 18L/36R runway of the Murtala Muhammed Airport (MMA), Lagos, would be shut from Friday till September 5, 2022. FAAN said the closure of the runway would enable it to install the air field lighting (AFL), which has been down for over a decade. The agency said that during this period, traffic would be diverted to the 18R/36L (international runway) for seamless operations by airlines. A statement by Mrs. Faithful Hope-Ivbase, the Ag.
