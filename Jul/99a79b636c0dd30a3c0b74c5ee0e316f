Neco Williams is having his medical on Sunday ahead of his transfer from Liverpool to Nottingham Forest. The right-back is understood to be moving to the City Ground for a fee close to £17 million. His arrival will represent the second wide defensive acquisition of the window for Forest, who confirmed the signing of Omar Richards from Bayern Munich earlier on Sunday. Forest head coach Steve Cooper had identified the wide defensive positions as key areas to strengthen ahead of Forest’s return to the Premier League. Williams, 21, would feature at wing-back on the right of a three-man defence, which is Cooper’s preferred system at Forest. Liverpool were happy to sell Williams after bringing in Calvin Ramsay as Trent Alexander-Arnold’s deputy in a £6.5 million deal they struck with Aberdeen. Williams has been with Liverpool since under-9s level and accepted he needed to move on this summer to secure regular game time ahead of November’s World Cup in Qatar. The Wales international has made 13 senior appearances for Liverpool but spent the second half of last season on loan with Fulham. He played 14 times, scoring twice. Williams also won promotion to the Premier League while at Craven Cottage. POLL On the left side, Forest are also keen to recruit Harry Toffolo of Huddersfield Town, who has only a year left on his contract and is likely to cost in the region of £2.5 million. Cooper has already added striker Taiwo Awoniyi from Union Berlin, defenders Guilian Biancone and Moussa Niakhate from Troyes and Mainz respectively and Manchester United goalkeeper Dean Henderson — on a season-long loan — to his ranks. Wolves attacking midfielder Morgan Gibbs-White is also a target.
