Following the order of the Federal High Court sitting in Abuja disqualifying the Rt Hon Sheriff Oborevwori, erstwhile candidate of the PDP for the 2023 gubernatorial elections, the Peoples Democratic Party may have to conduct fresh primaries to elect a suitable candidate for the polls within the window allowed for the substitution of candidates if the party does not wish to be excluded from the 2023 general elections. The Federal High Court sitting in Abuja had disqualified Rt. Hon. Sheriff Oborevwori, candidate of the Delta State Peoples Democracy Party (PDP) for the 2023 governorship race, over discrepancies in his certificates. The court, in her ruling on Thursday also restrained Oborevwori who is the speaker of the Delta State House of Assembly and anointed candidate of the state governor, Ifeanyi Okowa, from parading himself as the candidate of the PDP for the Delta 2023 governorship election. The court order followed a suit instituted by David Edevbie, a former commissioner for finance, who is the anointed candidate of former governor James Ibori against Oborevwori’s candidacy. The only option left for the PDP, a source within the party has said is to conduct a new primary before the final date of change of candidates since the electoral act does not permit the runner-up to automatically become the candidate. The Court had held that the allegation of certificate forgery brought before the Court by Chief David Edevbie was proven and that Oborevwori ought not to have participated in the gubernatorial primaries in the first place over his ineligibility for the office he sought. While a source close to the Speaker of the Delta State House of Assembly was sure of the possibility of an Appeal against the Court order, the PDP may not gamble with her stake in the coming polls by exploring the option of Appeal instead of conducting a fresh primary election in the weeks ahead within the window for substitution of candidates for the coming polls which is the only thing allowed by the Electoral Act in the current circumstance.
