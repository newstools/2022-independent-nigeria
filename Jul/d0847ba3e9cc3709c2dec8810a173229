 AWKA – Provost of the Federal Cooper­ative College, Oji River Enugu State Nigeria, Dr. Owan Oboda­gu Tonica says the institution is a breeding ground for entrepre­neurs who will become wealth creators and employment pro­viders after their sojourns in the college. Dr. Owan, who spoke through the Head of Department of Coop­erative Economics and Manage­ment of the institution, Dr. Egor Hikarofemise on the occasion of the 2022 World Cooperative Day tagged ‘Cooperatives Build The World’ said students of the insti­tution gained practical knowl­edge and skills relevant to their choice areas of discipline to en­able them become self-employed, self-reliant, self-dependent and wealth creators while helping to reduce unemployment and allevi­ate poverty in the country. The Provost noted that in line with the theme of this year’s glob­al celebration of Cooperatives, the emphasis is on how cooper­atives could be used as veritable platforms to build the world economically and otherwise. He said practical skills acquisition programmes have been intro­duced into the college curricu­lum to enable the students learn by doing what they were taught in the classrooms. This, according to him, would ultimately transform the students into employers of la­bour. The Provost, who mentioned some of the cardinal principles of Cooperatives to include love fair­ness, solidarity, to list just a few, said entrepreneurship centres exist in the school where students undergo practicals on the theories they learnt in the classrooms as stipulated by the National Board for Technical Education. It made it mandatory that every student that would graduate from the college must undergo practical training sessions free of charge on hand craft and a host of other very important skills.
