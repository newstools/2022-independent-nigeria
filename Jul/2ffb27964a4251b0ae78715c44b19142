ABUJA – Ahead of the 2023 presidential elections, the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) Minister of State, Dr. Ramatu Tijjani Aliyu, has mobilized thousands of women across the 36 of the federation and FCT to support the All Progressives Congress (APC) presidential candidate, Sen. Bola Ahmed Tinubu. Speaking at the presentation of the women group to the flagbearer of the ruling party, the minister assured that Nigerian women are ready to throw their numerical strength behind the APC Presidential candidate. This was contained in a statement issued by her SA Media, Mr. Austine Elemue which a copy was made available to newsmen on Friday in Abuja. While calling for unity among party faithful, Aliyu further stressed that in this struggle to victory, no one would be left behind. This statement reads: “we storm this premises to show our numerical strength and to affirm that we mean business. POLL “This is a further demonstration that Nigerian women and APC women are solidly behind our father, the flagbearer of the All Progressives Congress. “We came from far and wide. Precisely, we came from all the 36 states of the federation plus the Federal Capital Territory (FCT)”. Aliyu, however, tasked the women to tell others about the numerous achievements recorded by the party, saying “if we don’t tell our story, the story will be told from the other end the way they like”. The minister further said “We are united to tell our own stories. We are charting a new course that this journey will leave no one behind”. In his response, the APC Presidential candidate, Sen. Bola Ahmed Tinibu, commended the women group for the solidarity, adding that with team work victory would be guaranteed. Tinubu said, “I assure you that our campaign team will contact the leadership of all the states. I love you all. And thank you very much. With the support from all of you, victory is guaranteed”.
