. Insists Suspension Not According To Party’s Constitution . Warns Officials Against Acts Inimical To 2023 Goals ABUJA – The New Nigeria People’s Party (NNPP) has thrown its support behind its Bauchi State Chairman, Sani Shehu, stating that he remains the party’s authentic Chairman in the state. In a statement by its National Publicity Secretary, Agbo Major, on Wednesday, the opposition party also condemned Shehu’s suspension by the North East Zonal Secretary, Babayo Liman. It said Liman’s action without the consent and approval of the Party’s Zonal Chairman, Kawu Ali and the National Working Committee (NWC) is a flagrant violation of NNPP’s Constitution. Agbor also said that the suspension is, therefore “set aside, null and void, and of no effect.” He added that “NNPP believes in due process, the rule of law and strict adherence to its Constitution registered with the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC).” Moreso, the party warned its “officials at all levels to desist from taking any action that will cause disaffection and division among members as we jointly strategize, mobilize Nigerians and move into the 2023 general election that will redefine the destiny of the nation and create a new Nigeria that citizens desire and deserve.”
