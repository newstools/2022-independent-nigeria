The ongoing governorship poll in Osun State, though generally adjudged peaceful, has recorded some rowdiness right at the Onikolo Polling Unit in Iragbiji where the incumbent Governor Gboyega Oyetola just cast his ballot. Commenting on the situation, the governor who is seeking a second term in office on the platform of the ruling All Progressives Alliance (APC), stated that given the high number of registered voters at the unit, the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) ought to have calved out at least one more polling unit from the Onikolo Polling Unit to avoid the apparent rowdiness and the attendant voter inconvenience that have tainted the voting exercise in the governor’s voting venue. Meanwhile, operatives of INEC at the unit are currently working hard to ensure that the situation does not go out of control. This is even as the consortium of security personnel from across the agencies are up and doing to safeguard against any foreseen chaos that may be borne of possible tension.
