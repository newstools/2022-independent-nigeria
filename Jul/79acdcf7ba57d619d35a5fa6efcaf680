Chelsea face competition from Barcelona and a number of rival clubs to sign Jules Kounde, according to Sevilla chief Monchi. The LaLiga club expect Kounde, aged 23 and valued at £51million, to link-up with their squad for pre-season once he has recovered from surgery on a groin injury. Monchi has acknowledged both Chelsea and Barcelona’s interest but has suggested that concrete bids are only starting to arrive for the French defender. He told Onda Cero: “Xavi has good taste wanting [Ronald] Araujo and Kounde as centre-backs, they’re not a bad pairing. But so far there is zero contact with Barcelona. “I know that Chelsea have to find two centre-backs, but the interest in Kounde comes from England and other countries. I would have to be a fortune teller to know what is going to happen. “There are calls from everywhere. The money is starting to roll in a little. It is what we have left until August 31. “Kounde has established himself with France and will play the World Cup. It is logical that there is interest in him and there is. “As of today, he is recovering from the injury in Los Angeles and will later head to Korea with the rest of [Sevilla’s] internationals.”
