The Council of Church Leaders and Ministers (CCLM) on Monday in Ilorin, Kwara State described the decision of Bola Ahmed Tinubu, presidential candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC) and his party to anoint the former governor of Borno State, Kashim Shettima, a Muslim, as his running mate. According to the council,  such a decision is disappointing to say the list. The group that made their stance known in a press conference as part of events to commence the 26th edition of the annual fellowship conference tagged “The Church in the time like this”  in a press conference.  “The suggestion of a Muslim-Muslim ticket is all about impunity and a callous lack of consideration for others,” the group said. Addressing the media on the state of the nation, the chairman of the council, Pastor Abel Aiyedogbon, said “our political leaders are not sensitive to the feelings of the citizens of the country because the behaviour of the political class most of the time shows that personal ambition and interest are the overriding goals and not patriotism. “How will anybody think about fielding candidates of the same religion for the first and the second place when the constitution of the country recognizes secularity. “One will not be wrong to say that trampling on the religious rights of Nigerians is manifest in the idea of the Muslim-Muslim ticket, which some people are now championing. It should be noted that people maligned and presented as inconsequential are not likely to forget. POLL “It is a form of religious intolerance to even contemplate either a Muslim-Muslim ticket or Christian-Christian ticket. “Any party that thinks or believes that the Christian population can be ignored without consequences will be doing so at its peril,” the group said. The council also wondered what APC thinks of Christians in the North. “Does it means that the Northern Christians have no electoral value,” the conference asked.
