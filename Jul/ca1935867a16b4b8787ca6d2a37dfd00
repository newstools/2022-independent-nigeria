It is against that backdrop that, BAT , who has issues with the academic certificates that he submitted or did not submit to the Independent National Electoral Commission , INEC has become another source and cause of tension and talking point engaging the attention of Nigerians from the mosques , churches, barbers shops, market squares to online social media platforms dominated by the youths, as they animately and passionately debate what the future portends.The question now is , would Tinubu , who given the fact that he has successfully fought numerous political battles- university of Chicago certificate scandal as lagos state governor , 1999-2007 and narcotics racketeering indictments in the USA during his sojourn in the Diaspora as recently reported on by Bloomberg , survive the current bogeys- Muslim-Muslim ticket which he will likely resort to  at a great risk and minimum educational qualifications quagmire of which he may be compelled to present his primary and secondary school certificates to avoid being disqualified ?Given his antecedents of navigating political stormy waters , his fans believe that BAT like the proverbial cat that has nine lives would prevail as they are optimistic that the current ill wind would eventually blow away.On the part of the main opposition, PDP and it’s presidential candidate, Turaki Atiku Abubakar , since his emergence as the flag bearer on 28th May , there has arisen more or less been an anarchic situation of a stunning proportion.It started with the party going against its presidency rotation policy practiced since it was birthed in 1998/99 and embedded in its constitution. In the belief that an opposition party may not be compelled so much to hinge its future on a party dogma than leveraging a winning formula and candidate with the brightest chance to win , the rotation pendulum was not allowed to swing to the south as was expected. Instead, a more pragmatic approach of building on the momentum (about 13 million votes) already gathered by her presidential candidate in the last presidential contest in 2019,Atiku Abubakar was adopted. To some extent , unlike the unforeseen circumstances that threw up Asiwaju Tinubu as the presidential candidate of the APC, the emergence of Abubakar as PDP’s standard bearer can not be said to be unanticipated.That is underscored by the fact that the party debated and agreed to throw its presidential candidacy open instead of rotating it exclusively to the south, as it should have, all things being equal.Like the quagmire afflicting the APC which looks like catch 22, by not respecting the party’s presidential rotation agreement , the PDP has left a bad taste in the mouth, not only of PDP members from the south east and south zones which are the party’s strong hold, but also of the middle belters who have been vociferous along with Ohaneze-lgbo sociopolitical group , PANDEF -Niger Delta platform of the same hue with Ohanaze and Middle Belt Forum, MBF,  a north central states political forum who are thumping their noses at the PDP presidential candidate, Atiku Abubakar.Further muddying the water is the fact that , Nyesom Wike,the current governor of Rivers state , who is from the south-south zone , also contested for the presidential ticket ,and ended up as the first runner up to the winner of the contest. But he has subsequently been passed over as running mate to Atiku Abubakar. Denying Nyesom Wike a consolatory price as Vice Presidential candidate in light of the fact that he has been the major pillar of support for the PDP since it lost the presidency in 2015 , has gaslighted the party which at this point in time should have been taking advantage of the cul de sac that the difficulty in choosing a Vice Presidential candidate poses to Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu’s presidential ambition. But instead, PDP presidential candidate, Abubakar is struggling to glue together the party which currently seems to be on tenterhooks.It is rather unfortunate that a combination of the present actions and inactions of PDP leadership as well as the burden of the former president Olusegun Obasanjo, OBJ who was Atiku Abubakar’s boss , relentlessly tagging his former second-in-command as corrupt without proof,and Bloomberg’s equally excoriating report about on allegations of financial malfeasance in the USA against Turaki Abubakar,of which there is also no evidence of conviction of the crime against the PDP presidential candidate, constitute significant obstacles and impediments to PDP’s return as the ruling party at the center in 2023.Again, there is solace in the fact that Atiku Abubakar who is a veteran of several presidential contests at both the party primaries levels and as the candidate of his party in presidential elections in 2019 ,has proven to be a goal getter. In a recent press statement he has vowed to mend the broken fences within the party ,  just as the BOT chairman of the party, senator Walid Jibrin has recommended a high powered diplomacy shuttle involving both the presidential candidate and his running mate to Nyesom Wike who has been been let down by the party that he invested a lot in building in the past fifteen years. Reportedly, both the APC and Labor party are seeking his hands in political marriage.Hopefully, the need to forge a common front before 2023 by applying a healing balm on the wounds of those whose ox were gored during the vicious battle fought in the course of the party primaries would not be treated with levity by Atiku Abubakar in the manner that Goodluck Jonathan allowed the PDP to collapse in 2015, by engaging in foolish pride of not seeking rapprochement when critical stakeholders were jumping ship.All things being equal , would Turaki Atiku Abubakar be luckier this time and prevail in the impending 2023 presidential contest ?Given the prevailing political dynamics in our country whereby citizens are disdainful of the horrendous level of insecurity of lives and properties, as well as the unprecedented level of hunger and starvation stalking the land , which can best be characterized as extreme state of anomie , the presidency of Nigeria is for the PDP and Atiku Abubakar to lose, if they do or do not get their acts right early enough.And the hand writing is already on the wall if the massive defections fromAPC to PDP in Sokoto and Katsina states as well as across the country is anything to go by.Aside from the dissonances in the two major parties-the APC and PDP towards their quest for clinching the 2023 due to configuration challenges -arising from our complexities foisted by ethnic and religious differences, there is another threat.Those that the APC and PDP should be watching from their rear mirror are the Labor Party, LP, energized by ex presidential candidate of PDP who decamped, mr Peter Obi, now a wave making presidential candidate of the LP and Nigerian National Political Party, NNPP , founder and presidential candidate , Dr Musa KWAKWANSO.On their own , both parties pose no real threat. But combined ,they can constitute a real danger to both APC and PDP mission to Aso Rock Villa in 2023.To be clear, while l do not see a path way to KWAKWANSO being a running mate to Obi as being speculated , it is not impossible that both parties may agree to poll resources together in a support of either of both political party’s candidates especially for the presidential election.An even greater threat is a combination of all the opposition parties apart from the PDP against the ruling party, APC.That would be reminiscent of what happened in 2013/14 when four opposition political parties collapsed their systems into one platform-the APC which they were able to leverage in ousting the PDP after 16 years of holding sway as the ruling party at the centre.Currently , there are activities towards making such political phenomenon happen again, and it can not be discountenanced or dismissed because there is already proof of concept evidenced by the gang up and ability of APC to kick out PDP in 2015.Nothing stops that positive history from being re-enacted in 2023 because it not need to take another sixteen (16) years for it to happen.Whilst , it is not yet known whether any of the two major parties would woo the smaller parties with a view to merging with or subsuming them into their fold in the manner that the big banks took over smaller ones in the wake of banking consolidation in Nigeria in the last decade, is yet unknown , it is unlikely that any single party, APC or PDP would without coalition with other political parties rule over Nigeria from 2023. And that would be a positive development for democracy in Nigeria, since the president in 2023 would not have the sole authority to allot all the strategic positions to his kith and kins or members of same faith with him which is presently a sore point and a major reason the unity of our country is on a precipice.In the event that the party that ultimately wins the presidential contest rules in partnership with one or two smaller parties such as LP,NNPP, APGA , PRP etc, strategic posts would be shared equitably amongst the partners.That is because these micro parties which are fast developing sturdy roots in their local catchment areas -ethnic or religious enclaves would be formidable local forces, unless the behemoths like APC , PDP and to lesser extent LP and NNPP,  ahead of the 2023 presidential polls, are absorb them.All said and done , authorities should do well to define what minimum educational qualifications to be eligible to become president of Nigeria entails. During the launch of my book , Becoming President of Nigeria. A Citizen’s Guide on 10th May , the keynote speaker professor Mike Ikhariale, a constitutional lawyer noted that contrary to popular views, the minimum educational qualification for a president of Nigeria is not first school leaving certificate. But no certificate at all . All that is required is ability to comprehend and speak English language and that would be determined by INEC, not any law court.Making that clarification would spare Nigerians the anguish of constantly being faced with the question of what is the minimum educational qualifications of a presidential candidate? It is a challenge that the incumbent president Buhari’s candidacy also threw up in 2015 and 2019. I would not be surprised if that matter that dogged Buhari’s presidency is still in court. That APC candidate, Bola Tinubu is also currently being wracked by that malaise is simply because it is a nebulous rule that National Assembly,NASS can make clearer as it did with the lacuna created by not transmitting power to the Vice President when president Umaru Yar’adua of blessed memory suddenly passed away on active duty. Although, it was temporarily solved by the doctrine of necessity, it has subsequently been corrected permanently by an act of parliament which makes it automatic.By the same token , the Muslim-Muslim presidency conundrum, is also a Tinubu nightmare. That is despite Kaduna state governor, Nasir El Rufai’s experiment of that configuration in his state where both he and his deputy are Muslims.And as we all know , Kaduna state is the ground zero for ethnic and religious conflicts and the leading state in death tolls or human carnage. The tragic event in that state may likely be a direct or indirect fall out of the political configuration at the governorship level.As an antidote to the Muslim-Muslim ticket miasma, perhaps it would help If all the strategic posts such as President, Vice President, Senate President, Speaker of the House of Representatives, Chief Justice , etc were to be laid on the bargaining table . Maybe there would not be so much hullabaloo about a Muslim-Muslim presidential ticket if Christians also get lucrative posts that would checkmate aberrant behavior by the executive. That  is assuming the current polarization of our country along religious lines does not ebb but persists.Similarly, if rotation of presidency that was hashed out during the 1994/5 general SANNI Abacha convened constitutional conference were to have been embedded in the 1999 constitution by the various National Assemblies from 1999 till date ,it would not trigger the bad blood now roiling the rank and file of PDP.Curiously both the Nasir El-Rufai committee report on how the APC can move forward and the Bala Mohamed committee set by the PDP on the future of the party made recommendations on how our beloved country can experience a rebirth .How and why our leaders have chosen to ignore those monumentally useful recommendations, beats me hollow.Then again , is that not why it is often said that politics is complex?
