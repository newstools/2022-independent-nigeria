Erling Haaland says he followed his gut when signing for Manchester City. The striker was on Sunday officially presented to fans at an unveiling ceremony at the Etihad Stadium, arriving from Borussia Dortmund in a deal worth around £51million. Haaland’s signature was one of the most sought-after across the continent, with City facing stiff competition from the likes of Chelsea, Real Madrid, Bayern Munich and others. But it was City – the club his father Alf Inge previously played for – who won the race. Asked about interest from other clubs, Haaland said: “I just had the feeling in my stomach and the feeling, the way they play, everything… I had the feeling for City.” Haaland is City’s replacement for Sergio Aguero, who has been honoured with a statue outside the ground, but insists he does not feel any pressure stepping into the club icon’s shoes. Asked how he would approach the challenge he said: “Like I have been doing my whole career, try to enjoy every single minute, every moment, try not to think too much. “Overthinking is not a good thing for every human being. I just try to relax when I can and work hard.” Haaland was asked if he was the answer to City’s so-far fruitless quest for European club football’s biggest prize. POLL “I said it before, the Champions League is my favourite competition so you have the answer there,” he added. “It is a big challenge, it is a new country, a new league, new coach, new everything so it is a big challenge but I know how it is to come to a new club, I have done it a couple of times before. I am really looking forward to it.”
