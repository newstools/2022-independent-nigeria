GOMBE – Gombe State Governor Muhammadu Inuwa Yahaya has described the choice of former Governor of Borno State, Senator Kashim Shettima as running mate to APC Presidential candidate, Bola Ahmed Tinubu, as the best strategy that will guarantee a smooth victory for the party in 2023. Governor Inuwa stated this in his reaction to the choice of Shettima from the northeast adding that the running mate is a committed and loyal party man. He stated, “Shettima is a great asset to the ruling party and will add immeasurable value to the APC presidential ticket”. He also said “Asiwaju will not have made a better choice. The former Borno State Governor is a highly cerebral, eloquent, competent, courageous and cosmopolitan leader who has succeeded in building bridges, reputation and friendships across the country; and I believe he has the capacity, acumen and political sagacity to deputise the Jagaban.” While congratulating the one-time Chairman of the Northern Nigeria Governors Forum, Inuwa said, with Shettima’s background as a former lecturer, banker, agricultural economist, ex-Governor and parliamentarian with visionary and patriotic ideologies, Senator Shettima will be a ’round peg in a round hole’ as a vice president. Inuwa noted that “the Tinubu/ Shettima ticket is an excellent combination that has already given APC an upper hand and set the opposition off-balance as we approach the elections”. He reassured of his personal commitment and support of the APC in Gombe State to the Tinubu/ Shettima victory in 2023. “Gombe is a strong APC base and we shall deploy our political arsenals to ensure sweeping victory for our great party at all levels,” he emphasized.
