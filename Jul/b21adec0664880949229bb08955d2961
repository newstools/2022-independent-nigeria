LAGOS – Lagos State Police Command says it has arrested six notorious suspects behind the dastardly May 11, 2022 robbery attack on Mambillah Hotel, Owutu, Ikorodu. The police said the arrest of the suspects follows a painstaking, diligent and discreet investigation ordered and closely monitored by the Lagos State Commissioner of Police, CP Abiodun Alabi. A statement signed by the Command Spokesperson, SP Benjamin Hundeyin stated that: “The suspects who were traced to their hideout at Oju-irin Abattoir, Lagos State where they were eventually arrested include Lekan Adeoye ‘m’ aged 19, Ojo Akeredolu ‘m’ aged 29, Quadri Balogun ‘m’ aged 23, Ahmed Oke ‘m’ aged 24, John Toluwalashe ‘m’ aged 23 and Azeez Akinpelu ‘m’ aged 20. The seventh suspect, Taye was neutralized during a gun duel with police officers. Items recovered from the suspects are two locally made pistols with 11 live cartridges. It would be recalled that the armed gang invaded Mambillah Hotel, robbing guests of their valuables and shooting dead the hotel security guard in their bid to escape after the Police arrived at the scene. The earlier arrested supervisor and other staff of the hotel have since been released after further investigations cleared them of any culpability.” He added that suspects are to be arraigned in court as the investigation is currently being wound up.
