Atletico Madrid have turned down the chance to sign Cristiano Ronaldo from Manchester United, according to reports in Spain. Ronaldo is pushing to leave United before the end of the transfer window and wants to join a club who will be competing in next season’s Champions League. Ronaldo’s agent, Jorge Mendes, has already approached Chelsea and Bayern Munich about the possibility of signing the 37-year-old this summer, but both clubs have ruled out a deal. According to Spanish radio station Cope, Mendes has also met with Atletico’s CEO, Miguel Angel Gil Marin, to discuss the prospect of Ronaldo joining Diego Simeone’s side. The report claims that Mendes has informed Atletico that Ronaldo would agree to sign ‘for a modest amount’ as his focus is to continue playing Champions League football. Atletico, however, have rejected Mendes’ proposal as they are not in a financial position to sign Ronaldo from United. The Spanish club would also need to offload Alvaro Morata and Antoine Griezmann but Barcelona are unwilling to cut short the France international’s loan. Atletico will also need to pay €40 million to Barcelona if Griezmann plays at least half of their La Liga matches in the upcoming campaign. POLL Meanwhile, Erik ten Hag insists Ronaldo still has a place in his squad at United. ‘Cristiano is capable of doing that [pressing from the front]. In his career he has shown everything,’ Ten Hag said. ‘We want to play in a certain way. A top player can contribute and Ronaldo is an absolute top player in our squad.’
