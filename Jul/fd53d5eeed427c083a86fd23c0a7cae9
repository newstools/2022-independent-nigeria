The Lagos State Chapter of the All Progressives Congress (APC) has described the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) in the state as an unserious party following the nomination of Nigerian actress and film producer, Funke Akindele as the deputy governorship candidate. This was contained in a press statement issued by the party spokesperson, Seye Oladejo few hours after the 44-year-old actress confirmed her entry into politics. According to Oladejo, the opposition party was trivializing the election by “giving political neophytes who have absolutely nothing to bring to the table their electoral tickets,” adding that governance was a serious business not a cirus. “It also shows lack of depth in the party as regards quality members to put forward for elections if they could give a member who crossed-carpeted a few days before their primaries the governorship ticket and now went to the make-believe industry to fetch a deputy. “I was amused to read that the deputy governorship candidate said she was suspending her acting career for the elections whose result is highly predictable. I guess she is suspending a lot more because she has been in the news of recent for all the wrong reasons. “Lagosians will certainly not allow governance to be turned to a needless experiment or a sitcom. Governance is serious business not a circus. “Congratulations in advance to the duo of Governor Babajide SANWOOLU-olu and his deputy, Dr Obafemi Hamzat.”
