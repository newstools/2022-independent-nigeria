Chelsea’s summer transfer window is starting to heat up nicely. The Blues confirmed their first senior men’s team signing of the Boehly-Clearlake era, landing Raheem Sterling from Manchester City. It’s a huge statement of intent from Todd Boehly in the opening weeks of his ownership, telling the official website: “Raheem Sterling is a serial winner and his signing is an important step in strengthening our squad. We are delighted for Raheem to return to London with Chelsea, and we look forward to seeing his world-class talent on display at Stamford Bridge.” The additions look unlikely to stop there though, as Thomas Tuchel looks to reinforce his defensive ranks next. football.london understands advanced talks are underway to re-sign Nathan Ake from Manchester City. That’s not all though as personal terms and a fee have been agreed to land Napoli’s Kalidou Koulibaly, who has long been rumoured with a move to England. Even if those two sign, Tuchel is believed to want a third centre-back signing. It leaves question marks over some of the other options available at the club. The most pressing of those is youth prospect Levi Colwill, who enjoyed an impressive season on loan at Huddersfield last season. As a result, the 19-year-old has been linked with a move away this summer, with plenty of interest. Journalist Nizaar Kinsella reports that London rivals Arsenal are among the sides interested in a move, with four other Premier League outfits also monitoring a deal. With Colwill backed for big things, a permanent transfer could see the Blues repeat a mistake they have made on several occasions. Fikayo Tomori and Ake are examples of the team letting a youth player leave and they go on to achieve lots. It remains to be seen whether he will leave, but it could be one that comes back to bite Chelsea in the future.
