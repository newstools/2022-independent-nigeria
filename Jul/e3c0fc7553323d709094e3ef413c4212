Arsenal have officially unveiled their away kit for the 2022/23 season. The Gunners will be wearing a slick black shirt that contains three white stripes on their shoulders next term, with shorts and socks also black. The north London outfit unveiled their home strip back in May, with a similar lightning bolt design in their famous red. They revealed that £5 from every new home shirt bought directly through the club ahead of the new campaign will go to The Arsenal Foundation to support local community initiatives. “We’re extremely proud of the work we’ve been doing to bring our community together and support the lives of people in our local area for more than 35 years,” said Freddie Hudson, Head of Arsenal in the Community earlier this year. “People are the heartbeat of our community and the £5 donation from our home shirt sales will provide vital support for the local projects that serve our diverse community in north London so well. The last couple of years have been especially tough and the impact continues to be felt, but it’s amazing what we can achieve when we all come together to support each other. “We continue to draw inspiration from those who make the Arsenal family so special, and we’re thrilled to be able to give a little back in this unique way.”
