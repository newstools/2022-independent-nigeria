LAGOS – An activist and public affairs analyst, Dr. Rexkennedy Saltlove, has alerted that the 2023 general elections may be highly manipulated by some of the political parties and their candidates. Dr Saltlove, the President/Executive Director Citizens Rights and Empowerment Advocacy Initiative (CREMA Initiative), while speaking with INDEPENDENT, said that based on information arising from the recently held Ekiti State governorship election and the recent party primaries of the country’s two major political parties, the elections might be manipulated by those he termed ‘moneybags’, who are in the race. He said: “There are justifiable reasons for Nigerians to fear that the 2023 elections will be manipulated as there is always fear about elections in Nigeria, especially in 2023 with the upsurge in turn out for PVC registrations. “However, manipulations may not be successful, if the upsurge in PVCs demand is translated to real votes by citizens. “With the provision or room made for e-transmission of results, as in Section 64 of the Electoral Act, we will leverage on that to ensure that voters and polling agents sensitisation is carried out to ensure that no manipulation of result occurs at polling units or where they take place, will be minimised and reduced to the least minimum. “The INEC chairman has already said that he is comfortable with the ongoing registration and will avoid pressure since he knows he still has opportunities to go back to the university as a lecturer. “Everything rests on the nation’s leadership. We should give the chairman the benefit of doubt and trust INEC in view of the chairman’s words until after the election. But, Nigerians should do everything possible to see that they do not manipulate anything during the election.”
