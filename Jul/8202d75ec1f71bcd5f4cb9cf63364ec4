Manchester United midfielder Andreas Pereira has completed his transfer to Fulham. The newly-promoted Premier League side have signed the United academy graduate on a four-year deal and have paid an undisclosed fee to secure his services. In a statement, United wrote: “The club would like to thank Andreas for his contribution and wish him the best of luck at his new club.” On the move, Pereira said: “I’m very happy to be here and I can’t wait to start the season with Fulham. I want to help Fulham as much as I can to be where they belong. Marco Silva was very important for this. I spoke a lot with him, and he was a key factor in me being here.” Pereira has brought an end to his time at United after spending over a decade at Old Trafford. The Brazilian was signed as a youngster from PSV Eindhoven and advanced through the youth ranks at the club before making his debut in the 4-0 League Cup defeat to MK Dons in 2014. The 26-year-old continued to get opportunities in cup competitions and the occasional cameo in the Premier League but it wouldn’t be until after successive seasons on loan in Spain, at Granada and then Valencia, that he would become a more regular presence in the first team. Pereira became a regular at the beginning of Ole Gunnar Solskjaer’s reign but slipped down the midfield pecking order upon the arrival of Bruno Fernandes in January 2020. Two more loan moves, first at Lazio and then last season back in his native Brazil with Flamengo, then came next and instead of remaining at United for the final year of his contract, he has now left permanently for Fulham. He made 75 appearances for United, scoring four goals.
