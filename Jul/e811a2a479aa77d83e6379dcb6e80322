LAGOS – The Lagos State Head of Service (HoS), Hakeem Muri-Okunola, on Friday commended Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu for the improved workers’ welfare in the state, saying that the state’s workforce is more resolute at building back better from COVID-19 pandemic. Briefing journalists on the preparation for the Year 2022 Public Service Week Celebration in the Lagos State Public Service, Muri-Okunola said that the theme of the celebration: “Building Back Better from Covid-19: Enhancing Innovative Partnerships to meet the Sustainable Development Goals”, was to prepare workers for the task ahead. The HoS stated: “This year’s Public Service Week in Lagos State will thus be focusing on the role of the public institutions and the public servants in building back better from the Corona Virus pandemic. This will be done while keeping the 2030 deadline for implementing the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in focus.” He said that Lagos State will focus on the role of the public institutions and the public servants in building back better from the pandemic. Muri-Okunola reiterated Governor Sanwo-Olu’s commitment to the prioritization of staff matters, including the approval and hosting of the Public Service Week annually. He described this as a recognition of the significant contributions of public servants to the numerous achievements of the government in Lagos State. Muri-Okunola said that another important plank of the celebration is the focus on encouraging youths to pursue careers in the public sector. “Therefore, while Lagos State continues to enjoy national and international accolades as the Centre of Excellence by virtue of the high quality of its public servants in the mainstream, parastatal organizations, as well as local government and Local Council Development Areas, it is my belief that this year’s celebration should serve to refocus our minds on the changes we all must continue to make to sustain our momentum of growth and development,” he said.
