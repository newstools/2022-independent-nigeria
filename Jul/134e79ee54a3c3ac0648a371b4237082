A socio-political group, Integrity Watch, has called on the presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Atiku Abubakar to be wary of the intrigues and unpredictability of a recently sacked Managing Director of one of the electricity distribution companies. According to the political cum financial integrity watchdog, the former Disco boss was sacked for financial recklessness and other sundry offences even as Fidelity Bank took over the running of the distribution company. The group, in a statement signed by its National Coordinator, Olowobusoye Esolaye and its zonal leader, Kamilu Abubakar, have urged Alhaji Atiku not to associate with such a man, who ran the company aground and can’t be trusted based on his antecedents. Integrity Watch cited the man’s betrayal of former Governor Hashidu of Gombe State by driving him out of the All Nigerian Peoples Party (ANPP) and taking over the party and going ahead to contest the Gombe governorship in 2007. It added that the disengaged KEDCO topnotch also betrayed the PDP and Governor Dankwanbo in 2019 by pitching his tent with Governor Inuwa Yahaya, whom he has also now turned against in his desperate quest to clinch power. The statement reads in parts: “As a group (which is) interested in corporate governance, we want to use this opportunity to call on the presidential candidate of the PDP, Alhaji Atiku Abubakar to desist from frolicking with the sacked MD of KEDCO, Dr Gwamna because of his track record of betrayals. “We make bold to state that a man who ran the company aground through political patronage and is surreptitiously planning to work against the PDP ahead of the general election next year by his utterances and actions is not deemed fit to be associated with the presidential candidate. -Advertisement- POLL “We also call on ICPC and the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission to beam its searchlight on the activities of Gwamna while he held sway as Chief Executive in order to serve as a deterrent to others.”
