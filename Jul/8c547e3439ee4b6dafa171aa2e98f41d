ABUJA – A group, An Ebonyi Socio-cultural in Diaspora (AEISCID) has issued a stern warning to the state found­ing fathers and traditional rulers against alleged moves by the Gov­ernor, Dave Umahi, to arm-twist them into rotating the governor­ship position of the state on a basis other than “qualification, compe­tence and proven track records” of contestants. The group’s call followed what it described as the Governor’s “selfishness, greed and in fact, his desperation to continue to control the affairs of our dear State from behind the scene.” A statement on Monday in Abu­ja by its National President, Am­bassador Paschal Oluchukwu, also called on the people to support and vote for contestants who can turn around the fortunes of the state. The statement quoted a speech by the Governor who while ad­dressing a gathering of founding fathers of the state and other elders at the weekend insisted on the ro­tation of the Governorship to the Northern part of the state. The governor reportedly said: “I expect you all to be vocal about equity, fairness, and justice for the peace of the state. What is just is for the North to start the second circle, after the North, the central, and then the South.
