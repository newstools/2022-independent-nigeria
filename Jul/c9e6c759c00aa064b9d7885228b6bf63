An agro-allied firm, Tiger Foods Nigeria, has launched processed and packaged beans as its latest food product. The company, known for producing spices and seasonings, in a statement made available to our correspondent, stated that the newly introduced product is processed, sorted, and packaged beans free of sand, stone, and insecticide residue. They are available in 500g, 1kg and 4kg pack sizes. Mr Don Ebubeogu, the Managing Director of Tiger Foods Nigeria, while speaking on the new product, said: “Three years ago, we had a visitor from the United States of America who came to purchase dried onions and shallots from us. “After the tour of our facility, he was impressed with our modern equipment and the knowledge about food processing that we shared with him. He left us with one important request: beans “His major problems with the beans he sources from Nigeria were stones and insecticide residues. “He wanted us to package beans that will stand the test of the American Food & Drug Agency.”
