More reactions has continued to trail recent recorded interview granted to Arise Television by former vice president and presidential candidate of the People’s Democratic Party, PDP, with the latest coming coming from the Peter Obi Support Network, POSN. The group took exceptions to points raised by the candidate calling them “unsolicited and clearly erroneous political consultancy” on who may likely win the 2023 elections. POSN took exceptions to Atiku’s claim about Peter Obi, Labour Party, LP, candidate for the election of not having structure. The former vice president claimed that the Labour Party does not have any governor elected on its platform and does have LP National assembly members. “Unfortunately, the former Vice-President based his entire permutation on the assumed influence of corruption promoting and vote buying mercenaries euphemistically called political structure, and failed to consider the unassailable powers of the masses of Nigeria,” POSN said. “Alhaji Atiku Abubakar’s assertion speaks to the illusions of the fascist school of thought that believes that the masses do not matter and erroneously believes that the masses cannot think for themselves. In essence, Alhaji Atiku Abubakar is saying that Nigerians are some kind of slaves who cannot take a political decision on their own, except as imposed on them by their slave masters,” the group added.
