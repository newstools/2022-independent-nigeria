 ABUJA  – Justice Adeyemi Ajayi of High Court of the Federal Capital Terri­tory (FCT), on Friday, remanded a former Accoun­tant General of the Federa­tion, Ahmed Idris and two others in the custody of the Nigerian Correctional Ser­vice, Kuje. Justice Ajayi ordered that Idris and his co-defendants be kept in Kuje Correctional pending the hearing of their bail applications on July 27. The remand order followed the arraignment of the for­mer Accountant General by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC). The other defendants are Godfrey Olusegun Akindele, Mohammed Kudu Usman and Gezawa Commodity Mar­ket and Exchange Ltd. The Defendants are being prose­cuted on a 14-count charge of stealing and criminal breach of trust to the tune of N109, 485,572,691.9. The EFCC alleged that Ahmed Idris between Feb­ruary and December 2021 at Abuja, being a public ser­vant by virtue of his position as the Accountant General of the Federation accepted from Olusegun Akindele, a gratification in the aggregate sum of N15,136,221,921.46 ( Fifteen Billion, One Hundred and Thirty-Six Million, Two Hundred and Twenty One Thousand, Nine Hundred and Twenty One Naira and For­ty-Six Kobo) which sum was converted to the United States Dollars by the said Olusegun Akindele and which sum did not form part of his lawful re­muneration but as a motive for accelerating the payment of 13% derivation to the nine (9) oil producing Sates in the Federation, through the office of the Accountant General of the Federation, and thereby committed an offence con­trary to Section 155 of the Penal Code Act Cap 532 Laws of the Federation of Nigeria 1990 and punishable under the same section. Count eight reads, “That you, Ahmed Idris while be­ing the Accountant General of the Federation and Godfrey Olusegun Akindele while be­ing the Technical Assistant to the Accountant General of the Federation between Feb­ruary and November 2021, at Abuja in the Abuja Judicial Division of the High Court of the Federal Capital Territory, in such capacity, entrusted with a certain property, to wit: N84,390,000,000(Eighty- Four Billion, Three Hundred and Ninety Million Naira) committed criminal breach of trust in respect of the said property, when you dishon­estly received the said sum from the Federal Government of Nigeria through Godfrey Olusegun Akindele trading under the name and style of Olusegun Akindele & Co., and you thereby committed an offence punishable under Section 315 of the Penal Code Act Cap 532 Laws of the Fed­eration of Nigeria 1990”. Though, the defendants pleaded not guilty to the charges, effort of the lawyer to bail them proved abortive as Rotimi Jacobs SAN, the prosecution counsel opposed their bail applications moved by Chief Chris Uche SAN, counsel representing the 1st Defendant (Idris) and other defence lawyers. POLL Consequently, the court has adjourned to July 27, for hearing of the Defendants’ bail applications.
