LAGOS – Reports reaching the stable of Independent Newspapers indicate that Ogbeni Rauf Aregbesola, the Minister of Interior and immediate past governor of Osun State may have shunned the ongoing gubernatorial poll in the state. Speculations are rife that the minister has travelled to faraway Germany on a yet-to-be-disclosed mission. Political watchers are, however, suspecting that Aregbesola’s unexplained absence may not be unconnected with his known cold war with the incumbent governor Gboyega Oyetola who, incidentally, shares the same party (APC) membership with him. Meanwhile, the Ilesa-born minister is strongly believed to have technically shifted his loyalty, first to another faction of the APC and then to one of the current frontline gubernatorial candidates in the race.
