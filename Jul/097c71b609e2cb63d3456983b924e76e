A man in Kwara State at Lek­ki Phase 1, Eyenkorin Area of Ilorin has set his house on fire over disagreement with his wife. The incident which hap­pened on Sunday, was con­firmed by the HOD, Media and Publicity of the Kwara State Fire Service, Hassan Adekunle. He said a resident, identi­fied as Mr. Kola, summoned the service over the incident. Adekunle said the service was able to stop the fire and prevented it from escalating to other buildings in the neigh­bourhood. “What we learnt was that the man can’t remember his name now, and his wife had misunderstanding about two years ago before he relocated to another of his building, leaving the wife and children behind. “All attempts to settle the matter did not yield results and the move to also convince him to allow the wife and chil­dren live there since he had another house also failed. “According to the report, the man suddenly appeared on Sunday and sprayed the three bedrooms flat with pet­rol before setting it ablaze with the children inside that his wife was frustrating him.” He said it took the inter­vention of the resident who reported the incident and others for the occupants to be rescued.
