‘The youth of any nation are the trustees of posterity,’ as amplified by a world-renowned American writer, Benjamin Disraeli. Perhaps these pungent words could be the reason(s) why many youths of today are taking up sensitive responsibilities in every sphere of the nation’s life, especially politics. Pragmatic Hon. Ogunsakin, a formidable player in Ekiti politics, is still basking in the euphoria of his new assignment as Ekiti PDP chairman. A bridge-builder, the former deputy guber candidate and former Ado-Ekiti local government boss, will no doubt breadth a new lease of life into the crisis-ridden party in the state. Trust the debonair, a very resourceful and deeply grass-rooted politician; he will surely bring everything within his political sagacity and mend-fencing tactics garnered over the years to stabilise the PDP in the state for the future political onslaughts. Deji in his 40s may well pass to be the youngest state party chair in the southwest; just as he treats everyone with equanimity and unfettered listening ears. The Ado Ekiti-born erstwhile economist and banker, is a graduate of Economics from Ekiti State University, Ado Ekiti, with a Masters in Business Administration from the University of Lagos.
