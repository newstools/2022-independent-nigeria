An Onitsha-based educationist and proprietor, Akunne Oniah Group of Schools, Onitsha, Chief Jude Oniah has lamented the continued strike action embarked upon by lecturers in the nation’s public universities. Chief Oniah who spoke to our correspondent in Onitsha at the weekend said that the over three months of strike action by university lecturers under its umbrella association, ASUU has made the country a laughing stock in the international community. Chief Oniah who is a member of the prestigious Agbalanze Society, Onitsha stated that the nonchalant attitude of the Federal Government over the issue of the ASUU Strike has portrayed the nation’s leaders as insensitive and incompetent to manage affairs of the country. The educationist, however, cautioned that the continued stay at home by what he described as “deprived Nigerian university students could spell doom for the country. On why the Federal Government has continued to encourage the strike action by not listening to ASUU grievances, Chief Oniah posited that the inability of the Federal Government to consider the agreement reached with ASUU was not unconnected with the political leaders having their children studying abroad where education is highly appreciated by the authorities. He said it was shameful that Nigerian politicians were frequently travelling and sending their children abroad to developed countries to acquire university education, while the children of the poor are left in the country to study in a severe environment which encourages a series of strikes. He called on the Federal Government to dump its pride and save the nation’s university education and her citizens by conceding to ASUU demand which the Federal Government had earlier entered an agreement with the union.
