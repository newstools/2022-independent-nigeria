A former aide to ex-Nigerian president Goodluck Jonathan, Reno Omokri, has reacted to an attack on the Kuje Prisons in the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) by terrorists on Tuesday. Naija News had earlier reported that a group of terrorists stormed the Medium Custodial Centre and bombed sections of the facility, letting some criminals escape. The terrorist according to reports invaded the federal facility around 10.30 pm. The gunmen who bombarded the facility and successfully operated for about one hour unhindered reportedly freed Boko Haram inmates at the correctional centre. Reacting to the development, Omokri via his Twitter account bemoaned the state of the nation and queried its leadership. He tweeted: “Unknown Gunmen have gotten to Abuja? And they helped Boko Haram members escape from Kuje prison? What has Nigeria become? Is anyone in charge of this country? And when Gov Ortom said bandits could overrun Aso Rock and Abuja on Channels, he was almost yanked off air! “How will any government keep high-profile terrorists in a medium-security prison? It makes no sense and is a dereliction of duty. America keeps al-Qaeda and Islamic State prisoners in Guantanamo Bay. These guys should have been at Ita Oko under heavy military guard!.”
