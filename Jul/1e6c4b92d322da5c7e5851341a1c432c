ONITSHA  – Allegation of corruption and embezzlement of market funds levelled against the immediate past Caretaker Committee chairman of Onitsha Grain Seeds Market, Chief Charles Ikegwuonu, has been dismissed by a cross-section of traders in the market. The immediate past chairman of the market was accused by some traders in the market of spending traders’ funds put in his care for the running of market affairs. He was also accused of arbitrary spending running into several millions of naira. However, when our correspondent visited the market last weekend, Ikegwuonu denied all the allegations levelled against him. He narrated how he served the market and the traders to the best of his ability. He revealed that the market hall, which was abandoned by last administration in the market, was refurbished with modern tiles, while adequate security was restored to the market among other achievements. Our correspondent gathered from a few traders at the grain seeds market that Ikegwuonu’s administration brought about development and transparency in the foodstuffs market. Mr. Ebuka Odinaka, a tomato trader at Onitsha Grain Seeds Market, told our correspondent that lkegwuonu’s only “sin” was the inability of the embattled chairman to squander traders’ funds with his detractors. -Advertisement- POLL Mrs. Ginika lfediora, an okra seller in the market, explained that there was progress in the market during the administration of the former market boss and urged the new Chairman, Mr. Chijioke Okpala, to exhibit quality leadership by reactivating the abandoned borehole during his brief stay as chairman of the market. Onitsha Grain Seeds Market was a few years ago engulfed in crisis when a few members of the market Board of Trustees (BOT) attempted to convert the market to private property, which incidentally resulted into series of court actions in favour of traders.
