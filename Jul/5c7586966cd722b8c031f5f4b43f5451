Shehu Sani, former Kaduna Central Senator, has alleged vote-buying in the ongoing governorship election in Osun State. According to him, some residents of Osun State are reportedly demanding money before voting. He, however, warned that money would prevent the emergence of a good leader. Sani tweeted, “The Osun residents reportedly demanded money before voting. Money is the temptation that will stand in between the electorates and their dream of a good leadership and a better country.”
