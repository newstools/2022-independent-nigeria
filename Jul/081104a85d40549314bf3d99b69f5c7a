Cristiano Ronaldo reportedly won’t join a club where he is the sole focus of the attack – even if they’re in the Champions League. The 37-year-old is believed to want out at Old Trafford, and he’s requested to leave Manchester United should a suitable offer come in. A big reason for wanting to leave United comes down to the lack of Champions League football. However, CBS journalist Ben Jacobs has now tweeted: “Sources close to Ronaldo say he’s keen to not only play #UCL but join a club where he feels [the] burden of output isn’t solely on him. “He wants support, which he believes is key to maintaining his peak. This is particularly important in a World Cup year with added games mid-season.” However, Ronaldo’s options are diminishing with teams wary of his mega-wages at Old Trafford. Chelsea had seemed to be the most interested in his services, but the Blues have since cooled their interest in the Portuguese megastar. Ronaldo is yet to reunite with his United team-mates as he didn’t join the side for their pre-season tour of Thailand and Australia. Ahead of United’s friendly with Aston Villa – at the Optus Stadium, Perth – Erik ten Hag was asked if there was an update on Ronaldo’s future. The Dutchman replied: “No [update]. It’s the same as last week.”
