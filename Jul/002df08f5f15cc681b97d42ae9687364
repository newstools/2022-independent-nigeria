Akwa Ibom State Police Command has declared a roadside petrol dealer in Obio Akpa wanted for setting ablaze an undergraduate of the State University. The suspect, now at large reportedly fled the scene of the crime after setting the victim identified as Enwongo Akpan, a 200-level student in the Department of Philosophy at Akwa Ibom State University (AKSU) on fire after an argument with him. It was gathered that the victim bought N500 petrol from the suspect and later suspected it was adulterated as it failed to start his generator. The victim, however, returned the petrol to the dealer and demanded a refund of his money but the suspect started arguing with him. An eyewitness told Daily Post that in the course of the argument, the dealer collected the petrol, poured it on the victim and struck matches on him adding that people around scampered for safety. He added that the victim was later rescued by villagers and students who alerted the Vice-Chancellor of the University, Prof Nse Essien who directed immediately that the victim be taken to Mercy Hospital in Abak for immediate treatment. His words, “The incident attracted the attention of community leaders such as former Chairman of OrukAnam Prince Ubong Idiong who prevailed on students to forestall reprisal action by students of the University. “The victim was later transferred to another hospital in Uyo for better treatment.”However, the Police Public Relations Officer in the State, SP Odiko Macdon in a telephone call said the police is trailing the suspect and would soon arrest him. POLL According to him, “Yes we are aware of the incident. The suspect escaped from the scene of the crime before police arrived for arrest. Police is trailing the suspect now and he will soon be brought to book.”
