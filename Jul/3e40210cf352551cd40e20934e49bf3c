President Joe Biden has said that the United States “will not walk away” from the Middle East as he tries to ensure stability in a volatile corner of the globe and boost the worldwide flow of oil to reverse rising gas prices. His remarks, delivered on Saturday at the Gulf Cooperation Council as he closes out the final leg of a four-day trip, come as the region braces for a potential confrontation with Iran. “We will not walk away and leave a vacuum to be filled by China, Russia or Iran,” Biden told Arab leaders. “We will seek to build on this moment with active, principled, American leadership.” Although US forces continue to target terrorists in the region and remain deployed at bases throughout the Middle East, Biden suggested that he was turning the page after the country’s invasions of Iraq and Afghanistan. “Today, I’m proud to be able to say that the eras of land wars in the region, wars that involved huge numbers of American forces, is not under way,” he said. “The future will be won by the countries that unleash the full potential of their populations,” he said, including allowing people to “question and criticize leaders without fear of reprisal.”
