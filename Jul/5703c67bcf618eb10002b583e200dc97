LAGOS  – The La Casera Company in partnership with KARIS Family Development Initiative has implemented a Prevention of Drugs and Drug Literacy initiative to sensitise Middle School Children at District Junior College, Agege on the devastating effects of drugs to their health and their future, as part of activities to mark the United Nations World Day Against Drug Abuse and Illicit Drug Trafficking 2022. The International Day against Drug Abuse and Illicit Trafficking or World Drug Day is marked on 26 June every year to strengthen action and cooperation in achieving the goal of a world free of drug abuse. Themed, “Addressing Drug Challenges in Health and Humanitarian Crises” this year, the global event highlights the physical and psychological impact of substance abuse, drug overdose, and drug-related humanitarian crises to eliminate the menace from our society. Ms. Angela Bekederemo , Founder, KARIS Family Development Initiative, and a licensed Clinical Social Worker, acknowledged that the annual event spreads awareness about the dangers of drug abuse not just among adults but also among children. She noted that the objective of the initiative is to prevent early initiation of substance or drug use, delay use, and prevent disorders for students who are already dependent on drugs. “Whether we like it or not drug is readily available in our society and to prevent our children and young adults from delving into such, we sensitize them on the dangers of taking drugs and equip them with skills that enable them to develop a repulsive attitude so as not to do drugs. “We thank The La Casera Company for partnering with us to prevent this menace and we admonish the Nigerian Government to invest more into prevention intervention programmes like this because currently the UNODC is the one doing it on behalf of the government and the reason they are doing it is to get the Nigerian government to key into this initiative as treatment does not come cheap. “Prevention is much less expensive unlike treatment, so it will be great for our government to allocate funds for prevention education for secondary school children because for every one dollar invested in prevention you save 10 dollars in substance use disorder”.
