LAGOS  – The Managing Director at Afro-Asian Insurance Services, Ryan Phillips has said that African insurance brokers are supporting the industry across the continent by driving innovation, and are also contributing towards the sustainability of the sector. Speaking at just concluded 48th African Insurance Organisation (AIO) conference held in Niarobi, Kenya, Phillips who is a signatory to the Nairobi Declaration on Sustainable Insurance, said brokers have a key role not just in helping to design products to cope with climate change but also on the governance, support clients as they strive to maintain compliance with changing rules and regulations. “I do feel that ESG is important – we all want a world for our children and grandchildren – but fairness is important too. Being an African broker there is a bit of conflict between the E (environment) and the S (social) when it comes to natural resources, which they are just exploring and finding at the moment. “From a European perspective, particularly from the investment side, investors don’t want to go down that route – they won’t invest in Africa because of ESG. But we all know about the load shedding and the power cuts and Africa doesn’t have the same access to power and energy as we do. Sometimes there is a push from Europeans for Africa to skip their natural resources and jump straight to renewables.” He added: “Africa’s emissions are probably about 1per cent so is it fair for the West to ask Africa to skip those natural resources because the West has exhausted its supplies and is looking at renewables?
