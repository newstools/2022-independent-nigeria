ENUGU – The citizens of Enugu state have expressed mixed reactions as the former Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) gubernatorial aspirant, Hon Chijioke Edeoga emerged as the new Labour Party governorship candidate in the state. It could be recalled that Edeoga, the immediate past commissioner for environment in Enugu State was among the 17 aspirants that contested for the last primary election in the state but while 8 of out of the 17 aspirants stepped down for Peter Mba who is currently the PDP flag bearer, Edeoga contested the election and lost to Mba as he got 9 votes. While some people described Edeoga emergence as Labour Party candidate as a good omen to the party and the people of the state other analysts believed it was against the electoral law as they argued he would have stepped down before the election as 8 others did rather than participating and lost. The name Edeoga who hailed from Isi Uzo Local Government Area was prominent as Ugwuanyi Successor in the build up to the primary election until the recent emergence of Peter Mba as the PDP flag bearer. The news of Edeoga’s emergence of Labour Party guber candidate filtered over the weekend and this was confirmed by Edeoga on sunday morning saying “yes, it’s true. I’m now the Labour Party governorship candidate.” Meanwhile Labour Party has described Edeoga’s emergence as the begining of a politcial revolution in the state. According to Oji-River Local Government Chairman of the Labour Party Ginger Ibeneme said the party has got a rallying point in Edeoga. “We got a rallying point. Edeoga has experience in the act of governance having worked in government,”.
