AWKA – A People’s Democratic Party (PDP) governorship aspirant for the 2023 governorship election in Abia State, Mr Ndubuisi Etugo Ogah, has said that he rejected the eventual winner of the party’s candidate, Professor Uche Ikonne because the selection process went against the rules. Ogah, chairman of Etugo Oil and Gas who addressed supporters in his office in Awka said he dragged both Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) and his party to court to defend the zoning and rotation of governorship seat reached as ‘Abia Charter of Equity and endorsed by the founding fathers of the State. Ogah explained that going by the said arrangement, it is the turn of Abia North Senatorial Districts to produce the next Governor of Abia State in 2023 and that runs contrary to the choice of Professor Ikonne who is from Abia Central Senatorial District and for that reason ahe is not acceptable. Oga noted  that zoning and rotation of power under the Charter of Equity is as old as Abia State and well known among the quarters that make up the State namely: Afikpo, Bende, Isikwuato and Aba with Afikpo producing the first elected governor in the person of Ogbonnaya Onu before Afikpo was ceded to Ebonyi State when Ebonyi was created He said that Abia North produced Governor Orji Uzor Kanu when democracy returned in 1999 under the same arrangement of zoning and rotation of power with Theodore Orji from Abia Central accordingly taking over from Kalu as Governor in 2007 to ensure a smooth run of the Charter of Equity. He stated, “There was an attempt to truncate the Chatter of Equity in 2015 by a group called Save Abia Group among other people individually and collectively but Theodore Orji as incumbent Governor stood his ground to defend it and ensured that Abia South produced the Governor in 2015 in the person of Okezie Ikpeazu after himself from Abia Central took over from Kalu from North. “What I am saying is that we should not allow them to destroy the Charter of Equity by bringing somebody from Abia Central at this point in time when it is clear that it is the turn of Abia North through Isikwuato and Umunneochi quarters to produce the Governor of Abia State. This is why I took PDP and INEC to court to stop them from fielding Professor Ikonne as the governorship candidate for PDP. Maintaining that he is in the Court to defend the Charter of Equity as agreed and endorsed by the founding fathers he called on Abia stakeholders to see the reason to copy Anambra, Enugu and other states that are having the smooth-running of zoning of the PDP and support the agitation to uphold the zoning in Abia State.
