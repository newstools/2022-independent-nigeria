Kalidou Koulibaly was Juventus‘ No.1 target to replace Giorgio Chiellini, but with the Napoli star off to Chelsea, the Old Lady must look elsewhere for defensive reinforcements. Koulibaly is expected to complete a €40m switch to Stamford Bridge today. He has already agreed personal terms with the Premier League giants who will finalise an agreement with Napoli today. The 30-year-old was Max Allegri’s first option to replace Giorgio Chiellini who has joined LAFC, but Koulibaly’s imminent move to Chelsea means Juventus must change their plans. Sources told Football Italia that Arsenal’s Gabriel is the Old Lady’s priority target now, but the Gunners won’t sell for less than €30m. Fiorentina‘s Nikola Milenkovic is available for €15m and Villarreal’s Pau Torres is also on the Bianconeri’s agenda; the same goes for Torino centre-back Gleison Bremer. However, the Granata’s president Urbano Cairo warned suitors on Tuesday that the Brazilian centre-back could be worth as much as Milan Skriniar, so circa €70m. Monaco’s Benoît Badiashile and Borussia Dortmund’s Manuel Akanji have been linked with a move to Juventus, but the Bianconeri are looking for more experienced players, considering that Matthijs de Ligt may also leave the club, having already agreed personal terms with Bayern Munich. Juventus have rejected the Bavarians’ opening bid for the Dutch defender, €60m plus add-ons, and have demanded at least €90m to sell their star.
