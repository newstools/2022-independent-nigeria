The Jigawa Chapter of the National Commercial and Motorcycle Owners’, Riders’ Association of Nigeria (NATOMORAS) has expressed dismay at the Federal Government’s planned plot to ban Okada nationwide. Sounding the note of warning was the Jigawa State Secretary of the association, Mal. Ya’u  Mohammed  Rungumau during a chat with Daily Independent in Dutse. He described such a move as inhumane, and a violation of the citizens’ fundamental human rights to earn a living through their little efforts of Okada riding. According to Mal. Yau the consequences of the proposed ban will not augur well for the country as it will generate an increase in crime wave, unemployment, and hardships of different dimensions. “Okada is a semi-employment opportunity formed by productive people of different backgrounds purposely to earn a living with their families. Therefore for govt to ban its operations is more or less killing them and their dependants” For example, here in Jigawa State, we have in our records over 150,000 registered members with a lot of dependants under them for daily needs. Such needs include food, shelter, medication, schooling, and house rents etc, asking with the current move, coupled with the current economic hardship, how will such people feel about this disturbing phenomenon?”; he asked. If the government bans Okada, will they provide an alternative to those concerned in form of gainful employment?”; Rungumau questioned.
