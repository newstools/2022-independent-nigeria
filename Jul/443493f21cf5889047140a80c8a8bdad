 There has been renewed hope in finding the cure for Human Immune Virus (HIV) as a new study from Tel Aviv University proposes a novel AIDS treat­ment that could be turned into a vaccine or a one-time treatment for people living with the virus. A report on Friday confirm­ing the breakthrough cure not­ed that the research explored modifying type B white blood cells in the patient’s body to release anti-HIV antibodies in response to the virus. Dr. Adi Barzel, and Ph.D. student, Alessio Nehmad led the study, which was con­ducted in partnership with the Sourasky Medical Centre (Ichilov), the George S. Wise department of life sciences, and the Dotan Center for Ad­vanced Therapies. The study was carried out in cooperation with other re­searchers from Israel and the United States. The findings were published recently in the renowned journal Nature Biotechnology. The lives of many people living with AIDS have im­proved during the past two decades as a result of the ad­ministration of medicines that have transformed the condition from fatal to chronic. However, the report says, “We have a long way to go be­fore finding a medication that can offer patients a permanent cure. Dr. Barzel’s laboratory pi­oneered one feasible method, a one-time injection. His team devised a technology that em­ploys type B white blood cells that are genetically altered within the patient’s body to re­lease neutralizing antibodies against the HIV virus, which causes the disease. B cells are white blood cells that produce antibod­ies against viruses, bacteria, and other pathogens. Bone marrow is where B cells are formed. When they mature, B cells move into the blood and lymphatic system and from there to the different body parts.
