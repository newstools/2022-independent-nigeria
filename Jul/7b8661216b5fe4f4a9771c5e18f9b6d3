Edu has told Lyon midfielder Lucas Paqueta that Arsenal are ready to make a move for him this summer, according to reports in Brazil. The Brazil international was one of Lyon’s star performers last season with nine goals and six assists in Ligue 1. The Gunners have already strengthened Mikel Arteta’s midfield options with the £34 million signing of Fabio Vieira from Porto last month. But according to Goal Brazil, Arsenal are also interested in signing Paqueta and Edu has told the midfielder’s representatives that they want to make a formal offer before the end of the window. The report claims that Lyon are holding out for a €80 million (£67.6m) and Arsenal are keeping tabs on Paqueta’s situation. Newcastle United have also been linked with a move for the 24-year-old but have not submitted an offer. Speaking at the weekend, Lyon president Jean-Michel Aulas revealed that Paqueta has already attracted interest this summer. ‘There are proposals for him,’ said Aulas. POLL ‘There are certain players who can feel complete in the project, and others who don’t. ‘Economically, we have the means to pursue our ideas and objectives. ‘The coach gave us his opinion and there is also what the players wants to do.’
