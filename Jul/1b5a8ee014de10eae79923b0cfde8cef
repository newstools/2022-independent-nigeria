Erling Haaland has revealed that Ole Gunnar Solskjaer sent him a good luck message following his transfer to Manchester City. The 21-year-old moved to the Etihad Stadium last month after the Premier League champions met his £51million release clause at Borussia Dortmund. It is the latest chapter in a meteoric rise for Haaland, who made his professional debut for hometown club Bryne in the Norwegian second tier at the age of 15. Nine months later, the striker moved to top-flight side Molde – managed at the time by Solskjaer Solskjaer is of course a Manchester United legend – despite the way his managerial reign at Old Trafford ended – so he couldn’t resist a cheeky dig when Haaland made the switch to City. ‘When I signed with City he congratulated me and wrote to me “Good luck on going to the wrong side of Manchester”, Haaland told the Manchester Evening News. ‘We talk sometimes. As you know, he had a huge impact on my career when I was at Molde. He’s a good guy.’ Haaland moved from Molde to Red Bull Salzburg in 2019 and around the same time it was reported that Solskjaer’s United were keen on signing him. POLL The 6ft 5in frontman ended up moving on to Borussia Dortmund, where he established himself as one of the hottest players in Europe. He insists that he has no regrets about any of his career choices. ‘Three years ago City didn’t want me because they had [Sergio] Aguero up front so then there was no choice about coming to Man City,’ Haaland said. ‘Basically, my feeling was I felt more going to the other place than coming here to England. I could have come here a lot of times in my career but I felt the other place and I think it was a really good choice. ‘I have made perfect choices ever since I went to Molde, then Salzburg and Dortmund. I’m not complaining about that.’
