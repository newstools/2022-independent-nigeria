This woman of substance proves time and time again, especially at the beginning of every July, around the time of her birthday that she’s really one to reckon with. For 2022, Toyin Kolade has insisted on following her annual tradition of sharing merriment and meal with the underprivileged in commemoration of her birthday. By all standards, Chief Toyin Kolade is a successful businesswoman and socialite of note. For Iyalaje Oodua, she is one of the top players in the Nigerian business circle. Her exciting journey would certainly inspire anyone who wants to succeed as an entrepreneur with interests in many sectors including maritime, oil and gas, furniture, real estate, and hospitality. No doubt, it takes a woman of guts as Kolade to thrive in the ever-unpredictable business climate in Nigeria. Kolade, unarguably, commands huge respect from young and old, especially in the political, social and business circles that have seen her as an inspiration. On Wednesday, July 13, Kolade, the Managing Director of Fisolak Global Resources, added a new age to her chequered life. Trust as the ebullient socialite and woman of means; she makes the day a celebration of life as she hosts select family members and friends to a lavish feast at the Marriott Hotel, Ikeja GRA, Lagos. Described as brainy, confident and intelligent, many eulogised the vivacious businesswoman for all her good deeds and abiding principles. Earlier in the day, the Iyalaje Oodua had shown her appreciation to God with thanksgiving as well as sharing food items and cash with the less privileged to mark the occasion.
