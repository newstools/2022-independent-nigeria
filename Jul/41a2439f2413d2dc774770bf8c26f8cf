There is no doubt that in the volatile financial services sector, the banking giant, United Bank for Africa (UBA) plays a dominant and front-line role among its peers. With a vast network of branches in the country and in virtually all the continents of the world, the widely celebrated financial services provider just add-up to its global network in Dubai, United Arabs Emirate, with the opening of yet another outlet in the rich commercial nerve centre and tourists’ destination. Declaring the Dubai branch open, the chairman of the bank, Tony Elumelu, promised to add more and better banking products and services from the bank stable, given the uniqueness and vantage positions the Arab country eminently occupies in the core areas of commerce and tourism. With these new exploits, the enigmatic and upwardly mobile financial guru and philanthropist, has pulled another stunt. Ever since he swerved into the banking industry over three decades ago, he has continued to remain a recurring decimal after years of leaving his active banking and financial services occupation. Yes, Anthony Elumelu is quintessential in all ramifications, and this is no hyperbole. Today, even with the flourishing achievement of UBA Group, he has been breaking new grounds on many fronts, chief of which are philanthropy, charity, youth empowerment and sundry CSR initiatives.
