Paris Saint-Germain director Antero Henrique met Inter’s management yesterday to discuss a deal for Milan Skriniar, where it was made clear that there wouldn’t be any discounts. The Nerazzurri are willing to cash in on the 27-year-old Slovakian centre back this summer in order to generate some funds and give them the resources needed to close out a deal for Torino star Gleison Bremer. Skriniar’s contract expires with the Milanese club next year, so now’s the time to sell. As reported by Gianluca Di Marzio, Henrique met with Inter’s management yesterday to discuss an offer for Skriniar. PSG are very keen to pick up the 27-year-old but they’ll have to pay full price if they want to secure his signature, with the Nerazzurri making it clear that they wouldn’t offer any discounts. Corriere della Sera suggests that a final deal could be reached in the region of €70m plus add-ons, more than enough for the Milanese club to close out a deal for Torino’s Bremer.
