Ogun State Governor, Dapo Abiodun, has tasked members of the Association of Feto-Maternal Medicine Specialists in Nigeria, on the need to come up with medical solutions capable of reducing maternal and infant mortality rate in the country. Abiodun stated this while receiving members of the association led by its President, ProfessorSaturday Etuk, on acourtesy call in his office at Oke-Mosan, Abeokuta, on Wednesday. He noted that as an important branch in the medical field that deals with issues relating to pregnant women and their unborn children, the association should be given all the needed attention it deserves. “I must say that the world and the society at large owe a lot to you because that is the beginning of life. But for the sacrifices and the commitment of people like you, we won’t be where we are anywhere in the world. “The pressure statistics you reeled out to us are due to the efforts and dedication of people like yourselves who continue to come up with practices to ensure that we have more people that are surviving maternal care or more children that are not still born”, the governor added.
