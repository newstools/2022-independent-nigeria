LAGOS – The Pension Transitional Arrangement Directorate (PTAD), has successfully held the maiden edition of a sensitization and training programme on the “I AM ALIVE” Confirmation Solution, organised for Pension Union Executives and Pension Desk Officers of Ministries, Departments and Agencies of pensioners who retired under the Defined Benefit Scheme (DBS). The event which was recently organised by the agency in Abuja with over 300 participants from the North East, North West and North Central in attendance was earlier launched as a pilot programme for 5,000 pensioners in 2021. Dr Chioma Ejikeme, the Executive Secretary, in her welcome address, said “You may recall that PTAD launched the “I AM ALIVE” Confirmation Solution in October 2021 as a pilot program for 50,000 pensioners. At the launch, we explained the purpose and focus of the “I AM ALIVE” Confirmation Solution. We premised our justification on the need for PTAD to continuously update its pensioner database as a means of ascertaining verified pensioners that are alive and should continue to receive their monthly pension. We explained that the pilot program was intended to test the applicability, ease of usage and user-adaptation of the solution, following which final adjustments would be made before deployment across the nation for all our pensioners. The training programme taking place this week is therefore for this primary purpose – to ensure that our Union Executives and Pension Desk Officers can use this “I Am Alive” Confirmation solution without any difficulty; that they can assist our pensioners in understanding how to use the application, and that they can respond to basic enquiries and questions about the confirmation process. The training has been organized to first give an understanding of why we are deploying “I AM ALIVE”, what we expect as the impact and benefits to be derived, and what we see as likely challenges. We will also explain the role we believe that Union Executives and Pension Desk Officers should play.
