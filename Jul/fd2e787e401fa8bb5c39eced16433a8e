Savannah Energy Plc, the British independent energy company, says its subsidiary, Accugas Limited, has commenced gas sales to TransAfam Power Limited (TAPL) in relation to the provision of gas for use at its power plants in Rivers State, Nigeria. Savannah had last month signed an interruptible gas sales agreement (GSA) with TAPL to supply up to 35 MMscfpd daily for an initial three-month period, with the option to extend for a mutually agreed period. The plant is connected to the Accugas network via the Nigerian Gas Company pipeline from Ikot Abasi. Andrew Knott, CEO, Savannah Energy, while speaking on the development, said: “I am delighted to report we have already begun first gas sales to TAPL, having signed an agreement at the beginning of this month. This will be the third customer we have commenced new gas supply to in the past month. We have now signed and operationalised GSAs with power plants comprising around 24% of the country’s thermal generation capacity (up from 14% at the same time last year) demonstrating our dedication to the Nigerian industry and being the energy partner of choice.” Vincent Ozoude, MD/CEO, TransAfam Power Limited, expressed pleasure that the gas supply from Accugas Limited to the company’s plant has commenced,adding that the development will support in boosting the plant capacity recovery programme and improving power generation to the country. Mrs Owen Omogiafo, the President, Transcorp Group, said: “The commencement of the gas supply by Accugas Limited to our subsidiary TransAfam is in line with our strategic intent of increasing power generation in Nigeria, noting the role of energy in the nation’s development. We remain committed to optimising our installed capacities across our various plants, as leaders in the sector.”
