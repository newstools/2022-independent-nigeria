Following his decision to settle for a Muslim-Muslim ticket, the Presidential candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Asiwaju Bola Tinubu has met with the General Overseer of the Redeemed Christian Church of God (RCCG), Pastor Enoch Adeboye. It could be recalled that controversy had trailed the decision of the former Governor of Lagos State to pick a fellow Muslim, Kashim Shettima, former Governor of Borno State as running mate in the 2023 general elections which were against the clamour of several Nigerians. Tinubu met with Adeboye on Sunday at the Redemption Camp alongside his wife, Senator Oluremi Tinubu who is a deputy pastor in the church and other associates. Daily Independent gathered that Tinubu set up a team of eminent persons with whom he was scheduled to meet the Christian leaders within the party and faith-based organisations like the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN), Pentecostal Fellowship of Nigeria (PFN) and the Catholic, to appeal to them and secure their buy-in. A source in the Tinubu Campaign team, who pleaded anonymity, informed This Day that the plan, which was going to be a holistic approach to the crisis, was to make the Christian community see the reasons behind the Muslim-Muslim ticket, adding that Tinubu decided to lead a team to appeal the Christian community. But THISDAY yesterday gathered that the meeting with Adeboye was actually held on Sunday at the Redemption camp. A reliable source, who also pleaded anonymity said that the meeting with  Adeboye was very fruitful, adding that the clergy was not against a Muslim-Muslim ticket. “He met Adeboye on Sunday. The meeting was very fruitful. Adeboye is not against Muslim-Muslim ticket,” a source told ThisDay. POLL However, efforts to confirm the meeting from Tinubu’s Media Aide, Tunde Rahman, failed as he did not respond to a text message sent to him.
