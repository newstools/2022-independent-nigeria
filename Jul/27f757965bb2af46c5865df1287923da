AKURE – Bamidele Omosehin has called on Muslim faithful in Nigeria and Ondo State, in particular, to pray for the country while they celebrate the Eid-el-Kabir. He said the current insecurity in Nigeria demands the cooperation of all and divine intervention, thereby calling on Muslims to remember the nation and pray for peace as they celebrate Eid. Congratulating Muslims in Ondo South Senatorial district and the state at large, Omosehin implored youths to ensure they celebrate the festivity with all sense of modesty. The philanthropist, who had through his foundation, Bamidele Omosehin Foundation (BOF), organized free healthcare services, sporting programmes, including football, and presented different prizes to participants in the games in the Ondo South Senatorial district said the joy of the celebration should not be about merry making alone as the country yearns for concerted prayers of the faithful. Omosehin said: “The current security situation in the country requires serious cooperation among the citizenry and divine intervention. “I want to appeal to our Muslim brothers and sisters to remember our nation in their prayers when they get to the Eid Ground on Salah day. “The way innocent citizens are being killed virtually every day by terrorists calls for serious concern. “Let us pray for peace to return to our nation. This will allow investors to find our country a good destination to invest their money and the rate of unemployment would reduce drastically and many job opportunities would be created. -Advertisement- POLL “I wish all Muslim faithful in Ondo South and in Ondo State a happy celebration.
