Atalanta are continuing talks with Arsenal for Nuno Tavares on loan and approached RB Leipzig for Ademola Lookman, claim Sky Sport Italia. According to Gianluca Di Marzio, La Dea are working on a revamp of their wings going into the new season. Left-back Nuno Tavares is looking for more regular playing time and Arsenal are prepared to let him leave on loan, but Atalanta are also trying to negotiate a purchase option for the 22-year-old Portuguese talent. They are also showing interest in left-sided attacking winger Lookman, who is under contract with RB Leipzig until June 2024. He spent last season on loan at Leicester City, while before that he spent time at Fulham and Everton. Born in London, but playing his international football for Nigeria, Lookman can also play on the right or as a support striker. The 24-year-old scored eight goals and provided five assists in 42 competitive games for Leicester last season, impressing in the Conference League against Roma.
