Mainland Lions Club, District 404B2 Nigeria, has renovated a staff room and donated fur­niture including a new set of office tables and chairs to the Mainland Senior Secondary School, Jibowu. Lion Sowande Olufemi, the President of the club who led the donation team noted that the gesture was to improve the learning environment in the school, being part of the needs of the school. Olufemi said, “In Lionism we believe that where there is a need, you will always see a Lion coming in to take care of those needs. “When we came into Main­land Senior School, we looked at the staff office and we no­ticed some office tables and chairs and the whole office in a state of disrepair. We felt that the teachers that are giving out lectures and imparting knowl­edge to the children need to be comfortable at least so that the more comfortable they are will determine their output and the students will be the ultimate beneficiary and the society at large. That was what really prompted us to do something; at least the community which we serve will be the ultimate beneficiary of the project.” “Since Mainland Senior Secondary School is within the jurisdiction of Mainland Lions Club, we saw that the school is a community within our ju­risdiction, then we decided to come into the school and see their need.” The Principal of Mainland Senior Secondary School, Mr. Oduntan Adeniji, commended the Lions Club for their gesture.
