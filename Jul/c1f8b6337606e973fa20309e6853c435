The presidential candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Asiwaju Bola Tinubu’s Campaign Organization has outrightly denied the news report making the rounds that fake bishops were hired to attend the official unveiling of Kashim Shettima as the vice presidential candidate in the 2023 general elections. Daily Independent had on Wednesday reported that Tinubu officially unveiled Senator Shettima, a Northern Muslim as his running mate amid controversy surrounding the same fate ticket. The footage of some unpopular Christian clergymen and women who dressed in cassocks like Catholic bishops at the APC unveiling has been alleged to be fake bishops and it’s currently trending on all social media platforms. Sighting the viral footage, the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) had in a statement issued on Wednesday disowned the bishops, saying they were not known bishops and have no church, challenging the party to reveal the names of the fake bishops and the church they are pastoring. Reacting to the development, Tinubu Campaign Organization through its Director of Media and Communication, Mr Bayo Onanuga said the bishops were not hired, adding that the clerics are patriotic Nigerians who believe in the unity of the country, stressing that they (bishops) are not big names in Christendom yet but coming up. He said, “We want to say that those clergymen were not fake, not mechanics or yam sellers as the purveyors of hatred have made Nigerians to believe in the social media. They are not big names in Christendom yet, they are gradually building up their missions. “They are church leaders who genuinely believe that Nigerians must eschew politics of hatred and religious bigotry and rather embrace politics of peace and nation building. “We, therefore, deplore the hysterical twisting of the presence of these men and women in cassocks and the false accusation against our candidates, Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu and Senator Shettima”.
