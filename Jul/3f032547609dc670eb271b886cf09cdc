Former Deputy President of the Senate, Senator Ike Ekweremadu, on Thursday appeared in court in London for a second time charged with arranging to bring a child to the UK for organ donation. Ekweremadu, 60, stood in the dock at Uxbridge Magistrates’ Court wearing a grey tracksuit and holding a bible. He will next appear at Westminster Magistrates’ court on July 7. No bail application was made and Ekweremadu will remain in custody. Part of the alleged offence was committed abroad and as a result the consent of the attorney general is required for the case to continue. He faces a charge of conspiracy to arrange or facilitate the travel of another person for exploitation under the Modern Slavery Act 2015. Ekweremadu’s wife Beatrice, 55, is charged with arranging or facilitating the travel of another person for exploitation and also appeared in court after a delay in her transport from prison. Last week, the London Metropolitan Police arrested and charged Ekweremadu and his wife for allegedly bringing a child to the UK for organ harvesting. The UK police had said the alleged donor, later identified as Ukpo Nwamini David, was 15 years old, but his passport data page showed he was born on October 12, 2000. Earlier this week, the Nigerian Immigration Authority denied the victim was a child. -Advertisement- POLL The comptroller general, Idriss Jerre, said the victim’s birth certificate and National Identity Number, which were presented during registration for his passport, showed that he was 21 years old. In response the Metropolitan Police said the child was 15.
