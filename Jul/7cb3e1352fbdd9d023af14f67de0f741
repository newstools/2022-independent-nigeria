Jose Mourinho is not finished building his grand project with Roma yet and he’s now pushing the club to sign Paris Saint-Germain midfielder Georginio Wijnaldum. The French giants have transfer listed the Dutch midfielder as they look to trim the squad a little following the change in management, with sporting director Luis Campos and coach Christophe Galtier keen to build a project in Paris. As highlighted by Calciomercato.com, intermediaries offered Wijnaldum to Roma and Milan earlier this month, and the former are significantly more interested than the latter. Mourinho is a fan of the former Liverpool man and believes he’d be a great fit for his tactical system in Rome. The Giallorossi could sign Wijnaldum on a loan deal with a €20m buy option attached, something which would still give PSG a capital gain. The main issue, however, is the Dutchman’s salary. Wijnaldum currently earns around €9m net per season in Paris and PSG would be open to paying half of that, leaving Roma to shore up the other €4.5m net for the season. The Growth Decree law cannot be taken advantage of as it would only a one-year loan, at least initially. Mourinho doesn’t want to miss out on Wijnaldum and so is pushing the Giallrossi management to make a move. Tiago Pinto is keen to make this happen and is also trying to lighten up the wage bill by rehoming Jordan Veretout, Amadou Diawara and Justin Kluivert.
