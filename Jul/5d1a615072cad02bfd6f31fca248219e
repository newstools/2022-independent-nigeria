 BENIN – The acting vice chancel­lor of the Edo State-owned Ambrose Alli University (AAU), Ekpoma, Professor Sonnie Adagbonyin, and the management of the uni­versity have been dragged to the National Universi­ties Commission (NUC) by some aggrieved students of the institution over al­leged plan by the universi­ty to commence the second semester examination for 2020/2021 academic session without being taught and prepared for the exams. The aggrieved students in a tense petition to the ex­ecutive secretary of NUC through a Lagos-based law­yer, Mr. Oriname Akeredo­lu, and dated June 29, 2022, informed the NUC that the university’s VC and the man­agement had concluded plans to commence the second semester examination for 2020/2021 academic session without the students being taught and prepared for the examination. The petition entitled ‘Pe­tition against the vice chan­cellor and management of Ambrose Alli University, Ek­poma, Edo State’, expressed serious concern that while the rollover national indus­trial action by various staff unions in public universities was still on “the university in a militia and Gestapo man­ner” announced the resump­tion of academic activities and a new adjusted academic calendar. The students are asking NUC to urgently intervene, failing which they would not hesitate to seek legal redress to stop the bastardization of their education.
