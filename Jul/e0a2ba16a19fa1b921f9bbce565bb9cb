AKURE – Immediate past Chairman of the Ondo State Oil Producing Development Commission(OSOPADEC) and a chieftain of All Progressives Congress(APC), Honourable Gbenga Edema, has urged Nigerians to seize the opportunity presented by the Eid-el-Kabir season to collectively pray for the nation out of its socio-economic and political challenges. This was contained in his congratulatory message to the Muslim faithful in Ondo State and in the country at large. The former member of the state House of Assembly implored Muslims to continue to emulate the love, kindness, and sacrifice displayed by the Holy Prophet Muhammad, (SAW), praying for peace and economic recovery in the country. Edema said: “We can collectively address our issues as a nation and create a genuinely peaceful and successful Nigeria by recognizing the supremacy of God, exhibiting genuine love and respect for one another, and committing to peaceful coexistence. “The country can only advance toward the realization of its immense potential as a nation through love for one another and dedication to peace, security, and stability. “Yes, the times are difficult, but we are a resilient people. Therefore, if we collectively commit to the principles of nation-building, I have no doubt that we will overcome our current security and economic setback sooner than expected. “I also call on each of us to do our part to build the connection of unity and oneness that unites us. This, I believe, will encourage us to stay away from negative tendencies that can thwart our attempts to ensure a more rapid economic recovery and  safer country.”
