Just as Simi said in her song ‘Man no like woman, woman no like woman’, the reality is that sometimes it feels like the world is against women. For all intents and purposes, it seems the six-year marriage between Funke Akindele and Abdulrasheed Bello, known professionally as JJC Skillz is done and dusted. While JJC Skillz was the one who made the announcement, fans have been coming for Funke Akindele nonstop and we know why. Analysts and industry watchers have said it is because she is the woman. In most failed marriage situations, it is the woman who gets the blame, even if the facts show equal liability between parties. It would be remembered that Benito, Funke Akindele’s controversial stepson, had alleged that during their six-year marriage, Funke Akindele and his father, JJC Skillz, were both adulterous. When asked if Funke Akindele and JJC Skillz were still together, he responded “Funke Akindele and my dad both cheated on each other. They are not really together.” Since JJC Skills took to his Instagram page to confirm that he and Funke had separated and that things were now beyond repair, social media has been buzzing with the news with many blaming Funke for her inability to keep any marriage. The separation is coming after the celebrity couple had disputed a rumoured breakup on Father’s Day, June 19. The duo had debunked the rumours by sending messages to each other via Instagram posts, putting up a united front of sorts.
