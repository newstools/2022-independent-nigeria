DAMATURU – Determined to ensure disease free society, the Yobe government said that it’s targeting 70,000 persons in 2022 under its Expanded Free Healthcare Service Scheme. Commissioner for Health and Human Services, Dr Mohammed Lawan Gana revealed this to newsmen in Damaturu during orientation programme for health care providers held at Cedars Event Center. According to him, the scheme aims at harmonizing free healthcare programmes including Basic Health Care Provision Fund (BHCPF), Free Drugs Programme and Equity Sector. Gana explained that about 50,000 poor and vulnerable persons were so far benefiting from all the programmes at primary, secondary and tertiary health care centres in the state. He noted that harmonizing the programmes would boost efficiency and cut waste of resources. “The expanded scheme is essentially about bringing all our free health care services under one umbrella. “We are doing this to ensure we avoid duplication, wastage of resources, and also ensuring that the right population are benefitting from the right programmes,” the commissioner said. Gana added that the state also pays 3.25 percent of the medical bills of every civil servant under its Formal Sector Contributory Programme which began in 2020. POLL On monitoring and evaluation, he said the state was doing its best to enhance the programmes and minimise challenges. “Complaint about not receiving these items sometimes is not because the items are not provided, but because of their reduction in quantity supplied. “And this is as a result of inflation and the rising cost of the dollar, which, of course, affects the drugs market. “For instance, Intravenous fluid that we used to procure at between 50 and N60 in 2014, now costs over N300. “However, we are doing our best to improve the system; that is why monitoring and evaluation is an integral component of the scheme,” he said.
