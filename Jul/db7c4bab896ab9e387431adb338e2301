ABUJA – The Inter Party Advisory Council (IPAC) has called on Nigerians to use the occasion of the Eid-el-Kabir celebration to pray for the unity, progress, development and advancement of the country. In a statement to mark the celebration, IPAC National Chairman, Yabagi Yusuf Sani, noted that through prayers and collective efforts of patriotic Nigerians the country will surmount and overcome the current challenges and build a great nation future generations will be proud of. In the statement, Yabagi regretted that “Nigeria is in a difficult situation entangled in economic stagnation that has impoverished millions of citizens, elongated security challenges, deplorable infrastructure and confusion in governance.” Accordingly, the statement encouraged Nigerians to participate in the ongoing voter registration, adding that it will give them the opportunity to elect credible leaders who will run the affairs of the nation in the next four years. This is as he expressed optimism that “with improved technology and the commitment of all stakeholders in the democratic process every vote will be counted and counted in all elections.” IPAC assured that it will not relent in advocating for free, fair, credible, transparent, acceptable, peaceful and inclusive elections, adding that it will resist retrogressive forces that impede the nation’s emerging democracy through rigging, violence and vote buying.
