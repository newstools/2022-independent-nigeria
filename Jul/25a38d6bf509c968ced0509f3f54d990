Political activist and co-convener of #Bringbackourgirls, Aisha Yesufu on Saturday charged Nigerian youths to organize genuine conversations with the presidential candidate of the Labour Party (LP), Peter Obi, on his presidential bid. Daily Independent understands that a lot of Nigerians, especially the youth, appeared to have shown keen interest in the candidacy and ability of Peter Obi to pull the country back from the brink. Obi, who has always condemned the extravagant tendencies of both the past and current administrations lamented the existential problems in the country, saying Nigeria must be transformed from consumption to a production country. Against the backdrop, Aisha who took her Twitter page in a series of tweets spoke in the context of wobbling consequential errors evident in the President Muhammadu Buhari-led administration, asking the youth to stop making mere assumptions about the LP candidate. According to her, town-hall meetings with the former Anambra State Governor would further avail Nigerians the opportunity to interrogate his candidacy and plans for the country. The tweet reads: “Time for the Nigerian youth and women to meet with Peter Obi and lock things down. What will his government look like if he wins? What percentage will be for the youth? What percentage will be for the women? With competence top! “Is Peter Obi going to have an inclusive government? Where every competent person whether youth, man or woman has a chance? Or is it a government of we joined politics together in 1999? “Don’t make assumptions. Have town hall meetings with Peter Obi and lock them down.”
