ABUJA  – Hon Chidi Duru, a chieftain of the All Progressives Congress (APC) and Deputy National Organising Secretary of the party, has debunked insinuating reports that the party’s National Chairman, Senator Abdullahi Adamu promised to return APC Senators that lost their primary elections back on the ballot in 2023, stating categorically that the APC National Chairman could not have made such unrealistic promise. Recall that following his august visit to the National Assembly amid threats of some of APC Senators to defect to the opposition parties, Adamu was reported to have assured the lawmakers that the party would return them to the ballot. However, Hon Duru said the APC National Chairman could not have made such promise in view of the provisions of the Electoral Act 2022. He observed that the Electoral Act had to a large extent whittled the powers of political parties and even removed their ability to substitute a candidate at will, as was the situation in the past. “The only condition in which the party can substitute any candidate is either the candidate resigns and says he is not running or the candidate dies. “The power to substitute at will is no longer there. So, it was not possible for the chairman to have made that promise at the Senate, to go to the Senate to consider a barter arrangement to necessitate a quid-pro-quo. “I’m in the party and I can tell you, our candidates emerged through the primary and in accordance with the guidelines and INEC observed the primaries.” According to him,what the chairman did was to reach out to the lawmakers to encourage them to keep faith with the party and to look out for opportunities that are available to them although they may not returning to the parliament in the ticket of the party.
