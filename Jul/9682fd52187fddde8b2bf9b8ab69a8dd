The main opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has conducted a sensitisation campaign for the Registration and collection of Permanent Voter Card (PVC) by residents of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT). The campaign, the party said was designed to sensitize residents on the importance of exercising their civic responsibility as well as casting their votes for the PDP to Rescue and Rebuild the country. The sensitization which started from the legacy House in Maitama the presidential campaign office of the PDP was led by the National publicity secretary, Hon Debo Ologunagba, and National Woman leader, Prof. Stella Effa-Attoe. Addressing the crowd of campaigners, Ologunagba said the PDP wants to sensitize Nigerians, “particularly youth and women on the need for them to participate actively in the democratic process by collecting their permanent voter cards and ensuring that they participate in the 2023 general elections.” He said the campaign has become more important because of the insensitive nature of the All Progressives Congress (APC) administration which has failed the People. He said, “We are urging all youth and women to come out en masse to pick up their PVCs and those who have not registered to take advantage of the window now available by INEC to come out and register and to pick up their permanent voter cards. “I want to assure you that the vote in 2023 will count because we have seen the evil that APC is and we are determined to move ahead with PDP in the mission to rescue and rebuild Nigeria enough is enough of APC and the madness called the government of APC.”
