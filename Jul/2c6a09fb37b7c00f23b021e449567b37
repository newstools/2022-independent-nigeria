LAGOS  – The Ogun State Traffic Compliance and Enforcement Agency, TRACE, has given owners of vehicles parked haphazardly on Ogun roads a week notice from Monday 18 – Sunday 25, July, to remove them. Seni Ogunyemi, TRACE Corps Commander /CEO gave the directive on Friday in Abeokuta, the state capital during an interview with journalists. He said the directive was necessitated by the increasing number of accidents in the state, most of which were caused by haphazard and illegal parking on the roads, he said: “From our records, it is glaring that most of the accidents that occurred in the state were caused by haphazard parking. We can no longer condone the careless attitude of such vehicle owners. “It is either an oncoming vehicle driven by a careless driver is rammed into a stationary vehicle haphazardly parked on the road, leading to terrible accidents or such vehicle blocks other road users leading to traffic bottlenecks prompting loss of life and property. Enough is enough”. To drastically eliminate or reduce crashes from such negligence, Cdr. Ogunyemi revealed he had directed all Area Commanders in TRACE to remove vehicles found contravening this order after the expiration of the weeks’ notice. He assured that the directive is within the ambit of its powers as a traffic regulatory agency. Cdr. Ogunyemi, however, stressed that the Agency has to take this drastic action to save the lives of road users, especially in the present raining season.
