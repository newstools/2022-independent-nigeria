French carmaker Renault RENA. PA, said car sales plunged 30 per cent in the first half of 2022 after shutting down activities in Russia, one of the first Western auto manufacturers to lay bare the damage of losing a key market in the wake of the Ukraine war. Renault, the Western carmaker most exposed to the Russian market, said its worldwide sales fell 29.7 per cent from last year to just over one million vehicles. Excluding the activities of Avtovaz and Renault Russia, the number of units sold was down 12 per cent year-on-year. Renault shares fell 2.3 per cent in early trading. Russia was Renault’s second biggest market before the war, accounting for 15 per cent of earnings, according to JPMorgan. The group, which makes popular models such as the Dacia Duster and Renault Clio, shut down its activities in the country earlier this year and said it would sell Renault Russia and a 67.7 per cent stake in Avtovaz. In May, Renault said it would sell Avtovaz, Russia’s biggest carmaker and owner of the Lada brand, to a Russian science institute, reportedly for just one rouble with a six-year option to buy it back.
