ABUJA – The All Progressives Congress (APC) has felicitated with Muslims on the occasion of the Eid-El-Kabir festival urging them not to succumb to activities of retrogressive element bent dividing the country. The party in a statement said the festival itself is a call to sacrifice and submission to the will of Allah and enjoined the Muslim Ummah, to use the period to recommit themselves to Islamic teachings of understanding, tolerance and peaceful coexistence. “As we celebrate with family, friends and other loved ones, we will do well to be our brothers’ keeper by extending kindness to our neigbours, particularly the needy and less-priviledged. “On this occasion of Eid-El-Kabir, we urge all Nigerians to place national interest first in all dealings. We must not yield to retrogressive elements who seek to divide us through terror and hate. “We further urge Nigerians to continue to support and pray for the government of President Muhammadu Buhari as it tackles our national security challenges just as we continue to reject insensitive and unpatriotic attempts by some partisans to politicise security breaches by enemies of our land. “On this occasion of Eid-El-Kabir, we urge all Muslims to pray for sustained peace, security and prosperity of the country as the APC-led government continues to prioritize the wellbeing and safety of all Nigerians. Barka da Sallah!”
