Russian President Vladimir Putin is to travel to Iran on July 19 to hold talks with Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, the Kremlin announced on Tuesday. The three heads of state are to discuss the situation in the civil war in Syria, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said, according to the Interfax news agency. Putin is also to hold bilateral talks with Erdoğan. The United States previously said that it had evidence that Iran intended to provide assistance to Russia in its invasion of Ukraine in the form of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), or drones. “Our information indicates that the Iranian government is preparing to provide Russia with up to several hundred UAVs, including weapons-capable UAVs on an expedited timeline,” US National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan told journalists in Washington on Monday. He added that Iran is to also train Russians to use the UAVs and such training could begin as early as mid-July. It is unclear, however, whether the weapons have already been delivered. Sullivan understands the information as an indication that Russia’s progress in the war in eastern Ukraine has had consequences for themaintenance of its own stockpiles of weapons. Iran rejected Sullivan’s statements. “There has been no such thing in recent times and our position in the Ukraine conflict is well-known,” Foreign Ministry spokesman Nasser Kanaani said on Tuesday. POLL Tehran understands Russia’s reaction to NATO’s eastward expansion but is in favour of a diplomatic and against a military solution to the crisis, he said. Kanaani explained that there is technological cooperation between Russia and Iran, but it started long before the war in Ukraine, the spokesman said, according to the ISNA news agency.
