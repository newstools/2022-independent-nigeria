Less than 72 hours to the Osun State gubernatorial election, the Organized Labour movement in the state has endorsed Governor Gboyega Oyetola for a second term in office. The labour movement which includes the Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC), Trade Union Congress (TUC) and Joint Negotiating Council (JNC) mobilized their members in their thousands for the historical event. Speaking with newsmen, the State Chairman of the TUC, Mr Adekola Adebowale said the step became necessary to appreciate the good gesture of governor Gboyega Oyetola to the welfare of workers. Adebowale noted that the governor had shown genuine concern for the issues of workers by sustaining regular payment of salaries and pensions in the state. In a remark, the Chairman of the Joint Negotiating Council, Bayo Adejumo said this was the first time the state that a worker-friendly governor and not that the union needed to reciprocate the gesture by voting governor Oyetola in the July 16th governorship election in the state. Mr Adejumo maintained that workers in the state would support the government that was keen on human and infrastructure development. Also speaking, the state head of service, Festus Olowogboyega lauded governor Oyetola for the outstanding qualities that stand him out as a true leader who understands the yearning and aspirations of his people. Olowogboyega noted that in the last three and half years the governor had run a people-oriented government and this has actually positioned him for a second term in office. POLL Responding, Osun state governor, Mr Gboyega Oyetola thanked workers for their support and promised to sustain the tempo if given the opportunity to serve for the second term. Governor Oyetola said his administration would continue to place priority on welfare and lauded them for their show of support and understanding. It would be recalled that this is the first time the labour movement will be publicly endorsed a candidate since the creation of the state.
