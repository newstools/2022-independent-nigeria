In what was a bizarre match up between the Europa Conference League winners and a side from the English second tier, Mourinho’s Roma side unsurprisingly outclassed their opponents as they came away 2-0 winners. But the moment of the match belonged to the Roma boss after he stormed onto the pitch to demand a red card be shown to Black Cats player Luke O’Nien. Around the 40th minute mark, with the game locked at 0-0, O’Nien put in a heavy challenge on Roma player Roger Ibanez, this angered Mourinho and his staff as they entered the pitch whilst Ibanez was being attended to by the medical team. According to The Mirror, the reason why Mourinho entered the pitch was to demand O’Nien be sent off. However, O’Nien was only showed a yellow card but was eventually substituted to prevent him getting a second booking. Sunderland showed great stubbornness and determination as they managed to hold Roma out until the 75th minute. Felix Afena Gyan scored the opening goal before midfielder Nicolo Zaniolo added a second in the 85th minute. The match against Roma was a stern test for Sunderland who are preparing for their first season back in the Championship since the 17/18 campaign. Led by manager Alex Neil, the Black Cats will hope to secure safety as the bare minimum. For Roma, they will be looking to build on a successful 21/22 season, after winning their first European trophy for 61 years. Mourinho has strengthened his side after bringing in former Manchester United midfielder Nemanja Matic and defender Mehmet Celik from French Ligue 1 side Lille. POLL The Italian club will be playing in the Europa League in the new season after their sixth place finish in the Serie A last season, Mourinho last won the Europa League when he was in charge of the Old Trafford club. With Mourinho already fired up for pre season, it could be good news for Roma fans as they are expecting bigger and better things from their team.
