A human rights activist and a former aide to ex-President Goodluck Jonathan, Reno Omokri has revealed why the Governor of Rivers State, Nyesom Wike is too big to be a running mate to the presidential candidate of the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) in the 2023 general elections, Atiku Abubakar. Omokri who spoke on Arise Television’s Morning Show on Monday said that rather than being a running mate to Atiku, Wike should be the next President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria after the tenure of the former Vice President Atiku, if he wins the 2023 presidential election. Speaking on Wike leaving the main opposition party, he said the Governor had made it known in public and private that nothing can make him leave the opposition party. Speaking further on the programme, Omokri, however, insisted there was no crisis in the PDP and Governor Wike has no plan to dump the main opposition party. He said, “Governor Wike has told us in private and in also public that he’s never going to leave the party.” “Alhaji Atiku Abubakar has called Governor Nyesom Wike our Jagaban and it’s true because the man has almost a larger-than-life image “Governor Wike is even too big to become Vice president. I see him as somebody who would be President after Atiku Abubakar. “This is a man who has Charisma, who has the courage and would unify Nigeria. And as such a person, he understands the larger issues.”
