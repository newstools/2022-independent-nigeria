The Governor of Yobe State, Mai Mala Buni has contacted the Federal Government through the National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) to support over a dozen communities devastated by a flood in Gulani, Gujba and some other local government areas in the state. Meanwhile, the Governor has directed the State Ministry of Humanitarian Affairs, and State Emergency Management Agency (SEMA) to provide emergency relief materials to the affected communities. Governor Buni said the need for collaborative efforts with the federal government and NEMA became imperative in view of the huge devastation suffered by the communities. SEMA visited the affected communities for a detailed assessment of the damage and the scope of support required, as well as to provide emergency relief materials to the victims. The flood came following hours of heavy downpour sweeping off many downstream communities. Farmlands and livestock were also lost to the floods. Similarly, about half a kilometre of the road linking Gulani and Gujba Local Government Areas has been washed away, cutting off Gulani LGA from other parts of the state. Buni expressed deep sympathy to the victims who lost their houses, farms and livestock, assuring them of government assistance.
