The apex body of Yoruba Self-Determination and Self-Preservation Struggle, Ilana Omo Oodua Worldwide (IOO), has said that the suit it instituted to challenge the making and validity of the 1999 constitution of Nigeria as amended shall be withdrawn and be re-filed at the Abuja Division of Federal High Court within the next two weeks. According to a statement signed by Mr Maxwell Adeleye, the Communications Manager to the Leader of IOOW, Professor Banji Akintoye, the decision to withdraw the suit to achieve a better result and in line with the new Practice Direction since the Attorney General of the Federation resides in Abuja-FCT. “The Lead Counsel representing us in the case, Mr Tolu Babaleye, has advised that the Plaintiffs should withdraw the suits in order to consolidate the matter and refile it at the Abuja division of the Federal High Court because the major prayer which is the invalidation of the 1999 constitution of Nigeria can only be heard at the Abuja Division in line with the Ruling of Ado-Ekiti division of the Court on appropriate forum. “Aftermath the Ruling on the Matter in Ado-Ekiti Federal High Court, Our Counsel and other Senior Advocates advised that as ruled by the Judge in Ekiti, what the Plaintiffs in Ekiti and Osun States are praying for are matters that affect the whole Nigerian Federation. “The Plaintiffs want the 1999 constitution invalidated because its making is against the spirit of natural justice and fairness and the Judge in Federal High Court in Ekiti State ruled that the appropriate place to institute the matter is the Abuja Division, and not in Ekiti. “Though we have our reservations we do not want to waste our time on technicalities. We are withdrawing the suit in Osogbo, the Plaintiffs in Osogbo will join the Plaintiffs in Ado-Ekiti, with fresh Plaintiffs who are indigenes of Lagos, Ogun, Oyo and the Ondo States to institute the case afresh in the Abuja Division of Federal High Court. “Our Legal Team are of the opinion that this is the best way to go and they are confident that the outcome of the suit will make the Yoruba People and all lovers of Justice, Fairness and Self-Determination worldwide rejoice. As far as we are concerned, it is a no retreat, no surrender”, the statement said.
