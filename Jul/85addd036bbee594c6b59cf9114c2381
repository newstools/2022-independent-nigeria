LAGOS- Amstel Malta Ultra, the official Malt drink of the Super Falcons, is very positive the Nigeria women’s team will return to winning ways on Thursday at the ongoing Women’s Africa Cup of Nations (WAFCON) in Morocco. After Monday’s faulty start against the Banyana Banyana of South Africa, the Super Falcons need an outright win against Botswana to get their campaign back on track. Unlike the Super Falcons who lost 2-1 in their opening game, debutants Botswana recorded a 4-2 win over Burundi to go top in Group C. However, Amstel Malta Ultra believes the Super Falcons have learnt from the mistakes made against South Africa and would be putting up an improved display against Gaoletlhoo Nkutlwisang’s side. While reiterating Amstel Malta’s unflinching support for the Super Falcons, the Senior Brand Manager, Maire Abia-Bassey, noted that one of the hallmarks of true champions is the ability to come out stronger from initial setbacks. The Amstel Malta Brand Manager said she believes the Super Falcons will get it right against Botswana and would make Nigerians proud again. “No one expected the Super Falcons to have it all easy in Morocco but we remain confident in their ability to surmount every obstacle and make it all the way to achieve their dream for a 10th title,” she stated. Coincidentally, the Super Falcons also lost their opening game at the last edition of WAFCON four years ago in Ghana before going all the way to win the title for a record-extending ninth time. -Advertisement- POLL Already, the Super Falcons coach, Randy Waldrum has hinted at the likelihood of adopting new tactics for the Botswana game as he insists nothing short of the maximum three points will be good enough for his team. Amstel Malta is one of the longest corporate sponsorships on the stable of the Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) and since coming on board, the Super Falcons’ supporter ship has indeed soared and is comparable to the global standard of the game.
