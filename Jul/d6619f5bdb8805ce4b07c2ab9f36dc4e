Mikel Arteta has insisted Kieran Tierney is in ‘good condition’ after the defender was withdrawn in the first half of Friday’s friendly in Germany. The left-back missed the end of last season with a knee injury, and lasted only 30 minutes of our win over Nurnberg. With the Gunners already 2-0 down at the time, it looked like being one problem after another at that stage, but after the game Arteta revealed it was part of the plan to ease the Scotland international back into action. “He’s really good,” the manager said. “He’s been training really good. Obviously he’s been out for over three months now so we wanted to give him a proper warm-up, play the first half an hour and then get him out. “So he was in good condition and there’s no issues there.”
