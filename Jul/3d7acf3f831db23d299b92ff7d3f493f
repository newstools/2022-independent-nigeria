Governor Hope Uzodimma has dissolved the 27-man Interim Management Committee Chairmen of Imo State. He did on Thursday after a closed door meeting with them at the Sam Mbakwe Executive Chambers, Government House Owerri. At the meeting, Governor Uzodimma thanked them for the services they rendered in their different local government areas since their appointment about two and half years ago and for their loyalty. He also reminded them of his resolve to hold the Local Government Area election in Imo State any moment from now and the need for him to appoint Sole Administrators who will oversee the coming election. Governor Uzodimma also told the dissolved IMC Chairmen that his government will not hesitate to engage their services in other areas they are found capable as APC members. In their response by Chairman of ALGON in Imo State, Mr Willie Okoliogo, who is also the Chairman of Oru West Council, the IMC Chairmen promised to remain loyal to the governor and the APC.
