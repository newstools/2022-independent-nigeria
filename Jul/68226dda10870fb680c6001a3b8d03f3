The Director General of Jandor 2023 Campaign Organization, Dr Seye O’Dairo has congratulated the People’s Democratic Party Governorship candidate in Osun State  and the Governor-elect, Senator Ademola Adeleke for his brilliant performance and overwhelming victory in the just concluded Osun State Governorship election in State. The organisation  in a press statement on Sunday appreciated the people of Osun for supporting PDP and rejecting the All Progressives  Congress (APC) at the polls even with series of intimidations and alleged attempt to buy people’s conscience, stressing that they stood their grounds and said it was time for Imole (light) to shine on Osun. “This election has proven beyond reasonable doubt that Senator Ademola Adeleke’s mandate was stolen in 2018 and the good people of Osun stood their ground to prevent another upset by the ruling party who will now be in the opposition in the state as soon as the governor-elect is sworn in. The Director-General also encouraged Lagosians to vote for the Lagos PDP gubernatorial candidate Dr Abdul-Azeez Olajide Adediran  popularly called Jandor in 2023 general elections. He said “we assure you that succour is coming to Lagos come 2023 when PDP under the leadership of Jandor/ Funke will take over the state and a breath of fresh air will serenade across the state. “Just like the Israelites, the Egyptians you see today, you shall see them no more,” he said. He also admonished them that this can only be possible if they register to vote and also cast their votes massively for the PDP at the Presidential and also the Governorship election in Lagos come 2023.
