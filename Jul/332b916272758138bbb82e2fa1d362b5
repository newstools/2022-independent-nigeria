Raheem Sterling will undergo a medical on Sunday night as he closes in on a move to Chelsea. The England winger is leaving Manchester City to join Chelsea and the deal is worth up to £50million, including add-ons. Sterling will sign a five-year contract with Chelsea, which will include the option for a further 12 months, and he will become the Blues’ highest-paid player. The 27-year-old will undergo a medical in London on Sunday night ahead of joining the Chelsea squad next week for their tour in America. Sterling is making the move to Chelsea as he wants to play week in, week out and compete for major honours. The 27-year-old wants to win the Champions League, while he is also determined to compete for the Ballon d’Or too. Sterling’s move to Chelsea is not motivated by money but his desire to play every week and battle for major honours. The winger was not a guaranteed starter for Manchester City last season and, with just one year left on his contract there, he believes it is time for a new challenge. City have accepted Sterling’s request and talks over his future have been amicable, with the 27-year-old given time to mull over his options. POLL Barcelona, Bayern Munich, Liverpool, Paris Saint-Germain and Real Madrid all showed some interest, but Chelsea won the race following a personal pitch from head coach Thomas Tuchel. Sterling is understood to view the German as one of the best coaches in world football and he respected his honest approach during talks. Tuchel laid out to Sterling how he will have a key role at Chelsea and the winger is excited by the prospect of being a key player for the Blues.
