Julian Alvarez was not keen to play up his future partnership with Erling Haaland, instead insisting he will focus on his own game at Manchester City. Alvarez signed for City in January, but has only arrived at the club this week and will begin training with his new teammates on Monday including £51million signing Haaland. The two strikers will give City’s squad a completely new dynamic, but Alvarez was not interested in discussing a potential strike partnership before taking to the training pitch. With Haaland expected to take a prominent role in Pep Guardiola’s plans, Alvarez may have to play a waiting game for opportunities through the middle, but he vowed to play wherever he was asked – even if he preferred playing as the main striker. When asked about playing with Haaland, he said: “Haaland is a great player, he’s shown it before, he always scored goals. I don’t have to focus on him, I want to focus on myself, work hard in training and when I have the chance to play, give my best and contribute to the team. “I’ll try to give my best to adapt to the team and competition as much as possible to help and contribute and play. I can play in different positions, in the centre or the wings. I feel comfortable close to the box because it helps me scoring goals, but I’m versatile, I can adapt and create assists so I would highlight the versatility. “I haven’t spoken about my position with anybody. Tomorrow when we join the team we’ll find out what we can do.” Alvarez also dismissed the idea that he will need a rest, having played 24 times for River Plate since February and with no summer break like his new teammates. “It’s true, I’ve played a lot of games,” he said. “But I’ve been in this situation before and I didn’t need a rest and could perform. I’m really excited to play for this team and I want to give 100 per cent.”
