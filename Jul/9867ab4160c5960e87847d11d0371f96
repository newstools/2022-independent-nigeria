Akure – The Commissioner for Water and Sanitation in Ondo State, Mrs. Yetunde Adeyanju, has resigned her appointment a couple of hours after her redeployment to the state Ministry of Physical Planning and Urban Development on Wednesday. Governor Oluwarotimi Akeredolu, while inaugurating two new commissioners appointed to replace two commissioners who resigned from the cabinet to pursue their political ambitions, announced reshuffle of his cabinet. Adeyanju, who was affected by the reshuffle, tendered her resignation shortly after the governor announced the reshuffle on grounds that she wanted to explore other terrains outside politics. In her letter to the governor heralding her pulling out of the administration, Mrs. Adeyanju appreciated the governor for offering her the opportunity to serve the people of Ondo State. The letter read in parts: “I hereby resign my appointment as a commissioner in Ondo State with immediate effect. “My decision is predicated on a personal conviction to explore other endeavours outside politics for now. “However, I’m grateful to you for the golden opportunity given to me to contribute to the growth of our dear state, especially with the Kamomi Aketi Rural Water Supply. “You gave me the platform and I’m proud that I used it well for the good of humanity. Kamomi Aketi water scheme remains the joy of thousands of rural dwellers today. “Once again, I thank you for the opportunity to serve.”
