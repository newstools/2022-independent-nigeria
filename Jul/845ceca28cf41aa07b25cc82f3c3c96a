Ejovwokeoghene Avbenagha, also known as Ejay Stephanie, is a newcomer to the music scene. She said the reason she started writing music was to share her experiences with failure and success in hopes of inspiring others and reviving those who listen to it. Despite being relatively new to the business, Ejay has been able to secure some amazing collaborations with top-tier musicians from Nigeria’s music industry, including Davido, the top star of the 30 B.G. According to her: “My intention in the Nigerian music industry is to take Afrobeats to another new level. “Given that I make music involving other genres, I desire to infuse these musical flavours into my creations. “I like to experiment a lot, so we’ll see what happens, especially with my E.P that’s dropping soon enough”. The actor, musician and legal practitioner burst into the music scene with her first single, titled “Strong”, a personally inspired project driven by personal experiences she mentioned she encountered early on in life, right before venturing into music. Her music features a fine mix of Afrobeats, hip-hop, R & B and Kwaito sounds. -Advertisement- POLL Before starting out in music, Ejay completed her Bachelor of Law degree in 2015 at Benue State University. She then moved on to attend the Nigerian Law School in 2015 after which she works as a legal practitioner to date.
