As the battle for the 2023 presidential election draws closer, a chieftain of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), Joe Igbokwe has called on the South-East leaders to choose between actualizing the Biafra Republic or aspiring to get the position of a Secretary to the Government of the Federation (SGF) or the Senate President. Igbokwe, who spoke via his verified Facebook page advised the Igbo leaders to decide what they want ahead of the 2023 general elections as they do not have a strong presidential candidate that can defeat the APC presidential candidate, Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu. Speaking further, the Special Adviser to the Governor of Lagos State on Drainage and Water Resources,  said Igbo leaders should be definite about the positions they want and present their position to Tinubu when he becomes president in 2023. He wrote, “Leaders of Igbo Nation must collectively and clearly bring their thoughts together to say what we want. We want SSG and SP. We want Biafra too. What do we want as critical stakeholders in Nigeria?” It could be recalled that prior to the presidential primary elections of the Peoples Democratic Party  (PDP) and ruling APC, Igbo leaders had clamoured for the Southeast presidency. But, unfortunately, both presidential candidates of the two major political parties in Nigeria emerged from other regions. Meanwhile, some Southeast members of the APC had demanded the positions of the SGF and Senate President if the party’s presidential candidate, Bola Tinubu wins in 2023.
