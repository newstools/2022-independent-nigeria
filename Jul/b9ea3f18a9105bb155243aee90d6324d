LAGOS – The President General of Ohanaeze Ndigbo, Ambassador (Prof) George Obiozor has said that it is clear that the major political parties, Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and the All Progressives Congress (APC) have perfected plans to deny the South-East region of the opportunity to produce the next president in 2023. According to Obiozor in a press statement on Saturday made available to journalists by Dr Chiedozie Alex Ogbonnia, the National Publicity Secretary of the socio-political organisation, where the President General asked a rhetorical question, What does Nigeria want from Ndigbo? He stated that it is clear that the Nigerian national political elite has successfully orchestrated plan to deny the South-East an opportunity to produce the president of Nigeria come 2023. “By this machination, some Nigerian leaders have demonstrated gross historic injustice towards Ndigbo, beyond our expectations,” Obiozor said. Obiozor who is convalescing in a Dubai hospital notes that the country, by deliberate injustice has failed the Rotary International Club four-way tests, the things we think, say or do, Is it the truth? “Secondly, is it fair to all concerned? Thirdly, will it build goodwill and better friendship? Finally, will it be beneficial to all concerned? He urged Ndigbo, not to lament much but wait for the verdict of history, stressing that in the end, the political manipulation will end in a pyrrhic victory for those who rejoice and celebrate injustice. -Advertisement- POLL “I want to also use this opportunity to appreciate all those Nigerian statesmen and patriots across the country, who supported the idea for the South-East to produce the president of Nigeria in 2023, based on Nigerian proven history of rotation of power between the north and the south as well as commitment to equity, justice and fairness,” he noted.
