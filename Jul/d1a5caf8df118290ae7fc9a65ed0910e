Ace Nigerian singer and music producer, David Adeleke, popularly known as Davido has revealed that his uncle, Ademola Adeleke, the Osun State governor-elect in the just concluded gubernatorial election is yet to receive his Certificate of Return from the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC). The 29-year-old ‘Omo Baba Olowo’ crooner who made the revelation in a post shared on his verified Twitter page on Tuesday wondered why the electoral body had not presented his uncle with the certificate of return, 48 hours after he was declared the winner of the governorship election. Daily Independent had on Sunday reported that the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) announced Adeleke, the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) as the winner of the election keenly contested by over five political parties in the state. According to the electoral umpire, Adeleke polled a total of 403,371 votes ahead of the incumbent Governor Gboyega Oyetola of the All Progressives Congress (APC), who polled 375,027 votes. Reacting to the silence from the INEC end two days after Adeleke’s victory, Davido, however, called on the Commission to as a matter of urgency issue the certificate as required by law while urging them not to allow anyone to tamper with the will of the people in the last Saturday’s poll. He tweeted, “48hrs after our @AAdeleke_01 victory at the Osun Gubernatorial elections, we are yet to receive our certificate. @inecnigeria should we send you fuel money? LOL,” Davido tweeted. “Please no one should tamper with the will of the Osun People! Issue the certificate as required by Law!”
