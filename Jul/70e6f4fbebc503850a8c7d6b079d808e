ABUJA – The leadership of the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) has disassociated itself from the act of the Pastor arrested in Ondo who reportedly camped his church members in the church premises, misleading them into believing that the Second Coming of Jesus Christ popularly referred to as rapture has come. They also called on the Police to investigate him and his activities with a view to prosecuting him and his cohorts if there had been any infringement on the law of Nigeria and the rights of the members in his custody. This was contained in a statement signed by Pastor Adebayo Oladeji, Special Assistant (Media & Communications) to the CAN President, His Eminence, Rev Dr. Samson Ayokunle, and made available to newsmen in Abuja. The statement reads, “According to reports, one Josiah Peter Asumosa, an assistant Pastor in a church located in Ondo West Local government area of Ondo State was lying to the uninformed members that Rapture would take place in April but later said it had been changed to September, 2022 and told the young members to obey only their parents in the Lord. “Though, the Pastor in question and his church, the Whole Bible Believers Church in Ondo are not members of the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) at all levels and so, he is not known to us, the fact that the church claims to be a Christian church necessitates that we state our position on his practice.
