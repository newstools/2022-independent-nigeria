Financial institutions in the country have been challenged to support the growth of the automobile industry in Nigeria. This is as the Lagos State Government reiterated that it would continue to create the enabling environment for the expansion of the private sector in the state. Mr. Babajide Sanwo-Olu, the Lagos State governor, stated this on Thursday in Lagos at the commissioning of the GAC Motor showroom, workshop and the GS 4 Sports Utility Vehicle (SUV). According to Sanwo-Olu, the automobile industry required the support of financial institutions to continue to expand their operations and create jobs for the public. He explained that without such support, growth in the sector would be limited, while the unemployment rate would continue to climb. Besides, he promised that the state government would continue to create a convenient environment for private investors through its programmes and policies. Also, the governor informed that the state government was partnering with GAC Motor for the establishment of an assembly plant in Ikeja and expressed optimism that it would be commissioned before the end of the year. He said: ”We are also partnering with GAC Motor on an assembly plant in the state. This is a partnership between the Lagos State Government and the company. -Advertisement- POLL ”This shows we are not just buying finished products, but we are also partnering with the company to boost employment opportunities. The brands of GAC are actually around employment generation. And for us, this is another very first.” In her remarks, Chief Diana Chen, the chairman, GAC Motor Nigeria, commended Sanwo-Olu for encouraging private investors to thrive in the state through its policies and programmes.
