YENAGOA – The Bayelsa State Governor, Douye Diri, threatened on Tuesday that the kidnappers of a former state Commissioner for Special Projects, Mr. Mike Ogiasa, would face the wrath of the law. Diri, who eventually reacted to the abduction of Ogiasa about 40 days after the incident happened, assured the people that the state government was working to ensure he regains his freedom. A statement issued on Tuesday by his Chief Press Secretary, Mr. Daniel Alabrah, said the governor spoke during the 17th State Security Council meeting held inside Government House, Yenagoa. Ogiasa, who is a cousin of former President Goodluck Jonathan, was kidnapped by an eight-member armed gang from his country home at Otuogidi in the Ogbia Local Government Area of the state on June 2, 2022. He was spotted in a viral video on Saturday wearing only shorts in a flooded shallow grave with his hands and legs tied, and his covered with black sack. In the 27 seconds video, the victim was seen appealing to family members and friends to pay the ransom demanded by his assailants in order for them to release him, lamenting that his life was more important than money. He said, “It’s my life. Is the money that is there more important than my life? You’re seeing me in the grave (pit), please do everything possible to come and release me. “Any money that is available; any money that you can make; do everything possible to come and release me. Is the money more important than my life? Is the money more important than my life?” Diri, who condemned the kidnap of the former commissioner, stressed that his administration had zero tolerance for crime and criminality, and all those involved in the kidnap will not go scotfree. POLL He cautioned youths against involvement in crime, stating that it is an ill-wind that blows no one no good.
