He contended that in 2023, all persons appointed or elected to key positions in all facets of governance must be on merit,their performance frequently evaluated and monitored to ensure prudence as well as sustainability. He said: “The COVID-19 pandemic, crashing insecurity challenges and the serious gaps in policy implementation are obvious shocks causing high cost of living in Nigeria, so going forward, we need leaders with immense capacity to stem the drift threatening to take us to total economic collapse which might lead to social unrest capable of destabilising the whole nation. “The food system should be reinvigorated to work seamlessly in order to attain the food sufficiency necessary for the achievement of optimum performance from all citizens towards nation building. “To be able to achieve maximum impact in our effort to make Nigeria to work optimally, all Nigerians must shun religious,regional and tribal sentiments first. “With our abundant land,human capital and the size of our economy we can easily become a first world country provided that we ensure capable leadership to manage our affairs. “It is not too late in the day to bring about these changes provided we reappraise our situation against the backdrop of all the existential challenges we have been facing lately.”
