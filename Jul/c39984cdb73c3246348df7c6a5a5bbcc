AWKA – Amidst agitations from those affected by the new tax regime of the Anambra State government Press Secretary to Governor Chukwuma Charles Soludo, Chris Aburime has added his voice to douse tension that trailed the new arrangements. According to him, the new tax regime has brought sanity and accountability to the tax payment system. Last week witnessed agitations from sections of transporters, notably tricycle and shuttle drivers. In the tax regime, tricycle operators would pay N15,000 on a monthly basis amounting to N600.00 daily; while shuttle operators are to pay N25,000 monthly. Similarly, the new rate for motorcycle (Okada) operators is N300 daily at N7, 500 monthly. There are discounts if the operators pay in bulk on a quarterly or monthly basis. However, the operators took to the streets in Awka protesting the arrangements. But the government noted that the operators before now pay even more than the new regime.
