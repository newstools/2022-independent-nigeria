Robert Lewandowski has confirmed that he has said farewell to his Bayern Munich teammates as he edges closer to a move to Barcelona. Lewandowski has made no secret of his desire to join La Blaugrana this summer, speaking publicly urging Bayern to let him depart on several occasions. The move had seemed in doubt for some time due to Barca’s financial problems but after the club operated the ‘second lever’ on their economic recovery recently, the transfer should be completed imminently. As reported by 90min, Barcelona want to complete the signing by the end of the weekend and have agreed a deal worth €50m with Bayern. And Lewandowski confirmed that he would be on the move after completing what is likely to be his final training session for Die Roten on Saturday. “I will come back and say goodbye to all the employees properly. I didn’t have much time to prepare for it now,” the striker told Sky Sports Germany. “These eight years were special and you don’t forget that. I had a great time in Munich. I will fly soon, but after the training camp I will come again and say goodbye properly and organize a few things. “I said goodbye to the guys on the pitch today I wasn’t worried about an injury in training. Something can happen to me at home. Wanted to keep fit and trained with the boys again.” POLL Lewandowski is set to become the club’s fourth signing of the transfer window after Franck Kessie, Andreas Christensen and Raphinha. Ousmane Dembele has also re-signed after his contract expired at the end of last season.
