Gleison Bremer said goodbye to Torino via his Instagram account ahead of his move to rivals Juventus. Despite long-standing interest from Inter, it appears the Brazilian will join the Bianconeri as a replacement for Matthijs de Ligt, who has signed for Bayern Munich. Bremer has been at Torino since 2018 but really came to the fore last term as he was named Serie A’s Best Defender. Bremer wrote on Instagram: “Dear Torino supporters, the moment to say goodbye has arrive. It has been four very intense years. “Initially there were difficult moments, tears and a lot of work to earn my place, working and battling. I arrived in Turin as a boy and this team helped me become what I am today. “I want to say thank you to everyone has been part of my growth not only as a player but above all as a man. You will all always been in my heart. “And one thing is for certain: wherever I go, I will always be a supporter.” Bremer started his professional career in his native Brazil with Atlético Mineiro and made just 32 appearances before joining Torino at the age of 21. POLL In all, he has made 110 appearance for Torino and scored 13 goals. At Juve, Bremer will have huge shoes to fill as, not long has De Ligt left for the Bundesliga, but the Bianconeri also said goodbye to captain Giorgio Chiellini at the end of last season. The former Italy captain joined Major League Soccer side Los Angeles FC.
