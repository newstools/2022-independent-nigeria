Ajax’s sporting director has issued a furious hands-off warning to Manchester United as they eye a move for Antony. Erik ten Hag is keeping tabs on the winger as the Dutchman looks to bolster his forward options. Lisandro Martínez is on the verge of officially completing his move from Ajax to United, following in Ten Hag’s footsteps, after Tyrell Malacia and Christian Eriksen completed their moves to Old Trafford. The Eredivisie champions are desperately attempting to fend off any interest in their remaining stars. Sebastien Haller, Martinez, Ryan Gravenberch and André Onana have already departed this summer, and club chief Gerry Hamstra has now lifted the lid on the club’s stance on Antony. “I know some of our players are still targeted and they are trying to pull them away. It is obvious, we have capital on the pitch,” Hamstra said (as per the Mirror ). “But we are keeping the squad we have left. Nobody is going anywhere now. We have made it clear to the players, we have had big talks with the players who have a strong desire to leave the club at this moment. “Let us make this clear, we did not even want to lose Martinez, but the figures for the transfer fee were going to such heights that anyone in football knows how it works then. We had to let him go. “But we still have massive ambitions at Ajax. We play in the Champions League and we can’t afford to let go of six key players.”
