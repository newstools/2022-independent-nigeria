Wildfires have devoured thousands of hectares of forests in northern Morocco as firefighters struggle to extinguish the flames. The National Agency for Water and Forests said on Monday that more than 6,600 hectares of forests have been damaged by the fires. It added, however, that firefighters have managed to put out more than 70% of the fires that ravaged remote mountain forests north of the kingdom. Local authorities said firefighters have been struggling for a sixth day in a row to contain fires that erupted in the areas of Larache, Ouezzane, Tetouan, and Taza in northern Morocco. “Around 20 towns have been evacuated in an attempt to maintain lives and property,” the agency said. Morocco has been hit in recent days by soaring temperatures approaching 45C (113F). According to local authorities, one person was killed by the fires, which forced the evacuation of more than 1,000 families. Official figures show that the North African country has seen 165 fires since the beginning of the year. POLL (SOURCE: Anadolu Agency)
