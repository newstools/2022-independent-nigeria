Mikel Arteta has endorsed Arsenal’s push to sign Lyon midfielder Lucas Paqueta, according to reports in Brazil. The Gunners have already strengthened their midfield this summer with the arrival of Fabio Vieira, who joined in a £34 million deal from Porto. But Arsenal are keen to add another midfielder to Mikel Arteta’s squad before the end of the window. Arsenal’s technical director Edu has already approached Paqueta’s representatives and has made it clear that the Gunners want to make a formal offer. According to UOL, Arteta has personally approved Arsenal’s move for Paqueta and the Gunners’ hierarchy are now discussing the financial aspect of the deal. The report also claims that Arsenal and Lyon have already held talks about a move for the Brazil international. It’s understood that Lyon are looking for a €80 million (£67.6m) transfer fee but Arsenal believe a deal could be agreed for significantly less. Paqueta, who is also wanted by Newcastle United, was one of Lyon’s star performers last season with nine goals and six assists and was voted as the best foreign player in Ligue 1. POLL Lyon president Jean-Michel Aulas has already revealed that clubs have made offers for Paqueta and suggested they would not stand in the midfielder’s way. ‘There are proposals for him,’ said Aulas.
