Ukrainian club Shakhtar Donetsk are demanding €50 million damages from FIFA for lost transfer fees. In June, FIFA ruled that foreign players in the country could suspend their contracts until 30 June 2023, because of the Russian invasion which forced the domestic league to shut down. But the club have now appealed to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) arguing they lost money on four players who left the club as a result of FIFA’s ruling. “We had to do this because of FIFA’s highly unfair ruling,” Shakhtar Donetsk chief executive Sergei Palkin told the BBC. “The consequences mean we will continue to lose significant income from deals we expected to close. “We would also like to highlight that given the situation Ukrainian clubs are facing with the war, there has been little respect shown towards these clubs by FIFA. “FIFA has not looked to protect clubs and at no stage consulted with us to find a solution – they have seemingly ignored the perilous state that Ukrainian football clubs have been facing since the beginning of the war.” Shakhtar reportedly had 14 foreign players in their squad and intended to sell some of them in order to raise funds to cover loss of earnings. The club’s appeal to CAS, according to the BBC, apparently states that “the players’ agents advised them to withdraw from negotiations in order to leave the club without any compensation, which would allow them to secure more lucrative arrangements with new employers.”
