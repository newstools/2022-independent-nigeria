ABUJA – A civil society organisation under the umbrella of Coalition in Defence of Nigerian Democracy and Constitution (CDNDC) has called on a presidential aspirant in the forthcoming Nigerian Bar Association (NBA) elections, Mr Yakubu Maikyau to clear air on the allegations levelled  against him in a petition written to the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) alleging his misdeeds. The coalition said the response is necessary to save the reputation and integrity of the association in the forthcoming elections. A group under the aegis of Group Against Corruption had in a petitions dated 14th and 27th of June, 2022,  and published on popularnews9ja.com.ng and other platforms alleged that Mr Maikyau “reneged on the fulfilment of the agreement on a contract sum of NI,310,195,055 awarded by Kebbi State Government to a company in which he (Maikyau) is alleged to have an interest. In the petition signed by one Mr Benjamin David, addressed to the Head of Operations of the anti graft agency said “the contract was meant for the supply of beds to Kalgo Local Government Area of Kebbi State but that the said items were never supplied in full even after collection of an upfront sum of N786,117,033 by Swiss Biostadt, the company introduced to Kebbi Government by Maikyau. The organisation further alleged that Mr Maikyau has “a subsisting retainership with Kebbi State government and he is paid N100,000,00 (One Hundred million) yearly which he has been collecting for seven (7) years without actual remittance of applicable taxes. It was revealed that there was an audit report which “recommended the refund of any monies improperly received from the Kebbi state government.” Consequently, the CDNDC believed that these are weighty allegations requiring the immediate response of Mr Maikyau and which the anti-graft commission must ensure it is properly investigated and acted upon. The  NBA election, according to the CSO, was too important to be distracted or discredited by the allegations of corruption against one of its presidential aspirants. POLL The group insisted that only an immediate response to the allegations could help douse concerns and save the NBA from reputational damage. “Such allegations if uncleared, are strong enough to make the members of the NBA to ask Mr Maikyau to step aside, as a candidate and from participating in the election,” the group warned “
