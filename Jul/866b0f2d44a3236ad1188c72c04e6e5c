YENAGOA – No fewer than eight members of the 2021 Batch ‘B’ Stream 1 of the National Youth Service Corps (NYSC) posted to Bayelsa State would start their service year afresh for absconding from the scheme. The state NYSC coordinator, Adamu Jiya, disclosed this during the passing out parade ceremony of the batch held at the Peace Park in Yenagoa on Thursday. He also said that the mandatory one-year national assignment of seven other members of the batch had been extended due to absenteeism. Jiya, who stated that a total of 1,831 of the 2021 Batch ‘B’, Stream 1 corps members passed out successfully, advised them to be responsible and patriotic citizens of the country. In his remarks, the state Governor, Douye Diri, described the scheme as the shining light of the nation, which boasts of highly educated and patriotic youths. The governor, who was represented by his deputy, Lawrence Ewhrudjakpo, said the NYSC represented the country’s hope for a united, peaceful and egalitarian society. He charged the corps members to remain diligent and patriotic, and to avoid actions that would bring shame to themselves, their families and the NYSC to shame. -Advertisement- POLL Diri promised the state government’s continued support for the scheme to achieve its set objectives in the state.
