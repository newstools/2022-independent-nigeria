Just as the acrimonious and petty allegations continue to trail his much-vaunted presidential bid from the varied opposition camps, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu still remains unscathed and damn unstoppable. In fact, instead of the unfounded and unsubstantiated allegations whittling him down, rather they are strengthening him more, to the extent that many uninitiated in the political space are now joining his fray to be in the winning team. Without any stretch of a doubt, those that matter in the political spectrum are hurriedly boarding his unstoppable train and the picture is getting clearer by the day. His domineering status and magnificence in the volatile political spectrum of Nigeria are spreading like wildfire and who dares confront his moving train. He has craftily traversed the entire political geography and firmament of Nigeria, and many are just impatiently waiting to join his winning team. Popularly known as the Jagaban of Nigerian politics, Asiwaju Tinubu is about to rewrite history with his presidential ambition come 2023. Since his endorsement as the APC candidate, he has become, wantonly or un-wantonly the one to confabulate with for one reason or the other and the bug keeps catching others yet to be in the fray. The theatre is almost set for Asiwaju.
