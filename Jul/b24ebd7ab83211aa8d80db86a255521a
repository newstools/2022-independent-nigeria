Sadio Mane has revealed the welcoming nature of Munich’s citizens played a key role in his decision to leave Liverpool for Bayern this summer. Jurgen Klopp’s side were made aware of Mane’s desire to seek a new challenge away from Anfield and finalised an overall package with the German giants worth just over £35m for the Senegalese star. The Reds will receive a fixed fee of €32m (£27.4m) with a further €9m (£7.7m) in add-ons. €6m of the possible bonus payments will be (£5.1m) based on appearances with the remaining €3m (£2.6m)relating to individual and team achievements. Mane has now linked up with his new team-mates ahead of the 2022/23 season and recently participated in his very first training session as a Bayern player. After being put through his paces at the club’s Säbener Strasse complex, the 30-year-old shed further light on his decision to sign for the reigning Bundesliga champions. Speaking to FCBayern.TV, he said: “When I lived in Salzburg, I used to come to Munich regularly. The people are very respectful and nice. This really impressed me and is important for me. The people have welcomed me, especially here in the club, which has given me extra motivation.” As is always the case after a transfer move, a period of adaption will apply as the jet-heeled forward begins a new chapter in his career. Assessing how his first taste of training with his new employers went, Mane added: “It was really good! I enjoyed it and the other boys enjoyed it too. I’m very happy to be here. Today was our first day together and I’m very excited to start the season. “I’d already met them as an opponent. Now we’re teammates and I’m glad to be able to get to know the boys. Some of them are only coming in the next few days – I’m looking forward to meeting them too and starting pre-season with them.”
