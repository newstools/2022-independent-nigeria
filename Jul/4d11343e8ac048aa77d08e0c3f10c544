LAGOS – In a move that will excite shareholders and stakeholders of the company, the Board and Management of Ardova Plc said it will file its 2021 audited financial statements on or before Friday. The company disclosed this in a filing submitted to the management of the Nigerian Exchange (NGX) at the weekend and signed by the Company Secretary, Oladeinde Nelson-Cole. “The company hereby wishes to allay concerns over the recent suspension of trading of the company’s securities on the Nigerian Exchange Limited (NGX) over the late filing of its 2021 Audited Financial Statements. “The delay in submission was primarily due to the accounting reconciliations that followed the acquisition of Enyo Retail and Supply Limited (ERSL), a transaction which was concluded in November 2021. “Enyo’s accounting has now been harmonized with the IFRS accounting standard already in place at Ardova Plc, following which the group’s Consolidated Financial Statements were completed and duly audited”, the company said. These audited financial statements, Daily Independent learnt, were approved by Ardova’s Board of Directors following its meeting on 29 June 2022, and will be filed with the NGX on or before 8 July 2022. In accordance with NGX rules, Ardova expects that the suspension of trading will be lifted upon submission. “The board and management apologize for the inconvenience caused by this administrative circumstance and reassure our stakeholders and shareholders that Ardova Plc remains committed to the highest standards of compliance and corporate governance, the statement added.
