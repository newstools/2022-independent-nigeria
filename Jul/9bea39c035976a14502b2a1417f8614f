Following the comment made by a controversial On-Air Personality, Daddy Freeze that the Ondo State women resulted to Ogun (gods of thunder) because “Bros J” did not answer them, the General Overseer of the Redeemed Christian Church of God (RCCG), Pastor Adeboye has said anyone who dares blaspheme Jesus Christ, will taste the fire of the Almighty God. It would be recalled that Daddy Freeze while reacting to a video of women raining curses on the attackers of Owo Church noted that the women turned to Ogun because“Bros J” (a nickname for Jesus among Nigerians) did not answer them. Taking to his social media page, Daddy Freeze wrote; “When dem call bros J and he nor answer dem nko? We abandoned African paganism to adopt European pagan ideologies. “Until we start telling ourselves the truth and take our security issues more seriously this won’t end. Christ’s message is love and that’s the first thing so glaringly missing in Nigeria.” Reacting to the development, Pastor Adeboye while speaking at the RCCG Holy Ghost Service on Friday said, “I understand that one funny fellow said that some people were calling on Ogun because Jesus didn’t answer them. “Well, the one who said that there’s a Yoruba proverb, its said, the mouth that the snail uses to blaspheme God, that mouth would kiss the ground. From now on, anybody who dares blaspheme Jesus Christ, they will taste the fire of the Almighty God. “I don’t want to say much because I know whatever I say, some people may want to twist it. But I’ve searched the Bible from cover to cover and there’s nowhere in the Bible where God said a child of God cannot defend himself. “If you find the place, let me know. He said, if they slap you on the right cheek, turn the left. If they now slap the left, what did he say?When God is silent, do you know the meaning of that? It simply means, over to you.”
