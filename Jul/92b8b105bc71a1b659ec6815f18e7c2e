Former Kaduna central lawmaker, Senator Shehu Sani has reacted to the reports that the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) has told the British High Commissioner, Catriona Laing to stay away from the southeast region. Sani via his Twitter account on Friday said that he believes the threat doesn’t reflect the view of the entire people of the region adding that the threat is condemnable. He wrote: “If actually, the separatist group in the South East has issued threats to the British High Commissioner, Catriona Laing not to visit the South East, then that threat is condemnable; and I believe it doesn’t reflect the views of the people of the region except otherwise stated.” Recalls the proscribed Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) had warned the British high commissioner to Nigeria, Catriona Laing to stay away from the southeast region.
