LAGOS – Members of the Ewade Ruling House, Igbooye, have urged the La­gos State Commissioner of Police (CP), Abiodun Alabi, to investigate the Divisional Police Officer (DPO), Noforija, CSP Gregory Ikpehia, over alleged conspiracy with thugs and hoodlums to avoid breakdown of law and order in the community. The family’s petition was con­tained in a letter dated July 14 and entitled, “Save Our Soul, Abuse of Office, Criminal Conspiracy and Perversion of Justice by CSP Gregory Ikpehia, DPO of No­forija Police Station, Eredo-Epe, Against the Head and Principal Members of Ewade Ruling House, Igbooye-Epe.” The petition was signed by Head, Ewade Ruling House, Otun­ba Abdulwasiu Musa-Adebamowo, Principal member and Head, Os­ekelu branch of Ewade Ruling House, Alhaji Mikhail Quadr, Prin­cipal member and Head, Okuyemi branch of Ewade Ruling House, Chief (Mrs.) Kikelomo Oladeji, Principal members, Chief Ligali Ayodele Olatunji and Chief Adeg­benro Otunowo and Family Secre­tary, Abiodun Adekoya. The representatives of the rul­ing house said that they decided to file a civil suit against the thugs and hoodlums as required by the Rules of the High Court of Lagos State, as a result of which pre-action proto­col letters were served on one of the leaders of the thugs, but that, the DPO, CSP Ikpehia, dispatched his men to invite them for questioning on the reasons for wanting to file a civil suit against the suspects. In their petition, the five-man executive committee said they have been representing the interest of the Ewade Ruling House over time, citing various court judgments and rulings, including representations at various court cases, letter of ap­pointment of the head of the family in 2006, reflecting the name of the head of the family and names of some of the accredited representa­tives to back their claims. They alleged that some dis­gruntled and unknown members of the family (names withheld) constituted themselves into thugs and hoodlums, invaded part of the family land at Abapawa, and other related family lands at Legumo, Idotun, Gbojuwara and Talese, in Igbooye, Eredo-Epe and started dis­posing of same to their collabora­tors and other unsuspecting mem­bers of the public, thereby causing pandemonium and commotion in the community.
