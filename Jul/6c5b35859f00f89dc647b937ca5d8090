At least 22 people were killed and 33 injured in a car crash on Tuesday near Egypt’s southern province of Minya, authorities said. The bus carrying around 45 passengers crashed into a stationary truck near the village of al-Barsha, some 300 kilometers (185 miles) south of the capital Cairo in al-Minya governorate, local authorities in Minya said in a statement. “The truck was parked on the side of the road to change a tire when it was hit from behind by the bus traveling from Sohag governorate to Cairo,” a statement from the governorate said. Ambulances rushed to the scene to transfer the injured to hospitals in Minya. Traffic accidents kill thousands every year in Egypt, which has a poor transportation safety record. Crashes are mostly caused by speeding, bad roads or poor enforcement of traffic laws. Some 7,000 people died in road accidents in the country in 2020, according to official figures.
