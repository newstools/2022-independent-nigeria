Ogbomoso Business Roundtable, a nonprofit independent group of business leaders from Ogbomoso, is organizing the first-ever Ogbomoso Economic and Investment Summit with the theme ‘Exploring Economic Potential of Ogbomoso Land: Engage, Collaborate and Invest. According to the Founder/President of the organization, Mr. Benjamin Onigbinde, the inaugural Ogbomoso Economic and Investment Summit is holding in order to highlight economic opportunities in Ogbomoso land to local and international audiences including policymakers, business leaders, academic and finance professionals for a vibrant discussion on the way to improve the economic climate of the city. Billed for the 23rd to 24th of November, 2022, the summit, Onigbinde also said, will provide an open platform for dialogue on how the city’s economy can turn from a seemingly less active to a high-end business environment. He said, “The challenges of economic development of the five local governments of Ogbomoso land are beyond what the local government administration and indigenous entrepreneurs can handle despite various economic potentials in the land. Ogbomoso has faced a prolonged fight against ineptitude growth in recent years with many companies folding up and financial institutions relocating.” He highlighted some other challenges including adequate power supply, unemployment due to a lockdown of industries, road infrastructures, and SME Finance, among others. According to him, the summit aims to sensitize various economic stakeholders to the vast resources that are available in Ogbomoso. “It will bring together business and marketplace leaders, the academic, entrepreneurs, investment groups, government agencies, policymakers and all those with a desire to advance value-based business and economic activities within Ogbomoso to share ideas and create awareness on the varied and diverse opportunities that abound in the second biggest economy in Oyo State,” he said.
