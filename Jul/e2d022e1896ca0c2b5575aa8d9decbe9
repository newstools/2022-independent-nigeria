LAGOS  – Global e-commerce and direct selling leader, QNET, has launched a financial literacy programme aimed at equipping the youth in Nigeria with knowledge needed for socio-economic empowerment. The programme, dubbed FinGreen employs a train the trainers model, ensuring that the information impacted is transmitted to the community for a more sustainable result. FinGreenis designed to impart critical financial management skills and knowledge by training young leaders drawn from various communities to become trainers and champions of financial literacy and economic empowerment among the youth. In partnership with the implementation partner, Financial Literacy for All (FLFA), QNET launched the programme on the occasion of the maiden training session which kicks off the pilot phase of the initiative. Biram Fall, Sub-Saharan Africa Regional Manager for QNET, while speaking at the launch, said, being financially literate today allows an individual to be better poised for certain financial roadblocks which, in turn, reduces the chances of personal economic distress. We developed this programme because sustainability is a core pillar of our values at QNET” “We aim to make a long lasting impact in the communities we operate in and looking at the growing youth population in the country, it is important to ensure that future and current generations have the requisite information needed to make empowered socio-economic decisions. FinGreen focuses on impacting knowledge not just to the pilot group but transmitting the same information to people in their spheres which causes a ripple effect in financial literacy” Mr Abiodun Ajisafe, Managing Director, Transblue and QNETs partner,said: “We know that there is a hunger for economic empowerment among our people. Unfortunately, this hunger is often met with low levels of financial literacy that then leads to mistakes when making investments and financial decisions. It has also become imperative to protect consumers from unethical business practices and this is part of what FinGreen covers”
