The Deputy Senate President, Ovie Omo-Agege, has announced Godsday Orubebe as the Director-General of the All Progressives Congress (APC) Governorship Campaign Organisation in Delta State. Omo-Agege, who is the APC governorship candidate in the state, named Orubebe who is a former Minister of Niger Delta Affairs in a statement on Wednesday. He said Orubebe would bring on board a towering wealth of experience and oversee all ramifications of the campaign ahead of the governorship election in 2023. “Orubebe shall, side by side with me, lead critical engagements and drive consultations, and by his renowned robustness, up the ante for the opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP),” he was quoted as saying in a statement by Ima Niboro, the spokesman for the campaign organisation. “Together with the rest of the team, we shall show PDP the way out of Government House come May 29, 2023. Bringing him on board strengthens the campaign organisation straightaway, and builds a strategic redoubt of crucial stakeholders at the grassroots for the contest ahead.” The governorship candidate added, “When news of Elder Godsday Orubebe’s resignation from the PDP filtered in, June, our campaign organisation applauded him for toeing the path of progress and enjoined him to pitch tent with progressives in the APC and help in the task of taking over Government House come 2023. “I am proud to announce that he heeded that call and joined our party, the APC, in his ward at Burutu Local Government Area. “He will be bringing to our campaign organisation his vast reach at the grassroots, as well as at the state and federal levels, having been a supervisory councillor and chairman of local government, a state party chairman, and a two-time minister of the federal republic.”
