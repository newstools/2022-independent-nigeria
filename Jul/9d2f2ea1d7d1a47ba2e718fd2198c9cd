LAGOS  – Children Empowerment Funds (CEF), a non-governmental organization focused on fulfilling the UN’s Social Development Goals (SDGs) of Good Health and Quality Education in underserved African communities, has partnered with international faith-based organisation, DOXA Foundation to organize a Spelling Bee amongst four primary schools in Makoko, a slum in Lagos. CEF is a sister organization to Mission Enablers Africa, a movement with the mission to ensure that children in underserved communities and highly remote areas in Africa get access to proper hygiene and education, the organization. The Spelling Bee whose goal is to improve the spelling and pronunciation of students of Makoko Primary School, Ayetoro Primary School, Adekunle Primary School, and Fazil Omar Primary school, held on the 26th of May, 2022. Tope Akinrotimi, the Program Manager of Children Empowerment Funds, in chats with Daily Independent, said: “Our focus should not only be on setting them on the path to making a better future. We also need to encourage them today as getting an education in Makoko is challenging enough” According to Akinrotimi, regularly encouraging the children via events like The Spelling Bee will help them focus on getting the best out of school while encouraging those who are out of school to get an education.’ “Recognising that every child has infinite potential, but too many children have only limited opportunities. Moreover, only 0.1% of those who access these opportunities in remote areas access the necessary educational materials to make the most of the educational opportunity. This reality informed the gift the winners of the Spelling Bee competition received,” she added.
