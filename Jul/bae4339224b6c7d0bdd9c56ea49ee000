Anambra State governor, Prof. Charles Soludo, has banned all markets and parks executives from collecting revenue on behalf of the state government. A statement by the Press Secretary to the Governor, Christian Aburime, said Soludo issued the directive at a one-day town hall meeting with transport and market union executive members in the state. The governor, who expressed his determination to block leakages in revenue collection, said his administration will commence implementation of a new tax and levy regime in Anambra markets, roads and parks from today. “The new tax regime will be vigorously pursued to be able to collect all revenues accruable to the state government against the former, which ended in private pockets. “The new tax regime has become imperative, as the era of revenue generation through the sale of crude oil in Nigeria is gradually phasing out”, he said. Soludo warned those posing as government revenue collectors in any part of the state, to desist forthwith, or face the full wrath of the law. He said all public parks owned by the government will be directly managed by the government. He also directed all caretaker committee members in Anambra markets to stop collecting revenue on behalf of the government. The governor pleaded with those who will be affected by the new system to consider the larger picture of making Anambra succeed for the greater good of the people. -Advertisement- POLL Soludo urged the different unions to mobilise their members for action, stating that his administration will not hesitate to enforce the new directive for the general well-being of the state’s economy.
