Muslim Rights Concern (MURIC) said clerics that attended the unveiling of Bola Tinubu’s running mate, Kashim Shettima are not fake. According to MURIC Director, Professor Ishaq Akintola in a statement on Friday in reaction to the dissociation by the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN), he accused the Christian leadership of shying away from reality and living in self-denial. He said, “Going by the findings, it is now very clear that leaders of CAN have distanced themselves from reality. “How low can a religious body descend? What does CAN stand to gain by deceiving its followers? MURIC also listed some of those it maintained are genuine clergymen that graced the APC event. Akintola said Bishop Kamoru is “a real cleric from Peace Chapel, Mararaba”, in Nasarawa State. “A picture has emerged where he was seen conducting a wedding in the church. Some members have come up to say that they knew him personally. “Reverend Father Hyacinth Alia, of Gboko Catholic Diocese, Benue State, is also the APC Governorship candidate. POLL “Pastor Prince Ugokwe, also confirmed that he is a real pastor and not fake. “This shows that a caucus within the leadership of CAN has unleashed tyranny of the oligarchy on Christendom in Nigeria”, the statement added.
