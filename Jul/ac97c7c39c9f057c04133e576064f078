The People’s Democratic Party (PDP) New Generation Group has described the joint ticket of Atiku-Okowa as the best for the country since it balanced the religious equation of both Christianity and Islam, just as they took a swipe at the Muslim-Muslim Ticket of the All Progressive Congress (APC). Meanwhile, the group in a goodwill message signed by the Delta State Coordinator, Efe Ani, congratulated the Governor-Elect of Osun State, Ademola Adeleke, who they described as a credible, resourceful and flamboyant leader. At its enlarged meeting held in Asaba, it was declared that the Atiku and Okowa Ticket is the best, which is needed for the development of Nigeria at the moment. Ani stated that Nigerians are tired of the suffering caused by the APC government, adding that the PDP is the only best available option to rescue Nigerians from the suffering caused by the ruling party. He urged Nigerians to support the PDP in the 2023 general elections and stressed that any attempt to back the APC will prolong their suffering, which will be detrimental to the development of the country.
