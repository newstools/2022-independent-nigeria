The management and staff of Nigerian Content Development and Monitoring Board (NCDMB) have expressed sadness over Tuesday’s death of the secretary general of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), Mohammad Sanusi Barkindo. In a statement on Thursday, the executive secretary of NCDMB, Kesiye Wabote, said Barkindo’s demise had left the board in deep shock. Wabote described the late OPEC boss as “an international icon, an unparalleled intellectual and pacesetter in the energy sector.” He said further: “Your untimely death has left us in deep shock, especially after sharing close moments with us at the 2022 NOG and once again experiencing your rare brilliance and deep insights into the present state and future outlook of the energy industry. “Generations will revere your legacies and the international energy industry will remember that a giant walked these paths.” The NCDMB boss also prayed for the repose of the soul of Barkindo. The group managing director of Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), Mele Kyari, had on Wednesday announced the passing away of Barkindo, who was preparing to round off his tenure at the OPEC. Kyari, in a tweet, said: “We lost our esteemed Dr. Mohammad Sanusi Barkindo. He died at about 11pm yesterday (Tuesday), July 5, 2022. Certainly, a great loss to his immediate family, the NNPC, our country Nigeria, the OPEC and the global energy community. Burial arrangements will be announced shortly.”
