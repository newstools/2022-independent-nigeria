Asiwaju Tinubu, a National leader in the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) and frontline Presidential aspirant was Governor of Lagos State between 1999 and 2007. -Advertisement- SWAGA had travelled across the South West and now has established in other parts of the country, being the first group to root for the Tinubu’s Presidential ambition before the APC National leader eventually made the public pronouncement. In a statement signed by Hon. ‘Bosun Oladele (MHR) National Secretary of SWAGA’23 and made available to the media on behalf of SWAGA through Hon. Rotimi Makinde, the group would accordingly launch the Kwara Chapter in less than 48 hours in the state. The terse statement read in full: “SWAGA’23 Inaugurates Kwara State Chapter.

POLL Reacting to the official launch in Kwara, Chairman of SWAGA Senator Dayo Adeyeye said, “SWAGA is now a household name, a movement that has taken over entire Nigeria’s political space. As you can see our affiliate here is the NORTH CENTRAL AGENDA for ASIWAJU 2023. If All Progressives Congress (APC) conducts any primary for the presidency today, Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu will win, he is a man with capability, a man who doesn’t forget his people and who has made many leaders from among his subordinates I must reiterate that SWAGA’23/NCA is the right way to go. “They said it is indirect primary that the party will adopt to choose its Presidential flagbearer, that makes us happy. If it is indirect too. Asiwaju is ready. No one can rig anything. We understand grassroots politicking. “Naysayers and mischievous people have now accepted that Asiwaju has a strong home base. And that is very true. He has a strong home base indeed. “We have visited over 300 Obas (traditional rulers) and they have prayed and blessed Asiwaju. People and other groups across the country have keyed into this agenda. And I can tell you that, we already have over 14 million votes in our pocket,” he said.
