The Bayelsa State chapter of the All Progressives Congress (APC) has once again dismissed the news report making rounds that former President Goodluck Jonathan has officially defected to the party from the opposition People’s Democratic Party (PDP). The state APC Chairman, Dennis Otiotio, who spoke on Thursday while reacting to media reports purporting that Jonathan had formally joined the APC to contest the 2023 presidential election on the platform of the party, however, dismissed the speculation. Reports on Thursday had also quoted the APC Chairman in Jonathan’s ward 13 in the Ogbia Local Government Area of Bayelsa, Freeman Igori, as having confirmed that the former president formally joined the party on Wednesday, May 11, 2022, in his Otuoke country home. -Advertisement- Otiotio, in a telephone interview, however, said that Jonathan was officially not yet a member of the APC in the state. He stated that the former president could only become a member of the APC when the National Chairman of the party, Adamu Abdullahi, had granted him a waiver. Speaking further, he said he was not aware that Jonathan had been given a waiver by Abdullahi to join the APC to contest the presidency. The state APC chairman said, “I think the person you people should be asking the question is the national chairman of the party. He should be the one to grant him (Jonathan) a waiver. “As of now, he has not officially joined our party. Ask the national chairman if he has granted him a waiver.” POLL However, Otiotio described Jonathan as “a big fish and an elder statesman”, adding that it will be great if he finally joins the APC ahead of the general elections.
