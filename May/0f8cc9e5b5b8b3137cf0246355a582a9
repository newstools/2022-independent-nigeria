The Peter Obi Support Network (POSN) has described recent reports that former Anambra State Governor and presidential aspirant on the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) ahead of the 2023 elections, Peter Obi, is being considered as a vice presidential candidate for another presidential aspirant as mere wishful thinking from a desperate support group in the PDP. The group also said the presidential ambition of the former governor of Anambra state is not negotiable. POSN, in a statement signed by its spokesman, Sani Saeed Altukry, also warned the leadership of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), against playing games with the unity of the country by considering such comprise. -Advertisement- “Any attempt by the party to foist a northern candidate on the party members will adversely affect the future and fortunes of the party at the 2023 presidential elections and hurt the already shaky foundations of the country,” the group said. Peter Obi Support Network (POSN) further asked Mr Peter Obi, who it believes has mass appeal and is loved by the generality of Nigerians to consider Sokoto State Governor, Aminu Waziri Tambuwal, former Senate President, Bukola Saraki and Bauchi State Governor, Bala Mohammed as potential vice presidents when the time for taking the decision comes. “Peter Obi’s presidential ambition is not negotiable because he has repeatedly assured us and other Nigerians that have consulted with him on the matter that he is in the presidential race to win. “However, we are not surprised by the media report because Nigerians are aware that Atiku appreciates Obi’s sterling presidential qualities which were why he chose Obi as running mate in 2019,” the group said.
