Sweden and Finland have “very, very strong support” from Turkey’s NATO allies in their bid to join the alliance, Swedish Foreign Minister Ann Linde told reporters on Friday. Sweden hopes to get unanimous support for its application, Linde said. Among Sweden’s supporters are important NATO members with whom Turkey has an interest in maintaining good relations, she said. Linde’s comments come after Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan announced Turkey’s opposition to the two Nordic nations joining NATO. -Advertisement- Finland has already declared an intention to join NATO “without delay”, and Sweden is expected to follow suit as early as Monday, Reuters reported. Finnish Foreign Minister Pekka Haavisto told reporters that on Saturday he was to meet with his Turkish counterpart Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu, who is attending an informal meeting of NATO foreign ministers in Berlin over the weekend. Pentagon Spokesman John Kirby said Erdoğan’s comments did not change Ankara’s standing in the alliance. “In terms of the comments President Erdogan has made, we’re working to clarify Turkey’s position,” U.S. State Department Assistant Secretary for Europe and Eurasian Affairs Karen Donfried told reporters.
