LAGOS  – The Lagos State Government has stated that it would activate the relevant section of the State Urban and Regional Planning and Development Law 2019 as amended to effect the seizure of the site of the recent building collapse at 24 Ibadan Street, Ebute-Metta. Dr. Idris Salako, the Commissioner for Physical Planning and Urban Development, made this known during a meeting with the ministry’s enforcement team in Alausa. Salako commiserated with families of those that lost their lives and others that sustained injuries in the ugly incident. -Advertisement- He stated that the State Government was investigating the circumstances surrounding the collapse and would not hesitate to activate the forfeiture clause should the property owner be found culpable. Before the four-storey building collapsed in the night of Sunday May 1, the Lagos State Building Control Agency( LASBCA) had served statutory notices relevant to a distressed building in occupation which culminated in the seal up of the building. However, the Tenants of the building refused to move out, claiming they had issues to sort out with the Landlord, while the Agency, upon noticing the break of seal, further served demolition notice in preparation for removal of the building. Salako expressed concern at the rate at which disregard for law and order was hitting deep into our social fabric and causing untold hardships, adding that the Lagos State Government was determined to uproot the menace, especially in the built environment, where it had declared incidents of building collapse intolerable. He enjoined Lagosians to join hands with the Government in maintaining vigilance in the built environment of the State by reporting any untoward developments in their vicinity through any of the Ministry or State Government communication channels.
