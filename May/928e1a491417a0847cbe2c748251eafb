Karim Benzema has revealed his cryptic response to Kylian Mbappe’s decision to snub Real Madrid. Mbappe, who is in the final weeks of his current deal with Paris Saint-Germain, has been Real’s chief transfer target for the last two years and held positive talks over a move to the Bernabeu just last week. But in a sensational U-turn however, the 23-year-old is now set to commit to a new three-year contract with PSG. -Advertisement- A move to Madrid would have seen Mbappe form a fearsome attack alongside international teammate Benzema, who has been in incredible form for Los Blancos this season. As news emerged that Mbappe is set to reject a move to Spain, Benzema shared a telling image on his Instagram stories of his hand pointing towards the Real Madrid badge – with Real fans viewing it as a clear dig aimed at the PSG star. Real had a £200million bid for Mbappe rejected last summer but have been in constant contact over a summer move. The Spanish champions looked set to land Mbappe – withdrawing from the race to sign Manchester City-bound Erling Haaland such was their confidence in getting the deal done. Mbappe’s decision has prompted a furious response from Javier Tebas, the president of La Liga, who has branded PSG an ‘insult to football’. POLL ‘What PSG’s doing by renewing Mbappe with large sum after giving losses of €700m in recent seasons and having more than €600m of salary bill, is an insult to football. ‘They are as dangerous as the Super League.’
