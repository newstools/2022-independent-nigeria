LAGOS – Alliance of Yoruba Democratic Movements, (AYDM), an alliance of some 121 different Pan Yoruba groups has advised the Presidential aspirants in the South West to prune down the number of aspirants to at least two candidates, stating that the multiplicity of candidates may rob the region the slot of the Presidency in 2023. The group in a statement signed by Popoola Ajayi, AYDM’s General Secretary, said the Northern leaders in the APC appear to have designed the architecture that will lead to the South West political waterloo in the coming primary slated for the end of May. “There is a conscious attempt to set the South West against itself. With some six aspirants contesting on the All Progressives Congress, (APC) alone, the prospect of the next President emerging from the South West is dim,” the statement reads.” -Advertisement- AYDM also calls on the South West leadership to employ credibility and public acceptability as the yardstick to arrive at a consensus candidate, stating that the people of the South West to prepare to move to another political party if the APC failed to produce a Presidential candidate from the region. “The people of the South West have no other option than to leave the APC if the party fails to pick its Presidential candidate from the region. “It will be another sign of treachery and a confirmation that the alliance of the South West and the North in 2015 was in bad faith. It will show clearly that the core North can never be trusted now or in the future” Ajayi said. The group however said that some of the aspirants have no basis to even collect the forms except for the purpose of deepening the crisis of selection in the APC South West.
