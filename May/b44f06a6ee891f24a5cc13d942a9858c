The state Police Spokesman SP Muhammed Shehu stated that the offense took place at Tungar Dutsi village in Bukkuyyum Local Government Area of Zamfara. He said, “On May 3, police in Bukkuyum Division responded to a distress call from Tungar Dutsi Community in Gana district of Bukkuyum Local Government Area. Some members of the outlawed group from Tungar Bido village led by their notorious leader, Bala Minister, invaded Tungar Dutsi village armed with locally-made guns and other dangerous weapons. -Advertisement- “They claimed they were celebrating Sallah and started shooting sporadically, causing panic and fear within the community. When some members of the community cautioned them against the sporadic shooting, the outlawed group members escalated their nefarious action to attacking people with cutlasses, knives, and other dangerous weapons.
