For failing to recognise his art, Nigerian rapper, Akinbi Bamidele Brett, otherwise known as Superboy Cheque has called out the organisers of the popular Headies Award. The award organisers had, during the week, released the nominees’ list for this year’s edition, drawing reactions and criticisms from music buffs and artistes alike. Taking to his Twitter handle, Cheque accused the award organisers for not giving his art the recognition it deserves, stating that their actions is one of the reasons why hiphop has remained stagnant in this part of the world. He wrote; “Another year and the Headies fails to recognize my music in the Rap category, while melodic rappers like Durk and Roddy are idolized in the rap scene worldwide That’s why hip-hop has remained stagnant here. But it’s calm. I will still be dropping hits even if I don’t get my Flowers.” -Advertisement- Commenting on his post, popular Twitter user, Daniel Regha agreed with the artiste noting that the award has since lost its credibility due to favouritism as against merit. “The Headies award has long lost its credibility because nominations and wins are now based on favouritism instead of merit; So as an artiste pays little attention to awards, winning ’em doesn’t equal greatness or makes one a standout. Make timeless music, that’s far greater than awards,” he opined.
