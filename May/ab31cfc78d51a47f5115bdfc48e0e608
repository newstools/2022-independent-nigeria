P/HARCOURT  – Hon. Farah Dagogo, the detained governorship as­pirant of the Peoples Dem­ocratic Party (PDP) in Riv­ers State, would remain in police custody until May 23 following the adjournment of his case by the chief magistrate due to the law­maker’s absence in court on Monday. Femi Adegbite, counsel to Dagogo, had applied for bail at the magistrate court but was opposed by the prosecution counsel. The lawmaker is facing a two-count charge of conspir­acy and cultism in the case brought against him by the state Commissioner of Police, Friday Eboka. -Advertisement- On Monday when the mat­ter was called by Chief Mag­istrate Amadi Nna, he was informed by the lawyer to the Rivers State Government, Chidi Eke, that fresh informa­tion had been filed against the federal lawmaker at the state High court.
