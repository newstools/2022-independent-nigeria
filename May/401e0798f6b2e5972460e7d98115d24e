The leadership of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Bayelsa State Chapter on Tuesday revealed that former President Goodluck Jonathan is at liberty to join the party but is yet to do so. The Chairman of the state chapter, Dr Dennis Otiotio disclosed this while reacting to the alleged presidential ambition of the former president on the platform of the ruling party and the purchase of the N100 million nomination and expression of interest forms. Otiotio spoke against the backdrop of moves to draft Jonathan into the 2023 presidential race, saying that the APC in Bayelsa was not aware of Jonathan’s membership. -Advertisement- He, however, said the ruling party is willing to receive the former president into their party ahead of the 2023 general elections. According to him, “The former president is not yet a registered member of APC. He is free to join any party of his choice. “We are open and willing to receive him into our fold, as a political party desirous of winning elections, the only way to go is by admitting people into the party,” Otiotio said. This comes after a coalition of northern groups called Nomadic Pastoralists and the Almajiri Communities led by Ibrahim Abdullahi purchased the APC presidential nomination and expression of interest forms for the former president to contest the 2023 elections on the APC platform. However, in a statement by Mr Ikechukwu Eze, Media Adviser to Jonathan on Monday night, the former president dissociated himself from the move and said that Jonathan did not authorise the purchase of the form. POLL According to the statement, Jonathan was not consulted on the procurement of the APC nomination in his name and rejected it.
