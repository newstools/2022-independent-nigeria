LAGOS – Aero Contractors has denied the claim in some quarters that it is planning to shut down operations over industry challenges. The airline in a statement by its management said that the airline could not be isolated from the current challenges facing the industry and promised its clients, travelling public and stakeholders that it would continue to operate in the industry. The statement hinted that high cost of aviation fuel, high foreign exchange rate; high maintenance cost, inflation and low purchasing power of the traveling public following the increase of fares were some of the challenges facing its operations. -Advertisement- The statement added: “Like many airlines in Nigeria, Aero Contractors have been operating daily, and facing the challenges squarely. “We categorically deny any plan to close operations as the airline is proactively taking necessary measures and strategy to continue operation and ensure a great travel experience to our highly esteemed customers.” The airline said that it has one of the best Maintenance Repair Overhaul (MRO) facilities in West and Central Africa, adding that it remained the oldest aviation company with capacity to offer both scheduled airline services and maintenance for third party, licensed in over three countries.
