Journalists in Ekiti and Osun states have been enjoined to prioritize their safety, and give accurate accounts of political events before, during and after the off circle Governorship elections. This was the focal point of a three-day training organised for select journalists in the two states by the Media Support Centre (MSC). The media professionals were also encouraged to drive conversation around credible and violence-free elections, as well as good governance. -Advertisement- They urged the journalists to guide the media and civil society groups to lead advocacy for the emergence of credible candidates and a healthy political environment. Speaking on Journalists’ rights, the Head of Training Faculty, MSC, Professor Tunde Akanni, cautioned journalists against being unnecessarily critical of political gladiators and to embrace fact-based reporting. Professor Akanni equally enjoined them to protect their right to free speech, enshrined in Chapter 4, section 39, 1999 constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, as amended. “Journalists are to be cautious and careful in their coverage of the opinion polls by not publishing false news. “It is their responsibility to also protect their right to free speech, covering polls. POLL Another facilitator, Mikhail Mumuni in his presentation on journalists’ safety warned them against being partisan. “Don’t be an activist more than partisan participants. Know the environment you are covering because you can’t cover news at the stronghold of another party else, the violence we are preaching against would spring. Olukayode Thomas also implored journalists to follow the trail of the Politicians in order to give accurate reports to their host communities in case of fund misappropriation.
