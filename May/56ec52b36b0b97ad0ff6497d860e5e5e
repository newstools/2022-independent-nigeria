A recent report from Diario Sport has offered a detailed update on Barcelona’s renewal with Ousmane Dembele. It appears the two parties are still locked in negotiations over a new deal and currently working together in an attempt to reach an agreement. Both parties realise they must make some sacrifices in order to reach the end goal. For Barcelona, they had initially made a renewal offer which was rejected by Dembele as the sum offered in the deal was not significant enough for the player. -Advertisement- The report suggests Barça are now working on making a second offer, which they believe could convince Dembele. But the offer hinges on multiple factors, one of which was to qualify for the Champions League. Thanks to the 2-1 win over Real Betis, that goal has been reached and the club are expected to receive a significant bonus from the league for securing a top-four finish. The other key factor remains unresolved, as it twirls around Barcelona’s prospects of a new and fairly controversial sponsorship deal with CVC Capital, and the sale of Barça Studio. If the club succeed in their plans to reach an agreement with CVC, it could land them a significant financial injection, effectively putting them in a position to come up with a second offer for Dembele. The Catalans, though, are not willing to outrightly increase the terms offered in the first bid. Rather they are looking to increase the number of variables and performance-related add-ons. POLL Dembele’s representatives and the player himself have shown a willingness to lower his demands. And as such, Barcelona remain confident of tying the winger down to a new contract, although with just three weeks remaining until the end of May, the club must move swiftly.
