Following the recent happening in the All Progressive Congress APC camp, the Deputy Speaker of the Kano State House of Assembly, Zubairu Hamza Massu, has dumped the ruling party. The party has been hit by a wave of defections since Governor Abdullahi Umar Ganduje anointed Nasiru Gawuna, his deputy, to succeed him. The deputy speaker, who is representing Sumaila Local Government from Kano South in the assembly, announced his resignation from the APC in a letter addressed to the ward chairman of the APC, Massu town. -Advertisement- The letter read, “Following the recent happening in the party coupled with a series of consultations with my constituents, supporters, and stakeholders in Sumaila and Kano North in general, I write to notify you of my intention and decision to resign as a member of APC. “The decision is mainly due to unjust treatment, inadequate internal democracy and total marginalization of Kano south from a lot of opportunities.’’
