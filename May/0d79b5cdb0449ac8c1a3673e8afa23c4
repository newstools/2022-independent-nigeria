The Nigerian Economic Sum­mit Group (NESG) has pro­posed a six-point agenda to nudge Nigeria’s prospective political actors towards actu­alising the immediate yearn­ings of Nigerians and effecting sustainable economic change. Mr. Asue Ighodalo, Chair­man of the NESG, stated this at the weekend in Abu­ja at the National Economic Dialogue organised by the NESG, which was attended by high-profile political lead­ers, private and public sector stakeholders, civil society organisations and the aca­demia. The NESG’s six-point agen­da urges the government to rethink what socio-economic development outcomes mean for an average Nigerian, re­think the role of market and the private sector and deepen sectoral reforms to support broad-based growth and com­petitiveness. -Advertisement- Other points of the agenda called for the nation’s leader­ship to facilitate integrated national and sub-national approach to economic inclu­sion and development; prag­matic and actionable social sector reforms and develop workable and inclusive na­tional security strategy in all dimensions.
