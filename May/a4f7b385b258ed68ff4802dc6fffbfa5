LAGOS – The Hon. Minister of State, Labour & Employment, Barrister Festus Keyamo, SAN, has opined that it is better to reward loyalty rather than procuring. He shared this view on his official twitter handle, @fkeyamo today, May 21, 2022. He wrote; “It is better to reward loyalty than to buy it because loyalty that is purchased is mere transactional loyalty that’ll remain unstable whereas loyalty that is displayed over time without strings attached and is finally rewarded is emotional and stable loyalty.” -Advertisement- See tweet below;
