A former presidential aspirant on the platform of the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) and former Anambra State Governor, Peter Obi on Monday clinched the presidential ticket of the Labour Party (LP) ahead of the 2023 general elections. His emergence as the party’s flagbearer follows his victory at the presidential primary of the party after a total of 185 delegates had been accredited to vote in the exercise to elect one of four aspirants seeking to clinch the party’s presidential ticket. During the presidential primary election of the party held in Asaba, Delta State on Monday afternoon, fellow aspirant Professor Pat Utomi declared his resignation in favour of Obi, who joined the party after pulling out of the presidential race of the opposition party. -Advertisement- Speaking on the reason for his decision, Utomi said that he was stepping down in favour of a younger candidate who has the ability to bring about the critical changes in the Nigerian system. According to him, the Labour Party primaries marked the beginning of Nigeria’s liberation. Another aspirant on the platform of the party, 45-year-old Joseph Faduri, had already spoken but returned to the podium to support Peter Obi. It could be recalled that Obi clinches the party ticket barely a week after he announced his resignation from the PDP and withdrawal from the primary election of the main opposition party. Meanwhile, former Vice-President Atiku Abubakar, whom Obi ran alongside in the 2019 presidential election, eventually picked the ticket of the PDP. POLL More details later…
