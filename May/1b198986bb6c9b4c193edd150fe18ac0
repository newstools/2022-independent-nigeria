But upon the driver’s failure to produce the export document, the truck was detained at our headquarters and was later released on the compassionate ground with the owner promising to return the product to their warehouse for domestic consumption. “But upon the release of the truck, they went and translated the content into this very truck we intercepted in order to beat our officers’ checks,” he said.
