RB Leipzig star Christopher Nkunku has hinted that he could be on his way back to former club Paris Saint-Germain this summer, calling the club his ‘home’. Nkunku spent four years in PSG’s first team between 2015 and 2019, playing 55 games for the club before signing for RB Leipzig. After a few decent seasons in Germany, Nkunku really broke though in 2021/22 – scoring 35 goals in all competitions and winning the Bundesliga player of the season award. Due to this form the French forward has been linked with a whole host of clubs ahead of the summer transfer window. -Advertisement- Speaking to L’Equipe while on international duty with France, Nkunku added fuel to those rumours, saying: “It’s flattering to have the biggest clubs in the world interested in me. But it’s also flattering that Leipzig are doing everything to keep me. “Here we are in June, in the national team, and I’m focused on this gathering [with the French national team]. The transfer window is not open, I do not focus on it. “Afterwards, as I have always said, PSG is my home, my heart club, where I was trained. I don’t close any doors. Everything is possible in football.” 90min reported back in March that PSG were interested in re-signing the former academy graduate from Leipzig as a part of a summer rebuild. A lot, however, will depend on where Ousmane Dembele ends up. PSG are one of a number of clubs interested in the Barça man, who also has suitors in England and Germany. POLL Les Parisiens’ interest originates from sporting director Leonardo, but he is expected to be sacked and replaced by the renowned Luis Campos – who is not among Dembele’s admirers and may prefer a move for Nkunku.
