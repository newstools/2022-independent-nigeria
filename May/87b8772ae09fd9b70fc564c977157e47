According to Akabe,” Peace and security we are enjoying in Nasarawa State is the effort of traditional rulers. I want to call on all citizens in the state not to al­low security to be a one-man business; we are aware of the unfortunate incident that happened on Friday along Gudi Akwanga Road. “This time politics is heat­ing up. I want to employ all citizens of this state to main­tain peace, Nasarawa state belongs to all of us, some will win, some will lose, those who lost should take the de­feat in good faith,” Akabe noted. Justice Sidi Bage, the Emir of Lafia, who was also in attendance during the jubilee celebration of His Royal Majesty Dr. Ayuba Agwadu, said the present ad­ministration has kept all the traditional rulers together and that was the reason why Nasarawa state is regarded as a peace loving state in the country.
