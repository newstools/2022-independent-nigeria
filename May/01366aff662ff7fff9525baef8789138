LAGOS – The Forum of Political Parties (FPP) in Lagos, made up of the leadership of registered and de-registered political parties, has condemned in the strong terms the recent statement made by Professor Ishaq Akintola, leader of the Muslim Rights Concern (MURIC) on the endorsement of Governor Babajide Olusola Sanwo-Olu of Lagos State for a second term in office by the Governance Advisory Council (GAC) of his party, the All Progressive Congress (APC). The FPP said that Professor Akintola’s statement was unnecessary, divisive, provocative and an assault on the sensibilities of the good people of Lagos State who see themselves as brothers and sisters with religious tolerance among themselves right from the beginning. Akintola had in a statement expressed MURIC’s displeasure over the governor’s second term endorsement by the APC’s Governance Advisory Council, describing it as unfair and provocative. FPP, in a statement issued by its chairman, Kola Ajayi, enjoined MURIC to get it facts right next time before making uninformed criticisms. It said from 1999 till date, Muslims had been governor for 16 years, and Christians had only been there for eight years. “Moreso, MURIC leader must understand and appreciate that Lagos is a secular state and not made up of only persons of the Christian and Islamic religious faiths only, but also people of other religions and beliefs.”
