When asked by the Indian newspaper whether United were hoping to come on board as investors, Ganguly said: “No, no (they are coming) as an owner. “It takes some time. First, let it reach a stage then we will make a comment. -Advertisement- “I will speak only after there’s a concrete development.” East Bengal finished ninth in their league last season, a disappointing result which has led to them searching for new owners.
