Mikel Arteta is happy Arsenal’s push for a place in the Champions League remains in their own hands — despite their defeat at rivals Tottenham on Thursday. Arteta and Arsenal fell to a 3-0 defeat to Spurs at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium. The loss in the North London Derby means Spurs are one point behind Arsenal in the race for the top four. However, if Arsenal can win their last two games — against Newcastle on Monday and Everton next Sunday — then they will play in Europe’s elite club competition next season. -Advertisement- And Arteta is happy with their situation: “Two games and two wins is a good place to be.” The Spaniard is also taking the positives from Thursday’s loss: “Obviously losing like that is always painful. “But, as well, you learn a lot, probably more than with any victory. So it is good to go through those moments, sometimes. “We knew that losing was a possibility. To get into the position that we are in, a lot has happened in the past. We have been through it, we have experienced it. Hopefully that can help us on Monday.” Arsenal will be without Rob Holding on Monday due to his sending off against Tottenham, while Ben White and Gabriel are also doubts due to injuries.
