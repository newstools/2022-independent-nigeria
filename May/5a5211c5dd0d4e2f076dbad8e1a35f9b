The People’s Democratic Par­ty (PDP) youths numbering over 300 from Oleh Ward I and II in Isoko South Local Gov­ernment Area of Delta State have staged a peaceful protest barricading the busy Oleh roundabout over the alleged substitution of the names of its elected ad-hoc delegates. The blockage caused heavy vehicular traffic gridlock as the road was closed to traffic for over one hour while secu­rity operatives made frantic efforts to ensure peace while the protest lasted. The Isoko youths display­ing placards with various inscriptions such as “Okowa is a good leader”, “Okowa is a peaceful leader”, “Oleh dele­gates’ list should not be tem­pered with” and “Leave Oleh delegates’ list,” insisted that the ad-hoc delegates’ list must reflect the election, which was conducted in the presence of the PDP Ward Chairman for Oleh Ward One, Lucky Uk­peowe and Ward Two, Idog­ho Paul; leaders, youths and stakeholders, who elected three ad-hoc delegates each from the two wards.
