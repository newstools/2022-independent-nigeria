As exclusively revealed by Reshad Rahman, journalist Toni Juanmarti has claimed that Barcelona are interested in signing Manchester City midfielder Bernardo Silva, but can only do so on only one condition. The 27-year-old is enjoying a stunning season at the Etihad Stadium and has been key to the Cityzens’ title defence and the semi-final run in the UEFA Champions League. Barcelona, who had been linked with a move for Silva last year, have once again set their sights on the Portuguese international heading into the upcoming summer transfer window. -Advertisement- However, signing will not be easy for the Blaugrana, given their financial situation at the moment. And, Toni Juanmarti has claimed that the only way that Xavi Hernandez & co. can land the former SL Benfica ace is if they sell Frenkie de Jong in the summer. The Dutchman’s future has become a subject of intense speculation of late, with contradicting reports emerging on his situation at Camp Nou. While the manager and club officials continue to insist that de Jong remains a part of the club’s future, media reports claim that Barcelona are open to selling de Jong should an offer of around €70 million come along. Carlos Soler of Valencia had been identified as a replacement, with reports even stating that an agreement with the Spaniard over a move. However, Silva’s name has now entered the picture, but the only hope of signing would come from de Jong leaving the club. At the same time, Manchester City would not be willing to sell their prized asset without putting up a strong fight either. With his contract running until the summer of 2025, the Premier League leaders are in a strong negotiating position as well. POLL So, it remains to be seen if there is any progress made in Barcelona’s pursuit of the 27-year-old midfielder or they decide to stick with de Jong.
