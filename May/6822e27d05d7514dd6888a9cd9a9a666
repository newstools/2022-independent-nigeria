LAGOS – Coach Emmanuel Deutsch has charged the players of Sun­shine Stars of Akure to sustain their goal-scoring form after they defeated Katsina United 2-0 at the weekend. Azeez Ajagbe and Leonard Ugochukwu were on the score sheet as the Owena Waves end­ed a five-game winless streak at the Akure Township Stadium this weekend. It was a result many thought would be celebrated by the club but the Akure club, Deutsch, was not in any such mood for celebrations, insisting the plac­ing of the club at the end of the season will determine the mood. -Advertisement- Deutsch did cut a relieved figure at full time was quick to dedicate the win to fans of the club. “The victory is for Sunshine Stars fans. Everyone had been waiting for it and I am glad we have found the nets again. I am not happy yet, at least not until the end of the season when I know where the team finished. “We are now scoring goals. I hope we continue this way. In the past few days, I saw strong connection and support from the fans. I really hope we can continue this way,” he conclud­ed. The Owena Whales went into the game under some pressure having failed to win a game since April, and the run looked set to continue following a goalless result at half time of the Nigeria Professional Foot­ball League (NPFL) match-day 30 fixture. However, Ajagbe lashed on a loose ball to give Sunshine Stars a 58th-minute lead before Ugo­chukwu was brought down in the box, and the former Heart­land FC attacker stepped up to convert the resulting penalty kick in the 85th minute.
