In her first public appearance in two months, Queen Elizabeth II appeared to be in good spirits as she attended the Royal Windsor Horse Show on Friday. Arriving at the event in her Range Rover, the all-smiles head of state chatted with several people from the vehicle’s window at the equestrian show, where her horse, Balmoral Leia, won the title of supreme champion. Cameras captured the queen in delight upon receiving a gold cup for her horse’s win at the event held at the Windsor Castle grounds. -Advertisement- The 96-year-old queen has cited mobility problems for her lack of attendance at recent events, including her medically advised absence on Tuesday from the State Opening of Parliament. It was Elizabeth II’s first time missing the event in 59 years. She delegated her role of delivering the Queen’s Speech at the event to her son, Prince Charles. The last time the longest-reigning monarch was seen in public was in March during a commemoration of her late husband, Prince Philip, who died last year.
