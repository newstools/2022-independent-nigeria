I held him in high regard until I had to ask him why he was treating me the way he was. I asked him, what do you have against me, that is making you sleep around and with my best friends! Kaffy further revealed that she found her peace by not sleeping with him after she found out he was cheating on her. “I stopped sleeping with him because he was dishonest with me and it was when I stopped sleeping with him, that the greatest level of healing started,” she said.
