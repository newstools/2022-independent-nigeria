Liverpool striker Divock Origi was denied a farewell to the club’s supporters at Anfield. While Jurgen Klopp had talked up the Belgian in the build-up to Sunday’s Premier League finale at home to Wolves, Origi missed out due to a minor muscle injury. The 27-year-old, a cult-hero amongst supporters, will leave the club at the end of his contract next month and is widely expected to join AC Milan on a free transfer. -Advertisement- Mohamed Salah, meanwhile, returned to the bench in a promising sign ahead of next weekend’s Champions League final with Real Madrid. Salah was forced off injured during the FA Cup final win over Chelsea but is fit enough to make the squad for a game Liverpool simply must win to stand any chance of winning a second League title in two years. Should Klopp’s side better Manchester City’s result as Anfield legend Steven Gerrard takes his Aston Villa team to the Etihad Stadium.
