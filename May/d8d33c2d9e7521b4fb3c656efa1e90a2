The Lagos State government has warned against a video circulating online, showing officials of the Rapid Response Squad (RRS) and the Environmental and Special Offences Unit (Task Force) at the Alaba-Rago Market area of the state. According to a statement by Gbenga Omotoso, Commissioner, Ministry of Information and Strategy, the video is accompanied by a voice, which is not that of any official of the two agencies. The commissioner said the voice is that of a faceless blogger trying to whip up ethnic and political sentiments over the planned relocation of traders for the remodelling of Alaba Rago Market. -Advertisement- He said, “The video is authentic because Commander, Rapid Response Squad (RRS), CSP Olayinka Egbeyemi and Chairman, Lagos State Task Force, CSP Shola Jejeloye, were in Alaba Rago last Thursday to brief the traders on the planned relocation. The traders have 14 days to vacate the area to pave the way for the re-modelling. “Alaba Rago is occupied by traders from many parts of Nigeria and neighbouring West African countries. Any insinuation towards any ethnic attack is a lie and purveyors of such are mischievous. It is a devious attempt to cause trouble among peaceful traders. Such actions should be disregarded. Engagements are ongoing towards a hitch-free temporary relocation of the traders. “The planned relocation is part of the Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu administration’s Urban Renewal Programme. Lagos State Government and the Federal Ministry of Works and Housing have just demolished market stalls under Apongbon Bridge ahead of the reconstruction of the bridge, which got burnt. “It is illegal to bring ethnic, religious or political colourations to such an exercise, which is designed to ensure development and better security in our communities.”
