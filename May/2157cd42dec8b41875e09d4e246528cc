The Champions League had yet another magical night in store for us on Wednesday when Real Madrid made an impossible comeback to beat Manchester City 6-5 on aggregate and seal the ticket to the final. The Spanish giants were trailing 4-3 on aggregate throughout the majority of the game, struggling to make the breakthrough despite immense pressure. They even ended up conceding a goal from Riyad Mahrez, which made it 5-3. But a late cameo from Rodrygo saw him score two goals in two minutes late in the game. His quickfire double helped Real Madrid drag the game to extra time, with Karim Benzema eventually capitalising on a penalty to seal the win for Los Blancos. -Advertisement- Reacting to Real Madrid’s triumph in this live stream, Sergio Aguero revealed the texts received from Lionel Messi shortly after the Benzema goal. The former Manchester City striker was live-streaming the game along with another ex-Man City frontman Carlos Tevez. “Leo (Messi) texted me,” said Aguero during his stream. The Argentine when on to reveal the text to his viewers, with Messi expressing his shock following Real Madrid’s comeback victory over Man City. “‘You’re messing with me… there’s no way’ he says,” Aguero responded when asked about the text by Tevez. Messi’s PSG side were beaten by Real Madrid similarly in the earlier round, with Karim Benzema starring in the fascinating second leg matchup that saw him score a hat-trick to send Los Blancos to the semis. POLL Thanks to the win over Man City this midweek, Real Madrid will now lock horns with Liverpool in the final at the end of the month, in what will be the rematch of the 2018 Champions League final. Real Madrid had triumphed on that occasion, thanks to a Gareth Bale masterclass. But the Reds have a score to settle when they meet Carlo Ancelotti’s men once again in Saint-Denis later this month.
