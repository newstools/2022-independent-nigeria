In the build-up to the delegates’ convention of All Progressives Congress (APC) slated for 30th May 2023, the frontrunner for the Presidential ticket of the party, Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu, is not leaving anything to chance at all. The former Governor of Lagos and National leader of the APC has been in the news for the past week for very good reasons. He was in Kano, Taraba, Adamawa, Kastina, and now Yobe State to meet with the party’s delegates, canvass for their support and fraternize with them ahead of the primaries. -Advertisement- A higher number of delegates’ votes come from the Northern States and it is believed that Tinubu is in the good books of those States based on antecedents and past relationships with the people and their leaders especially the level of strategic support and network mobilized by him in ensuring the emergence of APC as a party and President Muhammadu Buhari from 2014. As the date draws nearer and in view of the ground to be covered, SWAGA’23, as a foremost support group for Tinubu’s presidential bid, has begun consultation with delegates from the South, starting from the South-West, to ensure that no one is taken for granted and no stone is left unturned. The group, led by Senator Dayo Adeyeye, is extending its support to Asiwaju at this time to these critical stakeholders to ensure that the goal of 2023 is achieved for its principal according to a statement issued by Adeyeye. Adeyeye further said, “Here is a man that some said is too old for the job and some meddlesome interlopers have adjudged as “sick” moving into every nook and cranny of the country to seek support while those touted as fit are becoming clay-footed. Experience, knowledge and determination are the key factors to get things done and Asiwaju has them all.” The race is becoming interesting every day while analysts keep a close watch.
