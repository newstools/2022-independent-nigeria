Speaking at the official signing ceremony of the sponsorship in Lagos on Tuesday, the Chief Executive Officer of Bitnob, Bernard Parah, believes the partnership would link his organisation to the people who need solutions and also help them to work with the NPFL to develop the league. “Bitcoin, just like football, is about hope, oneness, and freedom, and at Bitnob, we are excited to be making this happen to inspire hope and showcase possibilities in our own league. If we don’t believe in what is ours, then who will?. -Advertisement- “We are young investors and are happy with the willingness of the League Management Company to partner with us in order to give the league a facelift.
