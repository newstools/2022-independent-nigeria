The All Progressives Congress (APC) Professionals Council, Director-General, Seyi Bamigbade, has said the return of Lagos4Lagos Chairman, Sunday Ajayi, to the party marked the end of the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) in Lagos State. Bamigbade stated this on Sunday while playing host to the Chairman of Lagos4Lagos Movement, Ajayi, who recently defected to the APC. Recalling that the leaders of the group within the Lagos APC held parallel party congresses in 2021 before defecting to the PDP in January, the council director said Ajayi’s return to the APC with his teeming supporters dealt deadly blows to the PDP. -Advertisement- “I welcome you back to our fold.

He said his members are fully back into the APC to participate in all the party’s polls both primary and general elections as card-carrying members of APC.
