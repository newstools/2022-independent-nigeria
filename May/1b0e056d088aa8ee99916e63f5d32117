Juventus are ready to ask Atalanta for Colombia international Luis Muriel, according to La Gazzetta dello Sport. The Bianconeri are completely revamping their front line following the January arrival of Dusan Vlahovic from Fiorentina. Paulo Dybala has been released from his contract, Alvaro Morata and Moise Kean probably won’t remain either after their loans with options to buy from Atletico Madrid and Everton respectively. -Advertisement- The hunt is therefore on for strikers who can work well either with Vlahovic or as his replacement during squad rotation. La Gazzetta dello Sport maintain Muriel could be the one, having just turned 31 last month and eager for a new challenge after three years with Atalanta. The Colombia international can play either as a centre-forward or in support of one, and is known for his super-sub tendencies more than when it comes to leading the line from the start. His contract runs to 2023 and his rapport with coach Gian Piero Gasperini can be tense, but he still scored 14 goals and provided 10 assists in 39 competitive games for La Dea this season. Inter had shown an interest last year, but Juve have an advantage now Atalanta are out of Europe and Muriel would reunite with his good friend and fellow Colombian Juan Cuadrado in Turin.
