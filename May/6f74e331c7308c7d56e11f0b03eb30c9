Nigerian comedian, Ayo Makun, popularly known as AY, has revealed the reason for the rift between him and his colleague, Bright Okpocha aka Basketmouth. According to the comedian while answering questions from his fans via his his Instagram page, Basketmouth has been battling with an uncontrollable Superiority complex and he has been avoiding him. The Instagram user, @chijiokeukaigwe asked, “Do you really have any issues with Basketmouth?” -Advertisement- “I don’t have issues with Basketmouth but people having unnecessary issues with you are the price you sometimes pay for being progressive. “He has been battling with an uncontrollable Superiority complex for the longest. So, avoiding his incessant childishness only became necessary for my own sanity,” AY responded. Another fan @so_sahh asked, “In other words the both of you don’t talk? The comedian replied by saying, “We only talk to those who want to talk to us. Does this make sense?”
