Twitter’s share price falls 18 percent after Elon Musk places his takeover on hold until more data is provided about fake accounts on the platform. Elon Musk has once again shocked the stock markets with his announcement that he is putting his $44 billion takeovers of Twitter temporarily on hold. The reason Musk cited was him waiting for more information about spam and fake accounts after Twitter late last month said that less than 5 percent of Twitter users are spam or fake accounts. -Advertisement- Meanwhile, it is reported that Twitter has instituted a hiring freeze, and two senior executives have left the social networking platform, which was not their decision, ahead of the takeover. Musk announced his decision to place the Twitter deal “temporarily on hold” in a tweet on Friday morning. Shares in Twitter fell 17.7 percent to $37.10 in premarket trading, their lowest level since Musk disclosed his stake in the company in early April and then made his ‘best and final offer to take it private for $54.20 per share. Twitter had disclosed its spam and fake account problem in its quarterly SEC filing on 28 April, when it estimated that fake or spam accounts made up fewer than 5 percent of the platform’s active users during the first three months of the year. Twitter said at the time that its estimates were based on a review of sample accounts and it believed the numbers to be ‘reasonable.’But its estimate had not been independently verified, and there is the risk that the true figure could be higher.
