LAGOS – Former minister of power, Prof.Barth Nnaji, has stated that the creation of regional grids will solve Nigeria’s erratic power supply. He added that the regional grids would ensure reliable and quality power supply. He expressed discontent over the nation’s low power generation capacity. -Advertisement- “I was quite sad to hear that power had dropped to below 4,000 and in the 300,000 range, and we as a nation shouldn’t be talking about 3,000, 4,000, 5,000mw of power in a country of 200 million people,” he said. “So, yes, we cannot have just national control of power. You can have a national power grid, but there should be regional grids, and there is nothing in the constitution preventing it. “States don’t have enough money to build their own power plants except maybe Akwa Ibom and Rivers states and the smaller plants built by Lagos state, but typically, it’s very costly and capital intensive. “But if you have regional grids, then states can now work with the private sector to build reliable power projects. “What we have done in Aba is an illustration of this. What we’ve done in Aba is to demonstrate that you can have the same autonomous power utility, and that’s what we have in Aba. We have improved distribution network and infrastructure, billing system and also a situation where the customers are metred.You can have that in different places, reliable, quality electricity.”
