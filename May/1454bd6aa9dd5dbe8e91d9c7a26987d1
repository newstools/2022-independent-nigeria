The All Progressives Congress Professionals Council, Direc­tor-General, Seyi Bamigbade, has said the return of Lago­s4Lagos Chairman, Sunday Ajayi, to the All Progressives Congress (APC) marked the end of the People’s Democrat­ic Party (PDP) in Lagos State. Bamigbade, stated this while playing host to the Chairman of Lagos4Lagos Movement, Ajayi, who recent­ly defected to the APC. Recalling that the leaders of the group within the Lagos APC held parallel party con­gresses in 2021 before defect­ing to the PDP in January, the council director said Ajayi’s return to the APC with his teeming supporters dealt deadly blows to the PDP. -Advertisement- “I welcome you back to our fold. Welcome to our great par­ty and congratulations on tak­ing the right decision. We are very optimistic that with this feat, we have overrun and con­quered the PDP in Lagos State.” Bamigbade also urged them to be upright and con­tinue to contribute their quo­ta to the development of the party as the APC prepares for its elections directly or indirectly to take the party to greater heights. Earlier, Ajayi thanked Bamigbade for his tireless efforts in mobilizing profes­sionals into the ruling party throughout Nigeria. He said his members are fully back into the APC to participate in all the party’s polls both primary and gener­al elections as a card-carrying member of APC. Ajayi, who noted that he and his followers were happy to return to the APC, promised to work with the leadership of the All Progres­sives Congress Professionals’ Council to achieve greatness.
