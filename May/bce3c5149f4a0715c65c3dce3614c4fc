ONITSHA – In defiance of the order of Governor Chukwuma Soludo to end touting in Anambra State, especially in motor parks, markets and roadsides across the state, the touts have fully returned to the commercial town of Onitsha and its environs on immeasurable dimension. At Bridge-Head section of Onitsha, truck drivers were being charged N14,000 before they were allowed to continue with their journey, while some stopped the vehicular movement and parked them at the FRSC compound, beside Ogbo Abada Market, Onitsha. At Onitsha/Owerri Road, the story was the same as touts who had disappeared following Soludo’s directive when he took over as governor, now harass commercial vehicle drivers, demanding huge amount of money ranging between N2,000 and N5,000 had finally returned with incessant beating of commercial drivers. At Ochanja area of Onitsha, it was reported that the touts collect as much as N13,000 from truck drivers plying the route. The return of touts had thrown residents, tricycle riders and other commercial drivers into panic as was the case during the administration of former Gov. Willie Obiano.
