President Muhammadu Buhari’s wife, Aisha Buhari alongside the wife of Vice President Yemi Osinbajo, Dolapo Osinbajo and the Minister of Women Affairs, Pauline Tallen stormed the All Progressives Congress (APC) National Secretariat in Abuja. The trio were warmly welcomed by the National Chairman of the party, Abdullahi Adamu who subsequently ushered them in for a closed-door meeting. The First Lady who spoke on Monday while stating the reason for their visit said that they were on a solidarity visit to congratulate the Adamu for the opportunity to lead the party. -Advertisement- Aisha Buhari, however, called on the APC Chairman not to forget women in all elective positions ahead of the 2023 general elections. Speaking, she said,  “We are here to congratulate the National Chairman for the opportunity God has given him to lead this great party and to thank him for the good work he has started. “Finally, we are encouraging him not to forget women in all elective positions.” The Women Affairs Minister on her part emphasised that women’s role is critical in national development and all elective positions. Tallen, however, declined to speak on why she dropped her senatorial ambition and the president’s stand on the issue. POLL It could be recalled that Pauline withdrew her senatorial ambition after a group purchased the Senatorial form of the ruling party for her.
