ABUJA – The House of Representa­tives’ Public Accounts Com­mittee has commenced inves­tigation into the multi million dollar debt owed the Federal Government by terminal operators and the failure of the Nigeria Port Authority to account for billions of naira accruing to the nation. The Committee Chair­man, Oluwole Oke, asked the management of the Nigeria Ports Authority to explain why such a huge amount of money owed the Federal Gov­ernment by terminal opera­tors has not been recovered and paid into the federal treasury. The investigation is in response to 12 audit queries from the office of the Auditor General for the Federation on the financial statement of the NPA for the 2019 fiscal year. -Advertisement- So far, the NPA manage­ment has only responded to one of the 12 queries from the office of the Auditor General on the indebtedness of termi­nal operators to the govern­ment to the tune of 852.094 million dollars and N1.897 billion. In its response to the sub­ject, the NPA said the sum of N269.410 million of the N1.8 billion has been recovered while the balance of N1.6 billion “invoices processed on the encumbered areas re­main unpaid”. It said further that, “the sum of $504,663,452.37 is vol­ume change on fix lease fee payment by APMT, arising from clauses in the conces­sion agreement between NPA and APMT — out of the total sum of $852,093,730.77. “Bills raised on encum­bered areas which remained unpaid is $19,169,459.00. The following has been paid- GMT-$54,707,700.08, unpaid penalties- $11,922,642.68 and unpaid VAT-$28,693,707.07”. “$92,533,518.72 has been re­covered leaving unpaid lease and Throughout fee in the sum of $139,970,637.71 (made up of $113,982,486.82 and $5,988,150.89) respectively,” the agency submitted. POLL However, not satisfied by the explanation, the commit­tee directed the NPA manage­ment to come and reconcile their position with that of the Auditor General for the Fed­eration and provide evidence of remitting the recovered N269.51 million and $92.534 million to the treasury. The NPA is also to furnish the House with contract agreement/Service Levy Agreement, the list of all ter­minal operators as well as a comprehensive schedule of lease fee, Throughput fee and GMT that makes up the total amount being owed the government by the operators.
