Chief Edwin Clark, leader of the Southern and Middle Belt Leaders Forum (SMBLF) has said that any governor, former governor or politician who accepts to be a Vice Presidential candidate to any Presidential candidate from the Northern part of the country during the 2023 general election will be considered as unpatriotic and that person will be handled by God. Clark, who is also the leader of the Pan Niger Delta Forum (PANDEF) said that Nigerians want to look at Governor El-Rufai’s report on restructuring, pointing out that it is time for President Muhammadu Buhari to summon a town hall meeting where all Nigerians will be there to discuss El-Rufai’s report. The elder statesman who spoke on Arise Television on Tuesday said that he issued a press statement on Monday where he and other regional groups spoke extensively on the need to zone the Presidency to the South and why it amounts to calling for the break up of the country for the Northern elders to ask that the issue of zoning be buried. -Advertisement- While making a case for zoning, Chief Clark said that sometime this year Governor Nasir El-Rufai of Kaduna State said on a national/satellite Television station, Channels Television, that zoning of the party and political elective offices exists in the All Progressives  Congress (APC), pointing out that the Governor also hinted that all the positions earlier held by the North would be swapped with the South and vice versa,  including the presidency. Clark wondered why only Northerners vied for the National Chairmanship of the party, which was zoned to the North and micro zoned to the North Central, during the party’s National Convention in March and when the time came to zone the Presidency they are claiming that zoning should be jettisoned. The PANDEF leader warned that claiming that zoning should be jettisoned at this point would amount to threatening the nation’s unity and that zoning is serious and warned that it cannot be swept under the carpet. “We have made our point known to them that zoning cannot be buried and if they are thinking that it is a joke, they should better know that it is not except they want to joke with the unity of the nation,” he said. He maintained that they are going to abide by the established principle of rotation and zoning between the north and south, otherwise they would go back to what they were as a people, before the amalgamation of 1914.
