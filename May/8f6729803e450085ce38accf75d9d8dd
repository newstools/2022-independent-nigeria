****Shocked Over Traumatized School Children ****Urges Relevant Agencies To Rescue Trapped Victims ****Promises A Strong, Virile Nigeria Come 2023 -Advertisement- The New Nigeria People’s Party (NNPP) on Tuesday decried an alleged gas explosion in the Sabon Gari area of Kano State where four persons reportedly lost their lives and others injured. The party said that it received the news of the incident with shock as “our heart bleeds over this tragedy that affected a nursery and primary school with traumatized children running for their lives.” In a statement, NNPP urged security agents and relevant government agencies to ensure that those trapped in the debris of the collapsed buildings are rescued and given adequate medical treatment, NNPP urged that school children traumatized by the explosion should also receive proper medical care. The statement also noted that “Nigerians expect dividends of democracy not carnage; adding that the “Kano State Government, indeed, governments at all levels in Nigeria should ensure that those dealing with combustible and inflammable materials are not permitted to operate near schools to avoid a recurrence of this tragedy.” “The safety of all Nigerians should be a priority in considering business premises permits and approving schools. This is in tandem with Section 14(2)b of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria 1999, as amended, which provides that the security and welfare of the people shall be the primary purpose of government,” it added. POLL This is as it promised to usher in a new Nigeria built on “a strong, virile, united, prosperous, equitable and decent democratic society,” if voted into power, in 2023.
