Former minister of Niger Delta Affairs, Usani Usani has explained that due to continued constriction of the governorship space in the ruling APC in Cross River State, he had to leave to pursue his long-held ambition in the Peoples Redemption Party (PRP). In an interview with Journalists in Calabar, Usani who was one of the two governorship candidates of APC in 2019 said, “It is the constriction of the democratic space in the state that has occasioned this expediency.” Usani who has been a diehard member of the Action Congress Nigeria, which metamorphosed into APC, lamented that he had expended his time, resources and energy to build the party until ‘strangers’ invaded it. -Advertisement- “We built up the All Progressives Congress (APC) and the members of the APC are not my enemies.” It would be recalled that Usani was one of the 17 gubernatorial aspirants for the APC ticket in the state. A 7-man committee had pruned the number to four, after which about two weeks ago, the party caucus selected Prince Bassey Otu as its consensus candidate. This seemingly angered other frontline aspirants. To pacify them, the party has now agreed to conduct primaries to have an acceptable flagbearer next week.
