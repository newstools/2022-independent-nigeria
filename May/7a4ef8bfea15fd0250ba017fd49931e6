A United States lawyer of Nnamdi Kanu, leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra, IPOB, Bruce Fein has urged Facebook to ban the Nigerian Government. According to him, Facebook should consider placing a ban on the Nigerian Government for alleged genocide and crimes against humanity perpetrated against IPOB and the people of the southeast. Daily Post reports that his appeal was in response to the call by Lai Mohammed, the Minister of Information and Culture, asking Facebook to ban IPOB from using the social media platform. -Advertisement- Mohammed had said Facebook was not doing enough to bar IPOB from inciting violence using the platform. Fein in a letter he addressed to Mark Zuckerberg, founder of Facebook said, “I am aware of the Nigerian Government’s high decibel clamour for Facebook to ban IPOB and its members from the social media platform for allegedly inciting violence. The clamour is predicated on the Nigerian Government’s proscription of IPOB as a terrorist organization in September 2017. The whole story is more revealing. “The proscription flouted due process. IPOB was denied notice and an opportunity to respond. The proscription was the fact-free ipse dixit of Nigerian President Muhammdu Buhari. “Accordingly, I am respectfully requesting that Facebook rebuke the Fulani-controlled Government of Nigeria for seeking censorship of IPOB’s free speech. “Facebook should also consider banning the Government of Nigeria as a criminal enterprise featuring genocide and crimes against humanity against Biafrans and other ethnic or political groups. The incriminating evidence is voluminous and will be supplied on request.”
