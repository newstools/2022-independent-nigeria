UEFA has announced that Frenchman Clement Turpin will referee the Champions League final between Liverpool and Real Madrid. The match, taking place in Paris on 28 May, will be the 39-year-old’s first Champions League final. He has officiated in seven Champions League matches this season, including Chelsea’s quarter-final first leg against Real Madrid in which a Karim Benzema hat-trick saw the visitors run out 3-1 winners. -Advertisement- He also has experience of refereeing fellow finalists Liverpool this season, taking charge of their 2-0 win over RB Leipzig in the last 16 second leg. Turpin will perhaps be most familiar on these shores to Manchester United fans as he oversaw their Europa League final defeat to Villarreal last year. The agonising loss came 11-10 on penalties, with goalkeeper David de Gea blasting his penalty over the bar. Turpin has also shown he is not afraid to reach for his cards to maintain discipline on the pitch. He brandished three red cards in the space of eight minutes after a huge brawl broke out in Porto’s Champions League group tie against Atletico Madrid in December. Rangers fans will also remember Turpin’s vital intervention as he awarded Giovanni van Bronckhorst’s side a penalty following a VAR review that put them 1-0 ahead in their eventual 4-2 victory at Borussia Dortmund, one of the greatest European nights in the Glasgow club’s history. POLL UEFA also announced that Slavko Vincic will referee the Europa League final between Rangers and Eintracht Frankfurt, and that Istvan Kovas will officiate the Europa Conference League final between Roma and Feyenoord. Lina Lehtovaara will take charge of the Women’s Champions League final between Barcelona and Lyon.
