AWKA – The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has said that Nigeria is now a beggar nation judging by her current socio-economic and political woes. That was the crux of the matter at Hollywood Event Cen­tre, Awka, when Governor Bala Mohammed of Bauchi State outlined several reasons Anam­bra State PDP and the citizens should support his presidential ambition to redeem the dented image of Nigeria, once known as the giant of Africa. The Bauchi State governor, who was in Anambra State said Nigeria is currently indebted to China and other countries of the world, lamented the country had been taking so much loans which were not deployed to the benefit of Nigerians across the country. -Advertisement- Mohammed also noted that all the states, including the Federal Government had been struggling with poorer nations to get aids and grants from America and the rest of the world, adding that the cur­rent status quo was not the profile of the Nigeria that was handed over to the present day Nigerians by the first republic politicians. He said Nigeria used to be the big brother of the African continent and had secured the independence of Zimbabwe, Namibia and South Africa and was taking care of the needs of her neighbours and was also re­spected globally and regarded as the number one investment destination in the African con­tinent.
