Sterling Bank Plc, one of Nigeria’s leading commercial bank, has signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the Nigerian Optometrist Association (NOA) to automate operations, enhance capacity and provide funding at competitive interest rates for members of the association. Mrs. Ibironke Akinmade, Group Head, Health Finance of Sterling Bank, while speaking at the signing ceremony of the MoU in Lagos recently, said the initiative is part of the bank’s vision to be the leading bank for businesses in the health sector. She said: “We have adopted a community approach in engagement with stakeholders in this sector. This will not only give us leverage to develop tailor-made propositions for the community, but it also creates an inroad for engagement of their members through a cluster approach.” -Advertisement- Akinmade said the bank recently engaged the NOA in a bid to scale on its offerings to the health sector, which include access to finance (template credit), access to digitalisation (payment platforms and Electronic Medical Records) as well as advisory services, among others. The Head of Health Finance said the rationale behind the partnership with NOA is to further position Sterling Bank as the bank of choice for businesses in the health sector, adding that this means more business collaboration and partnership with stakeholders in the health space. She said the bank has earmarked N10 billion for the entire health care sector in the country and would accommodate any level of funding which members of the NOA may require. Under the MoU, members of the association will be able to borrow from the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) intervention for the health sector at five percent as well as obtain template credit from the bank within 48 hours at competitive interest rate of 20 percent, which is below the prevailing rate in the banking industry, she said. Since 2018, Sterling Bank has concentrated investment in five sectors of the economy under its HEART’s strategy in a bid to make impact in the country’s economic development. The five sectors in the HEART’s strategy include health, education, agriculture, renewable energy and transportation. POLL Dr. Obinna Awiaka, President of NOA, also speaking, said the association wants a bank that would help its members to grow and discovered that Sterling is the only bank that has passion for the healthcare sector. He said the relationship between members of his association and the bank will build the economy because once the healthcare industry is built the economy will also be built.
