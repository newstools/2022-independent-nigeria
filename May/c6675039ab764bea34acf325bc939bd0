Pope Francis appeared at his general audience in a wheelchair for the first time since his colon surgery. The pontiff was escorted by wheelchair to his appearance on Thursday – the first time he’s needed such support since his surgery in 2021. Pope Francis, who remained in high sprits, spoke to nuns and religious superiors at Paul VI Hall. The talk was centered on “vulnerability” for laity and clergy, and encouraged listeners to examine their own limits and weaknesses. “Like Peter and with Peter, we are now called, after recognizing our vulnerability, to ask ourselves what are the new vulnerabilities before which we, as consecrated men and women, must lower ourselves today,” the pontiff said.
