Stakeholders in the Poultry industry in Lagos earlier in the week gathered at the 500-seater hall of the Lagos State University of Science and Technology, Ikorodu to discuss the way forward for the sector post COVID. The two day annual symposium had it’s theme: Post COVID-19 Effects On Poultry Industry: Way Out. Godwin Egbebe, Chairman Poultry Association of Nigeria, Lagos State Chapter in his welcome address said that most of the farmers are closing shop because they could no longer cope. -Advertisement- “The COVID-19 affected all the sector of the economy, but that of poultry is more diverstating because our own business is more volatile compare to other business. “The maize we bought for N160,000 two years ago when the CBN intervened and gave us some maize to stabilise the market is now N270,000 per tonne, so you can see that that is almost 100% increase and we as a farmer cannot sell the product at that same increase, we cannot even increase our prices up to 30 percent because nobody will look at it, so it is affecting us and people are closing shop,” he said. Speaking further Egbebe stated that one of the major problems is that those that are producing grains cannot go to their farms because of bandits. Oluranti Sagoe-Oviebo, Lagos state Project Coordinator of APPEALS said the Project is collaborating with PAN on different levels. She encouraged the farmers to look inward that Lagos has large expanse of land that are not tapped into, that farmers can even go into the production of maize. POLL “Today we are supporting PAN with egg powered machine where they can actually change their eggs into powered. That will help to address the issue of glut in the industry.”
