Ten men have been arrested by detectives investigating alleged football match-fixing in the League of Ireland. Several residential properties have also been searched in a planned Garda operation. The men, aged from their early 20s to their 60s, have been detained on suspicion of the offence of conspiracy to defraud contrary to common law. -Advertisement- The operation, titled Brookweed, focused on the Dublin metropolitan area and the Garda’s southern region, which comprises Cork, Kerry and Limerick. Undertaken by the Anti-Bribery and Corruption Unit within the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau, the operation was described as a “day of action” against match-fixing. The arrested men have been held at Garda stations across the targeted areas. The operation stemmed from an investigation carried out by detectives attached to the Anti-Bribery and Corruption Unit in 2019. That investigation was prompted by reports of suspected match-fixing received from the Football Association of Ireland and Union of European Football Associations. POLL Commenting on Wednesday’s operation, Detective Superintendent Catharina Gunne, from the Garda National Economic Crime Bureau, said: “Match-fixing and corruption is a threat to all sports at all levels and undermines public confidence in the fairness of sport. “It can allow organised crime to infiltrate sport in order to use it to make illicit gains or launder proceeds of crime.”
