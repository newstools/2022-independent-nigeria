Arsenal have made one change to their starting lineup for today’s Premier League clash with Leeds. That alteration comes in defence, where Nuno Tavares drops to the bench as Cedric Soares starts at left-back. Ben White is still absent for Arsenal, meawhile. The England defender has not trained properly this week and also missed last Sunday’s win at West Ham with a hamstring issue. -Advertisement- Gunners boss Mikel Arteta was hoping White could train on Saturday and then return to the squad for today’s visit of struggling Leeds to the Emirates Stadium. Eddie Nketiah once again leads the line for Arsenal and Rob Holding starts in the heart of defence. Gabriel Martinelli keeps his place after impressing against West Ham, with Emile Smith Rowe having to make do with a place on a youthful bench.
