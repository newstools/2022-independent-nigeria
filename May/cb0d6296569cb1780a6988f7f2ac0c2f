The Chief of Army Staff (COAS) Lieutenant General Faruk Yahaya has charged troops in the ongoing counter-terrorism and insurgency Operations in North East to remain dogged and unrelenting in the critical stage of ongoing operations. He gave the charge at Headquarters Joint Task Force (JTF) North East (NE) Operation Hadin Kai (OPHK), Maiduguri on Sunday. In a press statement signed by Brigadier-General Onyema Nwachukwu, Director of Army Public Relations said that the COAS who was on a routine operational visit to the JTF OPHK to assess the level of success recorded thus far called on troops to be more decisive in routing the criminal elements from their enclaves. “Gen Yahaya arrived at the theatre of operations in the company of some principal staff officers, where he was given an update on the ongoing Operation DESERT SANITY and Operation LAKE SANITY. He expressed satisfaction with the successes so far, urging them to remain vigilant and proactive during the Eid-el-Fitr Celebration”. General Yahaya enjoined troops to continue to decimate the insurgents and deny them freedom of action. This he said, will provide a safe environment and opportunity for other elements of national power to play their statutory roles in the fight against terrorism and insurgency in the theatre. The COAS conducted a round of inspection of some combat equipment recently revamped using the Nigerian Army Electrical Mechanical Engineers Corps repair capability.
