In a bid to improve healthcare delivery at the grassroots, the Lagos State Government has employed 925 health workers in a recent recruitment exercise undertaken by the Lagos State Primary Health Care Board (LSPHCB). The Permanent Secretary of the Board, Dr. Ibrahim Akinwunmi Mustafa, disclosed this during an induction programme for the new staff, adding that the newly engaged health workers cut across different categories of health professionals and cadres, including Medical Doctors, Pharmacists, Nurses, Community Health Extension Workers, Laboratory Scientists and Technicians, Environmental Officers and Health Information Management Officers. He said: “The employment of the new set of health workers by the Lagos State Primary Health Care Board will increase manpower of the Primary Health Care Centres across the State in view of the high level of staff attrition”. He stated that the increased manpower will bring about an improvement in health care service delivery in Lagos State, as there is an influx of people, particularly from the neighbouring States that share boundaries with Lagos and want to benefit from its improved medical services.   Dr. Mustafa further stated that the administration of Babajide Sanwo-Olu is concerned about the implementation of a comprehensive health care delivery in the State, stressing that health is one of the important pillars in the T.H.E.M.E.S Agenda of the Lagos State Government. While noting that the employment of additional hands will definitely close the shortage gap in manpower at the PHCs across the State, the Permanent Secretary averred that the Board also plans to employ more health workers in the immediate future to contend with population growth and personnel exist due to voluntary and statutory retirement from service.
