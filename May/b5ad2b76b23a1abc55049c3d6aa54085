A group under the auspices of Concerned Nigerian Citizens (CNC) has said that the indecision of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) and the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) on presidential zoning ahead of the anticipated 2023 general election is threatening the unity of the country. The stakeholders of the coalition made this known on Tuesday in Abuja while addressing newsmen ahead of the two major political parties’ primaries slated for May 2022. Speaking through its convener, Femi Osabinu, the group called on the political gladiators across ethnic nationalities to stop dividing Nigerians via exchange of words on power rotation. -Advertisement- Speaking, he said, “We have also noticed how unstable and highly political most of our political parties are responding to the call for power rotation. “This has made us come together to lend our voice to the voice of reasoning, the voice of a unified and greater Nigeria by urging all concerned political parties to zone the presidency to the South. “Since the return to civil rule in 1999, there has been an unwritten conventional way for power rotation between the North and the South. “It baffles us that as the debate intensifies and parties’ national conventions draw nearer, most political parties are planning to play down the zoning arrangement with selfish excuses of population spread across the country.”
