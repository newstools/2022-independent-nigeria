Real Madrid are more optimistic than ever that Kylian Mbappé will join the club this summer after positive talks in recent days. Mbappé’s contract at Paris St-Germain expires next month and Madrid are confident he will turn down an extension and move to the Bernabéu. The Spanish champions’ most recent negotiations included productive discussions on image rights. The 23-year-old said on Sunday a decision would be announced “well before” he joins up with France for June’s Nations League matches. “I will give my decision very quickly; it’s almost over,” he said. “My choice is almost made.” -Advertisement- Mbappé joined PSG from Monaco in 2017 in a deal worth up to €180m and has established himself as one of the world’s finest players. PSG rejected several offers from Madrid for him last summer, the last worth €200m on deadline day, and have tried to persuade him to continue with the club. PSG’s sporting director, Leonardo, admitted last August that Mbappé had wanted to leave but said Madrid’s initial offers did not meet their valuation and that they were not willing to do business in the final week of the window. Mbappé scored for PSG in both legs of their Champions League defeat by Madrid this season. Madrid have already secured one notable free transfer, doing a deal to bring in the defender Antonio Rüdiger when his Chelsea contract ends. PSG have Paul Pogba on their list of potential signings and have held talks over a possible move for the midfielder, who is leaving Manchester United. On Monday Pogba’s agent is due to have discussions with Juventus over a potential return for the 29-year-old, with the player’s salary a key point. Pogba is not minded to consider a switch to Manchester City at this stage.
