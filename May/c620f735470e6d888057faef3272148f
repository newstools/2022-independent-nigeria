The Muslim Rights Concern (MURIC) has condemned the killing of a Hausa woman along with her three children in Anambra State. In a statement, MURIC Director, Prof. Ishaq Akintola, said the killing is condemnable. He said, “It is brutish, horrendous, and barbaric. No family deserves to be wiped out in this manner,” -Advertisement- “In particular, we ask the British Embassy in Nigeria and other Western sources to condemn this ugly incident with the same vehemence that they condemned other killings. “In the same vein, we charge all social critics who have condemned other killings to speak up against this latest brutality. We call for fairness in comments on developments in Nigeria. Selective condemnation of evil cannot bring peace either to Nigeria or to the world at large,” he said. Akintola said MURIC has never been selective in its assessments, being the first to condemn the killing of Deborah Samuel. “Nigeria needs peace at this crucial time. Therefore, nobody should embark on reprisal killing. It will only compound the problem,’’ he added.
