One person was killed and five others sustained injuries, when a small plane crashed onto a bridge and collided with a car, in Miami, Florida, USA, on Saturday. The tragic accident took place before noon on the Holfer Inlet Bridge, and resulted in the closure of traffic on the bridge. Federal Aviation Administration officials said there were three persons on board the single-engine Cessna 172 and losing its engine caused it to crash, colliding with a vehicle, and then burning, according to Alvaro Zabaleta, a Miami police spokesman. -Advertisement- Two people got off the plane while the body of the only victim was found after the fire was extinguished, Narciso Torres, 36, who was an air traffic controller at a control tower in Miami. Rescue officials reported that 5 people were injured, including two who were on board the plane and taken to a local hospital. A Miami police spokesman explained that a woman and two children, 2 and 6 years old, were in the car and were taken to the hospital, but their injuries were not serious. The spokesman pointed out that it is a miracle that a vehicle collides head-on with a plane and everyone was fine, but it is bad that we lost someone in the accident.
