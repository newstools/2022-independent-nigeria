Barcelona have informed young forward Ferran Jutgla that they will exercise the option of extending his current deal to another year, but the formalities will only take place at the end of the season, according to Mundo Deportivo. Jutgla, whose current Barcelona contract ends at the end of the season, has had a decent run-in in the first team this term, having made nine appearances across all competitions while scoring two goals However, thanks to incoming cavalries in January, the 23-year-old moved back to Barça B, where he has gone on to score 18 goals and five assists in 29 outings. This translates to a goal every 137 minutes. -Advertisement- He is, in fact, almost single-handedly leading the charge for Barcelona B’s promotion. They have gone from flirting with relegation to level on points with 6th-placed Atletico Baleares, with a game in hand. At 23 years of age, it is only valid for him to think of becoming a first-team regular and his situation has rightly attracted a decent interest. However, Barcelona have made it clear that they wish to execute the option of the additional year, but the management will only sit down to talk at the end of the season. Both Barcelona and the player are currently open to everything. This includes right from being promoted to the first team permanently to being transferred in the summer if there is, in fact, an acceptable offer. The possibility of the former, however, mostly depends on the exits. POLL MD says the likes of Luuk de Jong, Adama Traore and Martin Braithwaite will not continue beyond the ongoing season, but the arrival of a new face could hamper his playing minutes since Ferran Torres and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang are simply untouchable. Despite all this, the player understands the team has other priorities to take care of. This includes contract renewals of the current first-team regulars and hence, he is only focusing on the bigger picture at hand, which is to earn a promotion with Barcelona B.
