At least eight people died on Friday when a powerful explosion blew away much of the outer walls from a five-star hotel in the heart of Cuba’s capital, Havana. The explosion is believed to have been caused by a gas leak, according to the Twitter account of the office of President Miguel Díaz-Canel. No tourists were lodged at the 96-room Hotel Saratoga because it was undergoing renovations, Havana Gov. Reinaldo García Zapata said, according to the report. -Advertisement- Search and rescue efforts are underway for people possible trapped under the rubble, according to AP. Local media said officials reported 13 people missing and about 30 known injured. A school next door was evacuated and local news media said none of the children had been hurt. Police cordoned off the area as firefighters and ambulance crews worked inside.
