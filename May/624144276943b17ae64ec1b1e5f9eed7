ABUJA – The Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) Godwin Emefiele was on Thursday, spotted at the Presidential Villa Abuja, where he met with President Muhammadu Buhari. Although the meeting was held behind closed doors, Emefiele failed to disclose his mission in the Villa, neither did he make any official statement on his meeting with the President. Upon prodding by State House Correspondents to make some comments, he simply said he has no news for them but there will be news very soon. -Advertisement- He said: “There is no news now, but there will be news”. Probed further on his unannounced visit to the Presidential Villa, the CBN boss retorted: “You heard me, I said there is no news but there will be news”. Reminded that Nigerians and the international community are anxious about his position, Emefiele countered that they should worry themselves for nothing as he is having fun. Let them have heart attack, it’s good to have heart attack. I am having a lot of fun”, the Governor of Nigeria’s apex bank said. Although no official statement has been issued on why the CBN Governor visited the seat of power, it may not be unconnected with his recent involvement in politicking which saw his name being mentioned among the Presidential aspirants in the forthcoming All Progressives Congress (APC) primary election. POLL Also, President Buhari has since asked cabinet ministers who have Presidential ambitions to quit their positions while a circular from the Federal Government has told civil servants including Emefiele who have political ambitions to resign from their posts. It is not clear, what moves Emefiele will make in the coming days, especially as the collection of nominations forms for the All Progressive Congress closed on Thursday, to pave way for screening.
