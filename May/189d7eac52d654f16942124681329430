In the build-up of the All Progressives Congress (APC) presidential primaries, Senator Babafemi Ojudu, Political Adviser to President Muhammadu Buhari in the Office of the Vice President has revealed that Prof. Yemi Osinbajo is optimistic about winning the presidential ticket of the party ahead of the 2023 general elections. Sen. Ogudu made this disclosure on Wednesday after VP Osinbajo met with APC delegates in the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) to canvass their support ahead of the party’s primary election slated for the end of the month. Daily Independent had reported that Osinbajo has so far interfaced with the party’s delegates in 13 states of the federation. -Advertisement- Speaking on the outcome of his consultations across states, Ojodu said the feedback from the state-by-state engagements had been positive. He said, “It’s not for nothing that we choose to go to all the states. It’s not for nothing that we choose to know the minds of all the delegates. It’s not for nothing that the VP wants to shake hands and have a photograph taken with each and every delegate that he comes across. “We can measure it from time to time, and as we’re moving around, scientifically, we’re measuring our chances; and we’re getting good feedback. We’re polling on a daily basis, and at the end of the day, we’ll emerge as the flagbearer of our party and we’ll all smile.”
