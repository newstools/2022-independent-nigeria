Sokoto State Governor, Aminu Tambuwal, has revealed that President Muhammadu Buhari shortchanged the South-East by excluding the people of the South-East from his administration. The 2023 Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) presidential aspirant disclosed this on Friday during his meeting with the party’s delegates in Imo State, expressing that the exclusion of the people of South-East will not be excluded if he becomes the next president. Tambuwal said, “Buhari has shortchanged the South-East. I was the one who advised Saraki to choose Ike Enweremadu to become his deputy in 2015. There is a complete case of exclusion of the people of South East. The head of the ten most important parastatals are not from South-East, including the CBN governor. -Advertisement- “None of the service chiefs is from the South-East. The president, the vice president, the Senate president, the deputy senate president, the speaker of the House of Representatives and his deputy is from the South-East. Under my watch that can’t happen. Every part of this country will be carried along. “South-East and Imo State in particular can’t be excluded. The PDP will win back Imo when I become president. Igbo people are industrial. You will find a partner in me. We are working together with our brothers in Sokoto. We have restored normalcy now in Sokoto State. I will be a president for all Nigerians.”
