Veteran Nollywood actress, Hilda Dokubo, has lamented over the fact that twins and triplets are still being killed in some communities in Nigeria. She disclosed this on Saturday in a post via her Instagram page, expressing her disappointment in multiple birth killings. The actress said, “Please help me understand this… in 2022 some communities are still killing twins and triplets and those who their mother died giving birth. -Advertisement- “Seriously how is it the child’s fault how he/she enters the world? How is it the child’s fault that the mother died giving birth? How is multiple birth evil? “This is so depressing Hopefully when the politicians finish with politics, they will take on the responsibility of governance. It’s a zoned out weekend people.” Recall that Mary Slessor, a Scottish missionary, abolished the killing of twins in Calabar as they were perceived to be evil by Efik people. The Reuters Foundation in a 2018 article reported that up until 1996, this act of infanticide was still being secretly practiced. The report noted that, in fact, some mothers still had to give up their twin babies to children foundations in order to avoid the untimely maiming of their offspring. POLL According to an article published by History of Yesterday, the communities still deny that it exists, there are silent whispers that it still operates.
