In commemoration of this year’s World Earth Day (WED), Unity Bank Plc in partnership with 3 non-government organisations – Recycling Scheme for Women and Youth Empowerment, RESWAYE, MEDIC and KBG – has conducted a beach cleaning exercise as part of its commitments to promoting environmental sustainability. No fewer than 200 members of staff, as well as over 100 members of RESWAYE thronged the venue of the cleaning exercise – the Lagos Kids Beach Garden within the Oba Elegushi beach environs – where they picked and removed over 100,000 plastic bottles from the beach to make the beach safer and reduce ocean pollution. The bank also carried out a tree planting exercise across the country, as the Staff of the bank across the bank’s branches nationwide planted at least one tree. -Advertisement- Mr. Chris Nwambu, the Group Head, Risk Management, Unity Bank Plc, while speaking at the event, said that the World Earth Day initiatives are part of the bank’s corporate social responsibility aimed at leading major collaborative initiatives for climate action. Citing recent reports on ocean pollution, he decried that “of the over 300 million tons of plastic waste ends up in oceans yearly, an estimated 8 million tons of plastic enters our oceans. “There are 5.25 trillion pieces of plastic waste estimated to be in our oceans. While 70 per cent of our debris sinks into the ocean’s ecosystem, 15 per cent floats, and 15 per cent lands on our beaches.” He added that such activity as the collaboration and partnership by organizations would play a vital role in reducing the threats of ocean plastics and thereby reduce the climate risks they pose to the earth. He reiterated that Unity Bank will continue to be very aggressive in terms of environmental protection and sustainability commitments, adding that “in line with the bank’s agribusiness strategic focus over the past couple of years, the bank has granted access to credit to businesses in greenhouse farming and metal recycling to the tune of N3.25 billion”.
