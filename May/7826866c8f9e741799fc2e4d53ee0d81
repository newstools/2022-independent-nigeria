Giorgio Chiellini is leaning towards accepting the only formal offer he has received from MLS, claim reports in Italy, which is from LAFC. The Italy legend left Juventus amid emotional scenes last night, deciding to walk away although he still has a year left to run on his contract. He had extended it to June 2023 in the hope he’d be able to participate in the 2022 World Cup in Qatar, but Italy failed to qualify, therefore also changing his plans. -Advertisement- According to Sportitalia and Gazzetta dello Sport transfer expert Alfredo Pedullà, only one genuine proposal has arrived at Chiellini’s door from Major League Soccer and it is Los Angeles FC. There was interest from Inter Miami and Toronto FC, but LAFC is the only firm contract for 18 months. Chiellini turns 38 in August and dropped his biggest hint yet during an interview with Sky Sport Italia last night pointing towards America. “I honestly don’t know, I need to face an important decision. An experience abroad enriches you just on a cultural level even more than on the field, so I feel the need for an experience and to face a different culture outside of this life at Juventus that I know so well. “I will decide with my family soon.” POLL Another reason to push for LAFC is that his former teammate and great friend Alessandro Del Piero already lives in Los Angeles.
