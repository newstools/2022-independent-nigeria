OWERRI – Indigenes of communities in Arondizuogu in the Ideato North Council Area of Imo State led by their traditional rulers have cried out to the Federal Government over the deplorable condition of the 51km Okigwe / Arondizuogu / Akokwa / Uga / Amichi / Nnewi / Oba road which they alleged not only impedes vehicular movement in their areas but had equally become a den of robbers and kidnap­pers, adding that the road cuts across 100 communities in the Southeast region. According to the aggrieved monarchs, the road, which was constructed in 1982 by the then Shehu Shagari administration has deteriorated to the extent that many communities had been severed from their neigh­bours while transportation of agricultural produce to the ur­ban centres had now become a herculean task. The traditional ruler of Ndiakunwanta Iheme Auton­omous Community, Arondi­zuogu HRH Eze (Dr.) Martin Orizu spoke to the Saturday INDEPENDENT during a peaceful protest organised by the embattled indigenes who incessantly chanted sol­idarity songs with placards bearing such inscriptions as “the suffering is unbearable”, “Our people are dying”, “Stop killing and kidnapping”, “No Election here in 2023 unless FG fixes this road”, “Okigwe Arondizuogu is a kidnappers’ den and “we need urgent help”. -Advertisement- Eze Orizu, who is the Ohazurumee 1 of his commu­nity spoke in tandem with his counterpart of Iheme Izuogu Autonomous Community who is also the Chairman of Aron­dizuogu Council of traditional rulers as well as the chairman of Ideato North Traditional Institution and Community Policing – HRH Eze Kosmann Ndubuisi Kanu. The monarchs, who pro­fusely lamented over the hard­ship and travail of their people arising from the horrible na­ture of the road said, “today, it is impossible for us to use this road unlike before when you simply come out and board a vehicle to Lagos, Abuja and other parts of the country. “Government should come and assist us because for now, we are completely cut off. We were told that a contract for the rehabilitation of the road was awarded but it did not last hence daily armed robbery and kidnapping has become the order of the day.”
