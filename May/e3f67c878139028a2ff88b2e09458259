ABUJA – The leadership of the House of Representatives has postponed its scheduled resumption of plenary for Tuesday, May 24,2022 due to political commitments with party primaries across the country. The House which reconvened a fortnight ago to pass some anti terrorism and money laundering Bills had adjourned sitting to May 24th as resumption date. However, a circular just released by the Clerk of the House, Dr. Yahaya Danzaria Esq, the new resumption date will now be June, 7, 2022. -Advertisement- “I am directed to inform all Hon Members, Staff, Media and the General Public that due to the on-going Party Primaries the House will now resume plenary on Tuesday, 7th June, 2022 at 11:00 am,” the circular reads. Recall that leading political parties in the country last week postponed their primary elections with the main opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), rescheduled it parliamentary, governorship and presidential primaries, just as the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), shifted theirs by several days. While the PDP was able to conduct its state assembly primaries on Sunday May 22nd, the APC couldn’t, shifting it to Wednesday and Thursday for state assembly, national Assembly and governorship contests respectively, while fixing that of presidential to Sunday, May 29th, just a day after the PDP convention slated for Saturday.
