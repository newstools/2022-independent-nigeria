LAGOS  – The Chairman of the Nigerian Institution of Estate Surveyors and Valuers (NIESV), Lagos State Branch, Mrs.Olabisi Demola-Alade has stressed the need for practising estate surveyors and valuers both in the private and public sectors and even in the academia to aspire to become associate members of the institution. She stated this at a Media parley to reel out activities mapped out by the institution to celebrate its 2021/2022 Estate Surveyors and Valuers week. According to her, since the current EXCO came on board in May 2021, she has continued to pursue with vigour, the realisation of her 10-point agenda with a view to bringing to the front burner, the critical role the estate surveyors and valuers play in the built environment. -Advertisement- She noted, that her advocacy drive had taken her to some private organisations including some tertiary institutions like the Yaba College of Technology(Yabatech) to sensitise estate surveyors and valuers of the advantage inherent in becoming associate members. The NIESV Chairman, who scored herself high on the 10-point agenda she set for herself and members of the EXCO, noted with delight, that as she clocks one year in office this month, more associate members especially in ‘The very Branch’ as the Lagos branch is called, have been enrolled. According to her, the 2021/2022 Estate Surveyors and Valuers week is an avenue for members to ‘unwind’ and further ‘network’ with a view to expanding their scope of work and knowledge of the profession. Activities lined up for the week include amongst others,a Summit, visit to Yaba College of Technology,visit to Modupe Cole Home with the climax being a Jumat Service on Friday at Central Mosque at Alausa and a Thanksgiving Church service at the Chapel of Light also at Alausa Ikeja.
