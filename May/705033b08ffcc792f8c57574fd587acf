America-based Nigerian rapper, Jidenna has listed 12 things couples should take into consideration in order to learn if one has found the right person to commit to. According to the singer, he accumulated the knowledge not just based on his experience but also from different traditions including proverbs that he got from Islam. Schooling his Instagram followers, Jidenna urged those ready to make the commitment to travel with their spouse, work with them on a project, let themselves be observed doing something excellent, observe them doing something that they are excellent at and to also meet their friends. “Have them meet your friends. Observe them in a crisis moment. Have them observe you in a crisis moment. Meet their family. Have them meet your family. If you do this kind of thing, observe them while they are inebriated and have them observe you when you are inebriated. And lastly, I say, live with them. And that can be in an Airbnb for an extended period of time or you can actually move in and try it out. But that’s up to you. -Advertisement- “And if you do these 12 things, you find out very quickly that people kind of weed themselves out because, in one of those things, you are going to see some red flags. Some are going to be yellow flags. Hopefully, a lot will be green, but you’ll know by the end of that 12, you’ll probably know sooner, whether or not you should commit to the person,” he noted.
