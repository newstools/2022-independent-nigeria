YENAGOA – Mr. Richard Akinaka, a Ni­ger Delta youth leader and maritime entrepreneur, has joined his voice to calls from several quarters asking the governor of Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Godwin Emefiele, to respect the law establishing the apex bank and resign his appointment. Akinaka, in a statement on Monday, berated Emefiele for refusing to resign his position while seeking to contest the 2023 presidential election on the platform of the All Pro­gressives Congress (APC). He described Emefiele’s behaviour as a violation of ethics and gross misconduct not expected of a public offi­cer occupying the office of the CBN governor. -Advertisement- Akinaka’s reaction came on the heels of reports that three pro-Emefiele groups namely, Rice Farmers Asso­ciation of Nigeria, Friends of Emefiele and Emefiele Support Group had last week paid N100 million for the APC presidential expression of in­terest and nomination forms for Emefiele. Though the CBN governor had denounced the groups, Akinaka said Emefiele’s re­fusal to quit office to pursue his political ambition was an embarrassment to the coun­try while desecrating the law setting up the apex bank. Akinaka pointed out that the country’s poor econo­my and economic hardship suffered by Nigerians were indications of Emefiele’s monumental failure as CBN governor, thus he said he lacked the capacity to be pres­ident. He said: “Section 9 of the CBN Act, 2007 provides that the governor and the deputy governors shall devote the whole of their time to the ser­vice of the bank, and while holding office, shall not en­gage in any full or part-time employment or vocation, whether remunerated or not.”
