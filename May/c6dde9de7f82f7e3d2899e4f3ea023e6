The Peoples Democratic Party House of Representatives Can­didate, Okpe/Sapele/Uvwie Federal Constituency, Rt. Hon. Evelyn Omavowan Oboro Esq., has stated that Children’s Day should be a day to reflect on children’s education, growth, development, welfare, health, and other issues affecting the Nigerian child. Oboro, who made this known yesterday in a statement, called on well-meaning indigenes and stakeholders of Okpe/Sapele/ Uvwie to continue educating and sensitising the public on the Child Rights Act, 2003 as well as working towards the adoption of the relevant laws protecting the children in Urhobo, Delta State and Nigeria. “Children’s Day, 2022 is therefore another opportunity for us to call upon Federal and State governments as the upper guardian of the child, to look into the affairs of our children nationwide,” she said. -Advertisement- “As adults, parents and guardians, it is our duty to en­sure that the children’s rights are protected. We must increase our advocacy and awareness on the importance of respect­ing the rights of children,” she advised. According to Oboro, “the family, which is the first agent of socialisation for children, is wanting in inculcation of cul­tural and social values in them. Many girl-children are victims of incest, rape and other untow­ard behaviour, even from close family members. “We call on parents to incul­cate moral values in their chil­dren. Faith-based organisations should contribute to the moral upbringing of children. Let par­ents also spend valuable time with their children and attend to their problems,” she added.
