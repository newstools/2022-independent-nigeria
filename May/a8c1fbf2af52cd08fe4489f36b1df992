POLL “Therefore, with the novel synergy between the Labour Party and the NCFront, the convening platform of the 3rd Force Movement, which is also today the largest political mass movement in the country, Nigerians can rest assured that the glorious future we all desire for our dear country, is now achievable by 2023, especially with the brewing implosion hovering over the ruling cartel of APC and PDP, which will soon burst into unpreventable disintegration after their party primaries. “However, taking inspiration from the consummation of NCFront/Labour Party novel fusion, Leaders of the ‘3rd Force’ Movement across party lines, including Prof Attahiru Jega of the People’s Redemption Party, PRP, Prof Pat Utomi of the Labour Party and Senator Saidu Dansadau of the National Rescue Movement, NRM, among others have been mandated by the Leadership of the 3rd Force Movement and like-minded allied political Parties to drive a Mega Electoral Alliance of the 3rd Force Movement towards the adoption of a single line of candidates among seven allied Parties involved in the ‘3rd Force’ alliance talks for the 2023 Elections According to the statement, an inclusive Consensus Technical Committee is set up to screen Presidential Candidates and other candidates of ‘3rd Force’ allied Parties towards the adoption of a single line of candidates across all 2023 elections, is expected to be set up next month after the conclusion of all party primaries. Furthermore, the ‘3rd Force’ Mega Electoral Pact for the 2023 elections is proposed around agreement on Labour Charter of Demand, EndSar Youths Demands and Constitutional Referendum for Nigeria, among others to be agreed as terms of the Alliance for the 2023 elections,” the statement added.
