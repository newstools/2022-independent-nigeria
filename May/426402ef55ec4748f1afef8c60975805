An Industrial maize milling company in Jos, Plateau State, Benybite Foods Nigeria Limited, has called for peaceful coexistence among the different ethno-religious groups in the state and beyond to live in peace and harmony as the world is celebrating eid-el-Fitr. The company’s Managing Director, Benjamin Kayode-Ojo, made this call in Jos during the free distribution of their bags of flour to the Fiber NASCO Juma’at Mosque by Old Airport Junction. Speaking before the products left the company’s premises, Ojo said that peace is key for every society to thrive and that they will continue to use their humanitarian outreach to assist the needy during the celebration and festive seasons and to also call and pray for tolerance, understanding among the people good neighbourliness and growth of the society. Represented during the donation of the items at the mosque, the company’s Head of IT and Commercial Innovation, Agboola Taofeek Olayinka, said the donation has become imperative in order to assist those who may not have anything to eat during the Sallah celebration due to economic hardship. He said they have also donated to NAFSAT Mosque opposite the University of Jos Permanent Site, as well as Nadabo Farm Central Mosque in Dass Road, Bauchi State. According to him, they also reach out to the Christian communities during their celebrations. Receiving the items on behalf of the Chief Imam for the less privileged, Ustaaz Omar Farouq, thanked the company for their gesture and urged other bodies and individuals to follow suit. He said those who give to the needy from their heart always have their special reward, and that it is a divine injunction. He prayed for the success of the company so that God will increase them abundantly since they have made humanitarian services one of their core mission.
