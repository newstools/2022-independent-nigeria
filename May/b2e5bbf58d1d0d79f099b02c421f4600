Kadiri Ikhana, the former coach of Super Falcons, has risen in defence of Finidi George, the coach of Eny­imba, saying all that the former Super Eagles wing­er needed was time to fully articulate ideas, visions and tactics on the team. Ikhana, a former CAF Coach of the Year and CAF Champions League win­ning manager with Eny­imba, said the former Ajax Amsterdam of Holland winger is not a bad coach, explaining that with time, his Enyimba side would be up and running. “Let me first say that I have been following Eny­imba since Finidi became their coach. He is not doing badly,” he told our corre­spondent. -Advertisement- “Enyimba has enough material and experience to stand on their own by now; they are still one of the best in Africa. It is just that the players need to be made to understand the club they are playing at. “What we don’t know is that the playing mentality of Europe and Africa are not the same; Finidi needs to fully understand the ter­rain here and the psycholo­gy of the players regarding the league where they are playing. “Give the coach the next one year and I can tell you that he would fully align his tactics with the play­ers’ mentality; he would fully impose his own ideas on the team and they will start getting it right. “I think they are not do­ing badly, just that we ex­pect them to be among the front runners but they can still improve with the sea­son yet to end,” the former Super Eagles defender said. Ikhana led Enyimba to the 2003 CAF Champions League glory after they overcame Ismaily of Egypt, a feat the seven times Nige­rian champions repeated the following season
