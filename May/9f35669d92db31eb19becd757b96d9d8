Harry Maguire could return from injury before the end of Manchester United’s season, interim manager Ralf Rangnick has revealed. United played their final home game of the season on Monday night, beating Brentford 3-0. They play Brighton on May 7, before a break of almost two weeks until they travel to Crystal Palace. -Advertisement- Maguire has not played since United’s 4-0 defeat to Liverpool on April 19, having suffered from a knee problem. Rangnick said: “Harry Maguire might be available again. We have to wait and see if he can train the day after tomorrow (Wednesday).” However, Rangnick confirmed that teammate Jadon Sancho would be struggling to feature in either of United’s remaining matches, and that the winger had spent the night in hospital after suffering from tonsillitis. “If (Sancho manages to return) then maybe in the last game,” said Rangnick. “I was in contact with him this afternoon. He was in hospital until this morning so he only returned back home today. He still doesn’t feel well so, for sure, not (for Brighton).” United are sixth in the Premier League, five points behind Arsenal in fourth, having played two more games than Mikel Arteta’s side
