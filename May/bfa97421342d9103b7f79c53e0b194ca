British Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Wednesday defended his plan to relocate illegal immigrants to Rwanda amid legal challenges to the policy, saying it’s “humane, compassionate, and sensible.” The prime minister said he knew “liberal lawyers” would try to “make this difficult,” before promising “we will get it done.” Under the new £120 million deal with the east African country, some of the people who enter the UK illegally are to be “relocated to Rwanda to resettle and rebuild their lives,” Home Secretary Priti Patel on April 14 when she unveiled the deal. -Advertisement- Johnson’s policy director Andrew Griffith previously said it was hoped the scheme would be operational in “weeks, or a small number of months,” but Downing Street on Tuesday confirmed that there had been some legal challenges. Speaking in Southampton on Wednesday, Johnson said the Rwanda deal is “a great deal.”
