Six Spanish tennis players have been given lengthy bans after they were con­victed of criminal charges relating to match-fixing. The players were convict­ed in Spain as part of an on­going case involving organ­ised crime. All six pleaded guilty and were given two-year suspend­ed prison sentences. -Advertisement- The International Tennis Integrity Agency (ITIA) said it was “one of the most signif­icant infiltrations of tennis by organised crime that we have seen”. The bans from tennis range from seven to 22 years. Marc Fornell-Mestres, Jorge Marse-Vidri, Carlos Ortega, Jaime Ortega, Mar­cos Torralbo and Pedro Ber­nabe Franco were each fined 450 Euros by the court. The ITIA also enforced its own financial punishments, with Fornell-Mestres fined 250,000 euros of which 200,000 euros was suspended, and Marse-Vidri fined 15,000 Euros with 5,000 euros suspended. The remaining players received total fines of 450,000 Euros of which 390,000 Euros was suspended. POLL They cannot play in or at­tend any event organised by an international or national association, or coach in the professional game. Fornell-Mestres’ highest world ranking was 236 in 2007 and he has won two Associa­tion of Tennis Professionals (ATP) Challenger Tour titles, while Marse-Vidri reached 562 in 2008. The four other players were all unranked. “This ruling sends a strong message that match-fixing is a crime which can see crim­inal convictions,” ITIA chief executive Jonny Gray said. “We welcome the involve­ment of law enforcement agencies and the prosecution of entire criminal networks, not just the players involved.”
