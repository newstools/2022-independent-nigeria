I won by 72 votes to Olafemi’s 70 votes” he said. POLL In a statement, the Folorunsho Olafemi Campaign Organisation urged Governor Yahaya Bello and the APC leadership to call Fanwo to order. “It has come to our attention that Hon. Kingsley Fanwo, an aspirant at the just concluded primary election of the APC for the Yagba Federal Constituency of House of Representatives, having scored the total votes of 72, is parading himself on various social platforms as the winner”. “It is unequivocally clear that Engr. Folorunsho Olafemi is the winner of the just concluded primaries with the total vote of 76 as against that of the above-stated aspirant”. “We, therefore, call on the leadership of the party at all levels, especially His Excellency, Governor Yahaya Bello and other stakeholders to ensure the protection and preservation of the mandate willingly given to Engr. Folorunsho Olafemi by the people in the interest and spirit of fairness, justice and equity”. “It is important at this time to preserve the victory of Engr. Folorunsho Olafemi, as tension is being heightened as a result of the fake news  being circulated by the supporters of Hon Fanwo. This is to avoid breakdown of law and order in the Constituency”. “This election has been won and lost without an iota of ambiguity, we therefore call on other aspirants to join hands with Engr. Folorunsho Olafemi to build the Yagba of our dreams, as against self declaration and peddling of fake results which has no place in law”.
