A group under the auspices of Youth Group from Lafia/Obi Federal Constituency, on Sunday, called on APC delegates to vote for Hauawa Ibrahim a 36-years-old female aspirant who joined the race to unseat Abubakar Sarki Dahiru who is representing the constituency at the green chamber Yarwa Ahmad, the Chairman of the group, made the call during a press conference in Lafia, the state capital. The group said the endorsement of a 36 years old female aspirant was to encourage women’s participation in politics for gender balance in governance. -Advertisement- Hauwa Ibrahim recently joined the race to represent the Lafia/Obi Federal Constituency at the House of Representatives, under the platform of the All Progressives Congress. Ahmed noted that since 1999, the constituency has never had a female representative at the National Assembly which was why they were supporting the aspirant to emerge victorious given her experience and antecedents in the public and private sectors. He said, “Over the year, we have lacked women’s participation in politics. We know that women are good managers as we can see in our homes and if they are given an opportunity to serve in governance, Nasarawa state and indeed entire Nigeria will be a better place for all of us. “Women’s participation in politics will also create a gender balance in governance because we are aware that men have taken over the politics of Nasarawa state. ” This is why we the youth of Lafia/Obi Federal Constituency have gathered to show our support to Hon. Hauwa Nana Ibrahim for her ambition to represent us at the House of Representatives in 2023,” the group called.
