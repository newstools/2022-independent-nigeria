ABUJA – The Tertiary Education Trust Fund(TETFund) has cautioned Nigerians to disregard a fake Approvals- in-Principle currently in circulation, allegedly being used to defraud the unsuspecting public. Abdulmumin Oniyangi, Ag. Director, Public Affairs of TETFund, raised the alarm on Wednesday, in Abuja, clarifying that some of the institutions that the AIPs are being sent to were not statutory beneficiaries of the Fund. The statement refuting the fraudulent act reads, “the attention of the Management of Tertiary Education Trust Fund (TETFund) has been drawn to some fake Approvals-in-Principle (AIP) quoting outrageous sums as allocations to some institutions that are not even beneficiaries of theFund. So far, this has been mainly concentrated in and around Jos, Plateau State. -Advertisement- “The fraudulent methods currently being adopted by these unknownindividuals or groups include the issuance of Approval-in-Principle tounsuspecting institutions using the letterhead of the Fund and handing same to members of the public in exchange for gratification. “The Fund wishes to inform the public that A.I.P is not tantamount to the award ofcontracts and does not confer financial benefits to third parties. Its issuance isbased on allocations of funds specifically to beneficiaries of TETFund which in this case are the Public Universities, Polytechnics and Colleges of Education as expressly stated by the laws establishing TETFund. “The Management, therefore, dissociates itself from the activities of these individuals or groups and advises stakeholders and the public to be wary of the activities of these fraudsters who come under the guise of consultants to TETFund to defraud unsuspecting Nigerians. All communication from TETFund shall be direct to beneficiary institutions and through open transparent channels”.
