LAGOS – Ace music video director & cinematographer, TG Omori has explained why he is not a sucker for religion like most people. The talented visuals craftsman who has worked with the likes of Olamide, Wizkid, Burna Boy, Tekno, Kiss Daniel, Fireboy DML, Falz, Timaya, Naira Marley, among many others, made the revelation while reacting to the gruesome murder of Deborah Samuel, a 200L student of Shehu Shagari College Of Education, Sokoto, for allegedly blaspheming against Prophet Mohammed. He wrote, “Knowing how people put the love for religion over love for humanity is the more reason I hate religion. Can’t y’all wake up, can’t you see, this priest are humans like you, the prophets from time past were once humans like you, there is only one God and he dwells inside of you! You is the true religion.” -Advertisement- “Life is so much mystery, I totally understand that most of us don’t even know what’s next, if we die today where we going to, where do we even come from? The conflict in religious stories about humans existence is enough reason for you to know that no one really have the answers.” “The deeper you go into religion the farther You go away the truth.” See tweet thread below; POLL
