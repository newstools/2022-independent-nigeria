Nigerian comic skit maker and activist, Debo Adedayo, popularly known as Mr Macaroni, has stated he will never support or join the ruling All Progressive Congress (APC) or the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). The comedian disclosed this on Monday via his official Twitter page, stating that he will rather join another party to effect change in the country. He wrote, “Everyone has the right to support any party they wish to. I will never support PDP or APC!! Insult me all you like, that is my choice. I will join another party and hope that the party can one day also become a force!! For things to change, the foundation must be right!! -Advertisement- “This has always been my stand and I have said it here severally.If we want things to change, we can’t continue recycling. If everyone is tired, let us in our numbers identify with another party and take back the country from those that have been ruling for donkey years. “Pay no attention to those who ridicule the idea of another party. It is definitely not going to be easy. And the change in power won’t happen once. But we must begin from somewhere. If the people are United, the people are unstoppable!”
