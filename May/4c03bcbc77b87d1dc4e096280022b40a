NNEWI – Hon. Nnamdi Unobuagha, the first elected executive chairman of the famous Onitsha Main Market, has applauded Governor Charles Chukwuma Soludo on the re­cent dissolution and setting up of new caretaker exec­utives to run some markets in the state, noting that the action was the best remedy to move administration of markets forward. Unobuagha added that the action was a good riddance to bad rubbish that had ren­dered the development of the state market backward. This is just as he opined that the move would now restore san­ity that would in turn usher in rapid transformation of markets in the state. Giving the commendation while speaking with news­men on the matter during a public function in Nkpor Ide­mili Council Area on Monday, Unobuagha expressed sad­ness over alleged reports on how some of the sacked care­taker executives had turned most markets in the state to avenues to enrich their pock­ets instead of government by indulging in illegal construc­tion of shops, collection of revenues, as well as engaging in all manners of unethical practices to defraud the state government.
