Nahuel Molina is destined for a move to a top club this summer and Arsenal currently lead Juventus and Atletico Madrid in the race to secure his signature. The 24-year-old Argentinian right back has had a great season with Udinese, scoring seven goals and providing four assists in 34 league appearances, and it’s clear that he’s ready to make the jump to a top side, taking the next step in his career following last year’s Copa America victory. As reported by Calciomercato.com, Arsenal have recently expressed concrete interest in Molina and they have a plan to secure the right back; Pablo Mari is currently on loan with Udinese and they could look to include the Spaniard in a possible deal. -Advertisement- Juventus and Atletico Madrid are also keen, although the former were not impressed by the €30m price tag. Diego Simeone’s side will decide whether or not they want to make a move for the 24-year-old in a few weeks, after the end of the season.
