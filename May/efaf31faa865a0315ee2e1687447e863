Bauchi State Governor and one of the leading People’s Democratic Party (PDP) Presidential aspirants, Bala Mohammed has expressed his preparedness to accept party supremacy and decisions over who should fly the party’s flag in the 2023 general elections. Governor Mohammed who spoke to journalists shortly after addressing Niger State delegates at the party’s secretariat along the eastern by-pass in Minna said he is well aware that the decision of the PDP is supreme on who should be the flag bearer in the build-up to the general elections. The PDP decision is supreme and it must be obeyed, Bala Mohammed said, notwithstanding he is presenting himself before party elders, members and Nigerians to hear what he has to offer towards restoring Nigeria to the path of glory before deciding on who to lead them. Governor Mohammed told hundreds of PDP supporters in Minna, “I am a democrat and it is not a do or die affair, I am just presenting myself for the party whose leaders have the discretion to choose whoever they want”. The talked about the zoning of the Presidency which according to him said is not a problem to him if that is agreed by the PDP as a formula aimed at bringing dissolution of powers between the federating units to ensure equity, justice and fairness is commendable. While encouraging delegates to judge aspirants by track records and not by claims the Governor said, “I am a general in politics and nothing is wrong in having a plan B and C because I always have plans not only for myself but for my followers, campaign directors and others as well”. Against the clamour to jettison zoning in some quarters, Governor Mohammed explained that zoning is in the PDP constitution deliberately aimed at ensuring peace, equity and justice for the diverse regions and ethnic nationalities hence it must be abided by members who believe in party supremacy.
