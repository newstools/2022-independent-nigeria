A Palestinian teenager was shot by Israeli troops Friday near the town of Bethlehem in the occupied West Bank and died of his wounds, the Palestinian health ministry said. Zayd Mohammed Ghouneim, 15, was shot in the back and neck and died in hospital, a ministry statement said. The Israeli army told AFP that it fired at “suspects” who “hurled rocks and Molotov cocktails” at its soldiers during a patrol in the Al-Khader district south of Bethlehem. -Advertisement- The soldiers’ live fire hit one “suspect”, the army said. Israeli forces have frequently conducted raids in the occupied West Bank since a wave of attacks inside Israel and on West Bank settlers from late March. The raids are focused on the district of Jenin, where many of the attackers come from. Dozens of suspected militants but also non-combatants – including Shireen Abu Akleh, a journalist who was covering a raid in Jenin – have been killed in the West Bank raids.
