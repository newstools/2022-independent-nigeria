The branch Chairman of Kebbi State National Association of Nigerian Nurses and Midwives (NANNM), Comrade Abdulwaliyu Kelani has called on the state government to employ more nurses in the state to attain easy and accessible healthcare delivery. Kelani who spoke exclusively to our correspondent said that, though nurses are in short supply globally, the need to add to the numbers is inevitable as public hospitals are expected to have at least a hundred nurses per health facility existing in the state. He added that the state government is doing much in nurses training in universities and other equivalent tertiary institutions in the country as the state can now boost graduate nurses in different fields saying at least 20 nurses from Kebbi state are undergoing a master’s degree in nursing. -Advertisement- While lending his voice on the approved four months of maternity leave for lactating mothers he decried non-implementation in Kebbi state, particularly nurses whom he said should have stayed back to nurse their babies till they become easy to care for to enable them to pay attention to patients but they now only enjoy the mundane type of 3 months. On pay rise for nurses he said they need a hundred per cent implementation to close the gap of the remaining percentage, he also appeals to the government to expedite action on the approval given on community nursing as the knowledge if acquired can reduce the pressure being experienced from the primary healthcare facilities across the state. At the association level, he said NANNM will henceforth provide financial assistance to nurses studying for master’s degrees to encourage them and others to go to school.
