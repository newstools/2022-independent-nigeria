Mohamed Salah has confirmed he will stay at Liverpool next season but Sadio Mane has refused to reveal what his future holds until after the Champions League final. Salah is out of contract at the end of next season and is yet to agree new terms, with Liverpool currently unwilling to match the Egyptian’s demands. There had been reports that the forward could depart this summer in search of a new challenge with Liverpool willing to cash in rather than lose him on a free next year. -Advertisement- However, Salah has now quashed those fears by confirming that he will remain at Liverpool next season, regardless of whether he signs a new contract this summer. Speaking ahead of the Champions League final against Real Madrid, the Premier League Golden Boot winner said: “I don’t focus on my contract at the moment, I don’t want to be selfish at all. “This is about the team now; this is a really important week for us, and I’m just focused on the team. “I want to win the Champions League again; I want to see Hendo [Jordan Henderson] have it again in his hands and give it to me after. I don’t want to talk about the contract, we have a long time – I am stay next season, for sure.”
