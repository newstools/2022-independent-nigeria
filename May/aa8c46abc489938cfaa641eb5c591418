Hon. Evang Paul Etaga, former Chairman of Ughelli South Local Government Area, from Ewu political bloc, is the most outstanding aspirant for the Ughelli South Constituency race into the Delta House of Assembly. Dependable stakeholders and well informed audience in the Ughelli South Political space have concurred that Hon. Paul Etaga is a man with a divine mandate because all the circumstances both su­pernatural , natural and even the political equation favour his candidacy. The way and manner the Po­litical followership of Hon Paul Etaga is growing geometrically in lips and bound suggest only one thing that indeed the finger of God is upon him in the au­dacious ambition to the Delta State House of Assembly come 2023. -Advertisement- Hon Etaga is clearly more disposed to give a robust and purposeful representation to the good people of Ughelli South as a dogged grassroots and distinguished politician if given the mandate to serve. The argument has been cleared time and time again that the political tripod of Ughelli South is made up of Ughievw­en, Olomu and Ewu on which the political power resolves. The three blocs share the available major political posi­tions on rotational basis in the spirit of equity, justice and fair­ness for peace and tranquility to reign. The power calculus shows clearly that it is the turn of Ewu bloc to produce the candidate to represent Ughelli South Constit­uency because Hon. Reuben Rume Yakubu lzeze who is currently representing Ughelli South Constituency is from Ughievwen, while the Council Chairman, Dr. Richard Kofi is from Olomu doing his second tenure.
