Towards finding a lasting solution to the crisis in the South-Eastern part of the country, Prof Chukwuma Charles Soludo, the governor of Anambra State paid a visit to Mazi Nnamdi Kanu in his detention at Abuja. Governor Soludo relates the outcome of the visit as follows: -Advertisement- “I visited Mazi Nnamdi Kanu, yesterday, (Friday, 13th May, 2022) to felicitate with him and also as part of the wider consultations with critical stakeholders in search of lasting peace and security in the South East. “He was in very high spirits and we had quality and frank discussion in a very convivial atmosphere. He expressed sadness over what he described as “sacrilegious killings” of innocent persons, kidnappings and all forms of criminality, including the brutal enforcement of the senseless ‘sit-at-home’ being perpetuated by sundry groups claiming to be acting for or on behalf of IPOB”. The governor assured that if the opportunity arises, he will be glad to personally broadcast to Kanu’s followers to maintain the peace. “Together, we shall restore peace, security and prosperity in Anambra and the Southeast.”; Soludo enthused.
