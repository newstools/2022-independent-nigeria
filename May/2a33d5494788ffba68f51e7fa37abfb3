LAGOS  – The Lagos State Government, through the Lagos State Building Control Agency ( LASBCA),has pulled down the remains of a 3- floor structure that partially collapsed along Chris Ngadi Avenue, Ago Palace Way, Okota early Saturday morning. Dr. Idris Salako, the Commissioner for Physical Planning and Urban Development, stated that detailed investigation into the remote and immediate causes of the collapse had been ordered. However, cursory report of the collapse suggested that a section of the building gave way due to over density. -Advertisement- The Commissioner said that no lives were lost despite the fact that the building was in use, adding that the site had been cordoned off to guarantee safety. Salako added that to avert danger another structure under construction on the same street was completely pulled down by LASBCA for poor construction and use of inferior materials. He averred that all hands must be on deck to tackle the menace of building collapse as the recurring events, especially during the rainy season were quite worrisome and requiring holistic measures from all and sundry. He disclosed that the State Government was instituting a lot of far reaching measures to reform the regulatory environment. The measures include the application of stage- detection technology, automation of the activities of the Physical Planning Ministry and its agencies and the creation of more district offices to have more presence in remote parts of the states and be able to detect illegal and distressed buildings.
