GOMBE  – A political pressure group in Gombe State, Hamza Al­mustapha Media Awareness (HALMA), has described the clamour for devolution of power to Southern Nigeria as a non-issue for now. According to the group, ca­pability and capacity should be the watchword for Nigerians in choosing their next presi­dent in 2023. Speaking during the group’s awareness campaign in Gombe over the weekend, Gombe State chairman of the group, Mohammed Habib, said the group was clamouring for a better candidate that could deliver irrespective of zone, region, state, tribe or religion. -Advertisement- He said: “The issue of zon­ing is not what we want now; all we want now is somebody who is capable and has the capacity to lead Nigeria irre­spective of zone, region, state, tribe, religion or whatever background. “We are clamouring for a better candidate that can de­liver and we believe former chief security officer to late Head of State, General Sani Abacha; that is, Major Ham­za Al Mustapha is that person that can deliver.” He said Al Mustapha can take the country out of its current socioeconomic chal­lenges especially in the area of security and economy.
