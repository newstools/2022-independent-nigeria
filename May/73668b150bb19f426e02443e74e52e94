Prof. Itse Sagay (SAN), Chairman of the Presidential Advisory Committee Against Corruption (PACAC) has said that President Muhammadu Buhari should sack the Central Bank Nigeria (CBN) Governor, Godwin Emeifele, for his involvement in partisan politics while still in office as head of the apex bank. Sagay in an interview with DAILY INDEPENDENT said that Emefiele’s desire to contest the 2023 presidency despite his position as CBN governor is abominable and totally unacceptable. He however allayed the fears of some Nigerians that sensitive election materials kept in the custody of the CBN by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) will be tampered with. -Advertisement- “I think his position is abominable and totally unacceptable. He has to resign. In fact, I think he should be sacked by the president. But I don’t agree that his attitude will affect the security of election materials”. “That he wanted to contest or not cannot affect election materials at all because the system of voting we have now only allows a voter through if he/she has a voters card and the machine has to capture your fingerprints and your face. So, there is nothing Emefiele can do with the election materials which can affect the election”. “You have to go through the biometric process when you want to vote. So, I don’t see any reason why people should be worried about election materials kept in CBN custody” Sagay said.
