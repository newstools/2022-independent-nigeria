Chelsea star Mason Mount has proclaimed his excitement for the new era at the club as Todd Boehly prepares to officially take over from Roman Abramovich. The Russian oligarch put the club up for sale three months ago, sparking a bidding war which will come to an end on Monday when the deal is completed to sell the Blues to a consortium led by American investor Boehly for £4.25billion. A hefty £200million worth of investment is set to be put into the team this summer after a long period of stasis in the market for Chelsea, but Mount is optimistic that the future is bright at Stamford Bridge. -Advertisement- “We were obviously in and around [the title race] until about midway through,” he told Sky Sports F1 while taking in the Monaco Grand Prix qualifying alongside Tottenham defender Eric Dier. “Disappointing that we fell off a bit but that’s obviously the goal for next season, we want to close that gap. We want to be up there. “It’s an exciting time now with the owners being confirmed today, going forward it’s going to be exciting and obviously the era under Roman has been brilliant. We look forward now and it’s exciting stuff, can’t wait to get back to it.” On Saturday, Abramovich released a statement to bid farewell to Chelsea. He wrote: “I am pleased this search has now come to a successful conclusion. As I hand over Chelsea to its new custodians, I would like to wish them the best of success, both on and off the pitch. It has been an honour of a lifetime to be a part of this club.”
