Oba Adeyeye Enitan Ogun­wusi, the Ooni of Ife, has commended the courage and the political energy which Olufemi Ajadi, a young pres­idential aspirant, had thus far brought to his quest, urging him to remain politically persistent, as the only way to prove his mettle at the polls. Oba Ogunwusi gave the advice when Ajadi, an aspi­rant on the platform of the New Nigeria People’s Party (NNPP) and his entourage, visited the Oba in his palace to seek royal blessings and guidance in his quest. The Ooni, while welcom­ing the entourage, enjoined the politician to remain fo­cused on the race, wishing him success, long life and prosperity. -Advertisement- “I wish you well; I pray that your political ambition will come to pass with long life and prosperity. I pray that all obstacles from outside and within will not overcome you,” he prayed. Speaking earlier, Ajadi had told the Ooni of his roots as an indigenous person from Ibadan, Oyo State, who how­ever resides and practices pol­itics in Obafemi Owode Local Government of Ogun State.
