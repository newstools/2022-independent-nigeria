The founder of Salvation Ministry, Pastor David Ibiyeomie, has revealed that it is impossible to play and win politics in Nigeria without involving in fetish acts. The cleric disclosed this on Sunday while preaching in a church service, alleging that politicians in the country perform certain scarifies like killing humans in order to win during elections. Ibiyeomie said, “Can you play politics and win in today’s Nigeria, I don’t know of other countries though, but can you win politics with a clear eye? Even if you are the best candidate, you can’t win. -Advertisement- “You can have all the good English, it’s only you and your wife that will vote. “The kind of people who are into politics, some of them pound children, some do sacrifices, some do all manner of things. You need supernatural force to subdue those forces”.
