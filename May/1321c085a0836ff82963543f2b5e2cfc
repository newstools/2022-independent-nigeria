Former Ogun State Health Commissioner, Babatunde Ipaye, has said that his decision to pitch his tent with Gov. Dapo Abiodun was informed by the giant strides being recorded by the governor, especially in the area of project delivery across the state. Speaking in a telephone chat with our correspondent Thursday, Ipaye, who served as commissioner of Health under Ibikunle Amosun, said it was difficult for him not to join the supporters of the governor considering his impressive trajectory which is visible in the three senato­rial districts of the state. Ipaye said though there had been disagreement in the past between his camp and that of Abiodun, it be­came necessary to sink the differences and encourage him to keep up the good job of developing the state, stress­ing, ‘’as an advocate of good governance, I put the interest of the people above personal issues. Even if I or any other person had felt offended by Prince Dapo Abiodun in the past, it is good to put the dif­ferences behind us and sup­port the good job he is doing. ‘’
