Actor, singer and speaker, Lami Phillips-Gbadamosi has listed some of the lessons she learned from her departed colleague and friend, Sound Sultan. Posting a photo of the late singer on Instagram, Lami noted that the always smiling Sultan will be back soon. On the lessons she learnt from him during his lifetime, she said that the Jagbajantis crooner taught her that it is better to listen and learn than to speak and offend, to smile always as her heart will take note and find joy from it “Forgive quickly. If you don’t, you’re the one who suffers. The truth is that bitterness cannot live comfortably in light. Express yourself authentically. It’s ok if nobody understands or validates it.. be yourself. Even when the world gets ugly, stay kind. Don’t let anyone change you. There’s always something to laugh about. You just need to have a childlike heart. -Advertisement- “There’s a lot people don’t see or acknowledge that you do. It’s ok. keep doing it and glorify God. They may never say thank you, they may even spit in your face.. but you stay focused on purpose. Let God lead. God leading you won’t always align with popular opinion. That’s ok. Let God lead,” she wrote. She further noted that she misses having him as a safe place. Earlier in the week, Nigerian superstar, Innocent 2Baba Idibia, paid a visit to the resting place of Sound SUltan, his bosom friend. Sound Sultan was buried in the United States of America. He wrote on Instagram; “Went to pay my respect to my brother SOUND SULTAN. With my brothers @emmaugolee @ amfrankiej @blackahrank. July 11 WORLD SULTAN DAY Blessed #GRATEFUL #WARRIOR.” The singer passed away on Sunday, July 11, 2021, at the age of 44 following a battle with Angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma, a rare form of non-Hodgkin lymphoma, which is a group of related cancers that affect the lymphatic system.
