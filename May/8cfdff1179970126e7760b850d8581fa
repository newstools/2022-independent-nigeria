AKURE – The All Progressives Congress (APC)-led government has been accused of dividing the nation beyond imagina­tion within the period it as­sumed office. Former Vice President Atiku Abubakar stated this in Akure on Sunday night at the Peoples Democratic Par­ty (PDP) secretariat when he came to canvass for the sup­port of the delegates ahead of the party’s national con­vention. Atiku declared that if he emerged president in the gen­eral elections, he would first work on the psyche of the people across all the six geo­political zones to give them a sense of belonging. -Advertisement- He noted that unless the issue of disunity caused by the President Muhammadu Buhari-led government was first addressed, it would be an effort in futility to attempt solving the multi-faced chal­lenges created by the APC government. He said: “My number one priority is to unify the people of this country; how do I uni­fy the people of this country? I will be fair to every part of this country, I will give a sense of belonging to every part of this country, and every part of this country will feel they are part of this country. “It is that unity that will enable us again to live as one nation, one people under God. “Every part of this country is dealing with one aspect of insecurity or the other. I will be very tough on law and or­der. ”I will increase the number of policemen in this country, I will equip them. I will also increase the number of the armed forces; equip them very well, just like we did from 1999 to 2015. POLL “It is only when you secure the country that there will be peace; there is law and order. Then you can deal with eco­nomic challenges.”
