 The Edo State Chapters of the Fitters Senior Staff Association of Nigeria (FISSAN) and the Nigeria Welders Association (NWA) have said the Ossiomo Gas Plant in Ologbo, Ikpoba-Okha Local Government Area of the state, is not owned by Nigeria Gas Marketing Company Limited (NGMC), a subsidiary of the Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNPC). Speaking to journalists in Benin City, the associations who are fabricators of the gas plant said the project is the brainchild of the Managing Director of Ossiomo Power Company, Dr Uwa Igiehon. -Advertisement- Chairman of Edo NISSAN, Comrade Uyi Harrison said the union and their welder’s counterparts were responsible for the fabrication, building and construction of the gas conversion plant under the invitation of Dr Igiehon. He said, “We did the welding, fabrication and installation of the Ossiomo Gas Conversion Plant. Dr Uwa was the person who invited the two unions to join in the building of the gas plant. “Recently, also, he invited the two unions to fabricate another four-inch pipeline which was done and he is the one who pays us and the person we know as the owner, not NGMC.” “The materials we used in the fabrication, building and construction of the gas plant were brought from Warri in Delta State, as well as Lagos and Port-Harcourt in Rivers State,” he added. On his part, Chairman Edo NWA, Comr. Enoma Osaro said when Dr Uwa wanted to employ their services, was not sure about our competencies and professionalism, adding, “When he interacted with the unions, he was satisfied and gave us the job.” POLL He said, “We know Dr Uwa as the owner of the plant. We don’t know any other person but him. He engaged us throughout the process of the fabrication and construction of the gas plant.”
