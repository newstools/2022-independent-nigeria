Juventus have been tipped to rip up Aaron Ramsey’s contract this summer after Rangers declined to pursue a permanent deal for the Welsh midfielder. The 31-year-old joined Rangers in January on a loan deal which did not include an option to buy, but the Scottish side would be given priority this summer when it came to discussing a permanent move for Ramsey. Rangers have since declined to pursue Ramsey again, having seen him make just five league appearances in the second half of the season – just three of which came as a starter – while he started just once in the Europa League and came off the bench to miss the decisive penalty in the final defeat to Eintracht Frankfurt. -Advertisement- As a result, Ramsey is now set to return to Juventus, where he still has 12 months remaining on his contract, but Tuttosport state that the Serie A giants want no part of that. There were reports that Juventus tried to terminate Ramsey’s contract before he moved to Rangers, and now the belief is that the Bianconeri will open talks with the Welshman once again over a possible pay-off. Ramsey is one of Juve’s top earners, having penned a mammoth contract following his free transfer from Arsenal in 2019, but injuries and underwhelming form have restricted him to just 25 starts in Serie A. He made just three outings last season, with his only start coming on the opening day of the campaign, before fitness issues sidelined him in October and delayed his debut for Rangers. Juventus allowed Rodrigo Bentancur to leave for Tottenham in January after they struck a deal to sign Denis Zakaria, and alongside Ramsey, they have been tipped to offload Adrien Rabiot as well.
