Similarly, a female resident, who refused to state her name, said she does not believe the explosion was caused by a gas explosion. “How can they say is a gas explosion, it’s not, she said, how can a gas explosion dismember a human and take him to metres far away,” she said. “It’s a suicide bomber who struggle to enter the school before the explosive got detonated, this is purely a bombing explosion, not gas,” she added. She said some windows of the school and neighbouring houses were shattered.
