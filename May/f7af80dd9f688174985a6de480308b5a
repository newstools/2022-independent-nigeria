Brentford players Ivan Toney and Rico Henry say their families were racially abused at Everton on Sunday. Toney and Henry helped Brentford secure a 3-2 win against nine-man Everton at Goodison Park as the Bees continued their fine form under Thomas Frank. Toney was involved in the key moment of the game when Everton defender Jarrad Branthwaite was shown a straight for card for bringing him down when clean through, and Henry scored a second-half winner. -Advertisement- It was a sweet result for Brentford after fireworks were set off outside their hotel in Liverpool in the early hours of Sunday morning. After the game, Toney tweeted: “Lovely display from the boys but not as good as the fireworks late last night. “Normally I’m being woke up by my son but fireworks was a new one. Big three points! Fans right behind us. Onto next week. “And for the man that racially abused my family Il do everything I can to get you the punishment you deserve!” Henry tweeted: “I never usually speak out on things that don’t physically harm me or my family but to see my mom upset after being racially abused by a few Everton fans brought fire to my stomach!” POLL Brentford twice came from behind to claim all three points against Everton to move up to 11th in the Premier League. The Bees host relegation-threatened Leeds on the final day of the season knowing a win could seal a top-half finish if Brighton fail to beat West Ham.
