MAKURDI – Gubernatorial as­pirant on the plat­form of the All Pro­gressives Congress (APC) in Benue State party primaries, Rev Fr. Hyacinth Alia has described his sus­pension as a normal practice by the Church. Alia also noted that the sacrifice of his suspension was a worthy cause because his mission is to save the soul of the people as well as the state and deliver it from imminent collapse. The aspirant was reacting to the suspension handed down to him by the Bishop of the Catholic Diocese of Gboko, William Avenya who suspended Alia from the exer­cise of sacred ministry, due to his involvement in partisan politics. -Advertisement- The letter of suspension stated interalia, “Therefore, to respond to the spiritual and pastoral needs of the Church in the Catholic Diocese, Gboko, I (Bishop Avenya) have suspended him (Alia) from the exercise of sacred ministry and lasts until he ceases from contumacy.” However, in a statement signed by Kula Tersoo, Head, Media and Publicity, Alia 2023 Gubernatorial organization and made available to Daily Independent in Makurdi on Sunday, Alia appealed to APC members, stakeholders and leaders of the APC in the state to remain steadfast. He said, “The suspen­sion order pronounced by His Lordship, the Bishop of Gboko Catholic Diocese, William Avenya, is a normal practice of the church. He has implicitly officially freed me to go on fully with my strides to rescue Benue from total collapse. “Recall that (a former Gov­ernor of the state) Rev. Fr. Mo­ses Orshio Adasu of blessed memory went through the same process. His footprints are visible for all to see. “As stated clearly in the letter of suspension, I’m only suspended from cele­brating public Eucharistic Masses, but remain a Priest of the Catholic Church for­ever.”
