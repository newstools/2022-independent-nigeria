In line with her mission to signifi­cantly improve the fortunes of the girl child and women in the Warri Kingdom and its environs, Olori Atuwatse III has pledged to fund the education of 100 girls from the Nana Girls College, Warri, Delta State. The endowment was made during a courtesy visit by the stu­dents and staff of school to the Queen’s palace on Wednesday, to appreciate her majesty’s contribu­tion to the empowerment of the girl child in the state. The endowment programme is a part of the Wuwu Ore Initiative, the Olori’s charity project geared to­wards mass empowerment, medical outreaches, and providing oppor­tunities for children, especially the girl-child, to gain quality education and compete favourably with their male counterparts at all levels. -Advertisement- In her address to the delegation, Olori Atuwatse II, appreciated the school delegation for their token of love in her honour and the inno­vative projects from the school and beautifully handcrafted items, all made by the children. The Queen further acknowl­edged the level of intelligence and decorum the pupils displayed. She commended the efforts of their teachers and encouraged the girls to follow their passion with deter­mination. ‘‘I am delighted at the quality of these items exhibited here today. You all are doing your parents and society proud. Do not forget the land of your birth. Do not lightly esteem your origins. I pray that you grow to become instrumental pillars in the success story of the Warri Kingdom and the country at large. “I pledge to fund the education of 100 pupils of this great institution. May you all grow to be philanthropists in our lifetime,’’ the Olori prayed. With the national Children’s Day celebration only days away, the Queen is poised to rally key stake­holders within the region towards investing in the care and all-around education of children, especially those living in remote areas.
