As the battle for the presidential ticket of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) draws close, a chieftain of the party, Musa Aliyu Otigba has called on aspirants to shun do-or-die politics ahead of the presidential primary slated for June 6 and 7. Otigba who is also the leader of APC National Coalition for Mass Mobilisation 2023 made the call while speaking with journalists over the weekend in Abuja. According to the APC chieftain, all aspirants should unite and work together for the overall interest of the party. -Advertisement- Calling on the Senator Abdullahi Adamu-led National Working Committee (NWC), Otigba said the leadership of the party should take the issue of the reward system seriously in order to give party members a sense of belonging. He said, “When the primaries are over, we will all start talking to the people of Nigeria that they should vote for APC again come 2023. So we are mobilising the grassroots ahead of the election. “APC has so far spent seven years in power and seven years is not enough to say a party has failed or succeeded. That is why we are asking for another opportunity for the APC to prove itself.”
