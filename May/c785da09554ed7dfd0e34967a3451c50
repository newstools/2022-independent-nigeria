Jurgen Klopp says Liverpool have sent a message to Steven Gerrard ahead of Aston Villa’s clash against the Reds’ title rivals Manchester City. The race for the Premier League title is going down to the final day of the season, with Klopp’s side just a point behind league leaders City. Liverpool face Wolves at Anfield on Sunday, while City take on Gerrard’s Villa at the Etihad Stadium. -Advertisement- The Reds legend has a chance to help steer the title towards the grasp of his former club, and while Klopp hasn’t called Gerrard ahead of the weekend, the German coach revealed Liverpool already have. ‘Stevie will take it 100 per cent seriously, I am sure, without me calling him or whatever, I don’t have. The rest of the club probably already did it but I didn’t,’ said Klopp. ‘This [City vs Villa] is the game I am not concerned about, not thinking about, at all. Of all the things we speak about it is completely disrespectful to Wolves. ‘They don’t want to come here and be part of our celebrations. They come here and want to get three points, definitely. We have to be ready for this game, not the other one.’ Gerrard, meanwhile, is disappointed to have his integrity questioned and remains fully focused on securing points for Villa POLL ‘It is disappointing when people mention integrity and aim it towards me or Aston Villa or any of my players,’ said the Villa boss. ‘We’ll go out at the weekend and give it everything we’ve got to try and get points for Aston Villa and our supporters. If that inevitably helps Liverpool, fantastic, but my priority is to try and get points for Aston Villa. ‘We’ve got three massive points to play for, we’ve got an opportunity to finish the season on a high. It would be nice if we can reward our supporters with something at the weekend. ‘In terms of Liverpool, I totally understand and respect the external noise and the questions that have been coming my way for some time. They’re involved in a title race and I spent a lot of time there.’
