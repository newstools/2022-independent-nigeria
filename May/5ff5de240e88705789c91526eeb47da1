The first visible support group of former Anambra State Governor and Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) presidential aspirant, Peter Obi, has stated strongly that the man they stand solidly behind for the presidency of Nigeria come 2023 is in the race to win. The group known as Like Minds 4 Peter Obi were furious as rumours, propaganda and outright lies continue to circulate that the Anambra State Governor is considering withdrawing from his party’s primary election scheduled for May 29. It will be recalled that this very group purchased the declaration of interest and nominations forms for Obi way back in early April. -Advertisement- Speaking through their spokesperson, Mr Tagbo Obiora, the group responded emphatically to journalists who sought his group’s view at a recent function in Abuja. “It is delusional for some people out there to suggest or contrive that Peter Obi will withdraw from the race.” “A person leading a marathon race does not just wake up and quit. Peter Obi has been visiting delegates in their various States to engage them directly while most aspirants sat in one place.” “Attempts to de-market Peter Obi is actually rallying Nigerians behind him.” “Of all the aspirants across party lines, Peter Obi is the only one tackling issues Nigerians need answers to,” Obiora concluded, laying to rest the unfounded speculations of Obi stepping down.
