A case has been made for a sustainable lifestyle to stem the looming food and energy crises that may arise from the current climate change occasioned by the environmental pollution and general mismanagement. This is the submission at a one-day Conference in Lagos on the Preservation of the Environment, themed “Journeying and Listening Together: Energy Crisis and Sustainable Lifestyle for Church and State” which was organized by the Ecology Work Group of the catholic Archdiocese of Lagos. Speakers one after another decried the abuse of the environment by man and the inherent danger to the man’s wellbeing and the society at large. -Advertisement- Catholic Archbishop of Lagos, Most Rev. Alfred Adewole Martins kicked off the discussion when he lamented that many activities of man have given rise to climate change the consequences of which are now staring the society in the face. He stated that the climate change has manifested itself in varied and unprecedented ways such as heat waves that have led to the uncontrolled forest fires devastating huge swathes of land; progressing desertification; rising sea level leading to the destructive floods and landslides; chemical and technological pollution leading to depletion of biodiversity and destruction of the ecosystem. “We are faced with the results of our collective and individual lifestyles and habits that lead to depletion of species of animals and plants and the pollution of the earth, turning it to what the Pope calls pile of filth”, the clergy noted.
