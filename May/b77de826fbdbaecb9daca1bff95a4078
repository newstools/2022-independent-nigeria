Hon Imaan Sulaiman-Ibra­him, the Federal Commis­sioner, National Commission for Refugees Migrants and Internally Displaced Persons (NCFRMI), has described the on-going workshop of domes­tication of the African Union Convention on Internally Displaced Persons (Kampala Convention) as a worthwhile initiative. She said that domestica­tion would address the unique characteristics of internal displacement in African coun­tries, while also providing a clearer and stronger legal ba­sis for the protection of inter­nally displaced persons (IDPs). According to the Commis­sioner, Article 3 (2) of the KC provides that State Parties should incorporate, that is domesticate the KC into its domestic laws by enacting or amending relevant legis­lation. -Advertisement- Addressing delegates and international partners on Thursday in Lagos, Sulaiman Ibrahim, stated that the move marks the start of a new phase of inter-institutional engage­ment in the development of the long-awaited stand-alone domestication. She added that the Kam­pala Convention (KC) is a pio­neering instrument, the first legally binding instrument on IDPs, and is a standard-setting international instrument of regional scope on how to pro­vide protection and assistance as well as durable solutions for IDPs throughout the continent of Africa. “It provides an appropriate legal framework for the protec­tion and assistance of IDPs. It is geared towards ending internal displacements by ad­dressing the root causes, pro­viding durable solutions, and enhancing or addressing gaps where no legal instrument protects the housing, land, and property (HLP) rights of the vulnerable IDP.” She noted that the Kam­pala Convention covers all causes and phases of internal displacement and expressly commits both State parties and other stakeholders to act, to the extent of their capacity, to prevent displacement and to assist and protect internally displaced persons throughout their displacement until a du­rable solution is found.
