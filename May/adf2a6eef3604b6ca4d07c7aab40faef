The People’s Democratic Party (PDP) has denied the purported disqualification of the opposition spokesperson, Ikenga Imo Ugochinyere, from running on the platform of the party. This is coming barely 24 hours after Ikenga was referred to as a ‘disqualified’ aspirant. Addressing the PDP National Caucus in Abuja on the alleged disqualification of Ikenga, the National Secretary, Sam Anyawu denied the action and informed the party’s National Caucus that Ikenga is still in the race and was not disqualified. -Advertisement- He maintained that the documents in circulation were not from the party but forged documents put in circulation by mischief-makers, who wants to drag his name and the party into the mud. It will be recalled that the opposition spokesperson, Ikenga Imo Ugochinyere was cleared by the PDP National Assembly screening panel and issued a certificate of clearance after which the Appeal Panel upheld his clearance and a few days after, the social media and mainstream media platforms were awash with the strange report purporting his disqualification, which led to the present controversies and allegations of forgery and fabrication. The alleged disqualification, was, however, cleared before the National Caucus. The controversies that trailed the purported disqualification of Ikenga Imo Ugochinyere had ignited emotions in the state.
