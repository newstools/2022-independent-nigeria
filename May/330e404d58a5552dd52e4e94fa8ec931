Hayatudeen said he has garnered enough experience in his long years of experience in the corporate that will stand him in good stead to handle with ease all the problems that Nigeria is currently facing. -Advertisement- Hayatudeen, a respected player in the country’s corporate sector, described the PDP as the largest political party in Africa which accommodates ventilation of ideas from all members. He asserted that presently the country is so divided that brethren are fighting against brethren “to the point that our common heritage has been completely destroyed and shred into pieces.” He noted that access to good living which is enjoyed in other climes is not applicable to Nigeria despite the human and natural resources God blessed the country.
