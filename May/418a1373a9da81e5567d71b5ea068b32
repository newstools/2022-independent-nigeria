Lagos – As the Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) elections gathers momentum, one of those tipped to contest for the President seat of the football house, Shehu Dikko, has kept mum on his ambition. In a chat with our correspondent in Ikenne, Dikko, who is the current chairman of the League Management Company (LMC) and a board member of the NFF, parried the question when asked about his intention to contest in the elections. “For now, I don’t want to talk about the NFF elections. All am interested in is the growth and development of our league. -Advertisement- “We are here in Ikenne for the Nigeria Professional Football League (NPFL)/LaLiga U-15 championship and we are all happy and impressed with the organizational level of the championship and the skills displayed by the players. That should be okay for us for now. “I am not here to talk about the NFF elections or my intention to contest or not. Please let us leave that for now,” he pleaded. We gathered that incumbent president, Amaju Pinnick, his first Vice President, Niyi  Akinwunmi, Shehu Dikko, Amaze Uchegbulam and Fan Nduboke among others are angling to contest for the NFF top post. Recalled that the Federal Ministry of Youth and Sports Development has charged the NFF to set up machinery for the Federation’s general elections, which are expected to hold in September this year.
