Celebrated Nollywood writer and director is not slowing down on her strides anytime soon as her first cinema directorial effort, ‘Charge and Bail’ is now available for viewing on global streaming platform, Amazon Prime. One of her most notable Nigerian movie projects of 2021, ‘Charge and Bail’ is an unconventional story of survival and adaptation. It follows the life of Boma who always wanted to be a lawyer in the mould of her father. She aspires to work in his law firm but life had other plans for her as she got posted to somewhere else for her service year. -Advertisement- Boma, played by Zainab Balogun, gets posted to a rundown law firm, popularly called “charge and bail” in Nigerian parlance during her year of national service. Thrown into a life she is not used to, Boma had to dig into her inner being to adapt to her new reality; the people, the courts, and life. Speaking on the latest development, Uyoyou Adia says that her team pulled all the stops in making sure that they deliver on a movie that is not just relatable but also has a global appeal. According to Adia, getting accepted on a global streaming platform like Amazon Prime is a testament to the effort that Inkblot productions put into telling universal stories and she’s happy she was able to direct ‘Charge and Bail’ for the world to enjoy. “It has always been my goal to deliver on movies that entertain while passing subtle social messages. ‘Charge and Bail’ ticked all those boxes and provided an opportunity to once again, prove that there is joy in telling the world some of the beautiful stories that come out of Nigeria and Africa,” she said. A fun adventure story, ‘Charge and Bail’ also features Stan Nze, Femi Adebayo, Folu Storms, Tope Olowoniyan, Eso Dike, Craze Clown and Chigul, Bimbo Manuel, Chris Iheuwa, among others.
