Following the acquisition of the N100 million All Progressives Congress (APC) presidential form for aspirant Godwin Emefiele by his friends, he has come under heavy criticism from Nigerians. Reacting to the backlash, the Arewa Consultative Youth Movement (ACYM) has condemned the critics of the Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), insisting that he has done nothing against the laws of the country. The group, in a statement by its Coordinator, Yusuf Kabiru, Saturday argued that there was nothing wrong with the decision of the beneficiaries of the CBN governor’s reform in the critical sectors of the nation’s economy to purchase the forms for him. -Advertisement- The ACYM said it was excited, because, “Emefiele remained the only responsible and responsive person to succeed President Muhammadu Buhari in 2023”. The Arewa youths said with the purchase of the form, the APC and the country had moved a step closer to an Emefiele presidency in 2023. The statement read in part: “We commend the groups and their members who had the foresight to purchase the form to further convince Emefiele to join the race. They have shown that they are committed to national development. “Having studied Emefiele’s performance at the apex bank in the past years, we have no doubt that he holds the key to the expansion and consolidation of the nation’s economy. “We know for a fact that his Presidency will attract good tidings to Nigeria. All those who mean well for this country must therefore join their forces to ensure that he contests. POLL “Nigeria needs a selfless leader at this critical period of its history and we have found such attribute in Emefiele. “Those who are criticizing Emefiele based on the decision of the groups to purchase the forms for him are just playing to the gallery because the CBN governor is eminently qualified to contest the 2023 presidential election based on his competence and ability to turn the nation’s economy around.”
