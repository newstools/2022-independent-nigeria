Stating that Iran opposes the war in Ukraine, Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian said that political talks between Ukraine and Russia should lead to a cessation of war and ceasefire. Hossein Amir-Abdollahian made the remarks in a joint press conference with his Polish counterpart Zbigniew Rau on Sunday. “We talked about the latest developments in the region, as well as in Ukraine. We oppose the war in Ukraine, just as we oppose the war in Iraq, Afghanistan, Yemen, Syria and anywhere in the world. We believe that the solution in Ukraine is political, and the political negotiations between Ukraine and Russia should lead to a cessation of war and a ceasefire in this country,” he said. -Advertisement- “At the beginning of the war in Ukraine, in a telephone call with Polish Foreign Minister Rau, we announced the readiness of the Islamic Republic of Iran to send a 25-member medical team to the Ukrainian-Polish border, as well as to send humanitarian aid. Since the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) had deployed medical teams at the border, we were told that there was no need to send more medical teams at this time,” he added, stressing that Iran is still ready to do so. Amir-Abdollahian also pointed to his telephone conversations with the Ukrainian Foreign Minister, saying, “I have had telephone conversations with the Ukrainian Foreign Minister about the developments in the country three times. I also met with Mr. Lavrov on the sidelines of a meeting of Afghan foreign ministers in Tunxi, China, as well as my visit to Moscow, carrying the Ukrainian Foreign Minister’s message calling for a ceasefire and readiness for dialogue and agreement.” “We will continue our efforts in this regard and we hope to see peace, stability and security in all regions of the world,” he added.
