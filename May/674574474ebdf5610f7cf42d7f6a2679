Lagos – After qualifying for the 2023 Africa Under-20 Cup of Nations following the 2-1 defeat of the Baby Elephants of Cote d’Ivoire, President of the Nigeria Football Federation (NFF), Amaju Pinnick has charged players and coaches of the Flying Eagles not to relent on their efforts. He said: “You have done very well by qualifying for the tournament but that is not the end. You must strive ahead to keep up the tempo and not relent on our efforts. “You have scaled through one hurdle, but there are still hurdles to cross and one of those hurdles is the final match on Saturday. -Advertisement- As a result of that, you must relent on your efforts qualifying for the final of the tournament,” he said. The Flying Eagles, on Tuesday night overpowered fit-fighting Cote d’Ivoire in an explosive semifinal match to reach the final of the ongoing WAFU B U20 Championship in Niamey. The ticket to Saturday’s final also came with a ticket to next year’s Africa U20 Cup of Nations taking place in Egypt. Ubiquitous midfielder Daniel Daga put Nigeria in front after only five minutes when he cleverly escaped the attention of the Ivorian defenders to nod in from a wellweighted pull out. The seventime African champions then launched onslaught after onslaught on the Ivorian goal but failed to add to the tally, before the Ivorians equalized just before half time from an intelligently-taken free kick at the edge of Nigeria’s 18-yard box. POLL Neither team could find another goal to gain upper hand before the end of regulation time inside the Stade General Seyni Kountché, and the game went into extra time. Forward Ibrahim Yahaya got the winner for Nigeria in the 111th minute of play when he tucked in from the penalty spot to make it 2-1. Nigeria will square up against neighbours Benin Republic in Saturday’s final.
