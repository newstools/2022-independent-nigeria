AWKA – Prominent members of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Anambra State have withdrawn from the primary election of the party. Among them were the 2021 governorship candidates of the party in Anambra State, Mr. Valentine Chineto Ozigbo, former House of Representatives member, Dr. Tony Nwoye and four others as at the close of work on Thursday. In withdrawing from the race Ozigbo said he refused “to dignify the rot of the process by participating in Anambra South Senatorial Primary”, pointing accusing fingers at one of his opponents,  Chief Chris Uba and the National Working Committee (NWC). -Advertisement- According to him, “the actions of Chris Uba and the NWC-appointed minions have put the candidacy of many of our party faithful in legal jeopardy! “Our real problem lies in the blatant disregard for the rule of law. Instead of joining Chris Uba’s devious game of musical chairs, we ought instead to focus on how to clean the house and restore peace, order, and unity to the PDP. “The actions of Chris Uba and Linus Ukachukwu, with the support of Uche Ekwunife, Stella Oduah, and a few others are the reasons PDP in Anambra may end up fielding no candidates in the 2023 elections”, Ozigbo concluded. Also, a letter written by Dr. Tony Nwoye withdrawing from the Anambra North Senatorial election hinted at a similar situation. Other aspirants who withdrew from the race on the platform of PDP included Lady Juliet Anaeme who withdrew from the House of Assembly contest for Ekwusigo state constituency and resigned from PDP also; Chief Andrew Onwurah Azike withdrew from contesting the Aguata Federal Constituency seat and also resigned from the PDP. Others are Hon Obiora Chira who withdrew from contesting the Oyi/Ayamelum Federal Constituency seat as well as Hon. Idu Emeka withdrew from contesting the House of Representatives seat of  Onitsha North and South Federal Constituency.
