P/HARCOURT – Transport activities were grounded to a halt last week at Onne Federal Ocean Terminal, FOT, Rivers State following a disagreement between two transport unions: Maritime Flat And Cargo and Freight Forwarding transport union. Trouble started a fortnight ago, following what those in the Marine industry described as an unwarranted and astronomical increase in the price of transportation of containers from the Port to their various destinations and who controls the park. The disagreement, our correspondent learnt resulted to a Free- for- all fight which resulted in the damaging beyond repair of two Vehicles, a Toyota Siena Car and one Nissan Mitsubishi bus belonging to the two unions including their office accommodation, a 40 Foot container which an eye witness, said was lifted with the hands and turned upside down by the warring factions. -Advertisement- The incident subsequently led to the closure of the main transit Park at the FOT gate by a combined team of Nigerian Ports Authority, DSS, Navy and the Police. As at the time of filling this report, the gate was still under lock and key. Speaking to Daily Independent on the sideline of the development, Comrade Obinna Ugochukwu, Chairman Association of Registered Freight Forwarders, Onne Sea Port chapter described the situation as unfortunate and regrettable that the two transport unions could wake up one day and jack up the price of transportation of containers without due process. According to him, those Unions have no locus to do that as the regulation of such was the sole responsibility of the Nigerian shippers Council. Speaking further, comrade Ugochukwu regretted that such actions of the two unions have resulted in the loss of Billions of Naira for the federal Government, Importers and Clearing Agents among others.
