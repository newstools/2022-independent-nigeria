The mood is positive in the PSG camp right now following the extension of Kylian Mbappe. The Parisian juggernaut has committed a hefty contract in order to keep hold of the Frenchman and going forward, the player is going to play a key role in the club’s management. In any case, PSG were expected to undergo a major overhaul in the summer, with the club more than likely to fire both Mauricio Pochettino and sporting director Leonardo Araujo. Luis Campos has emerged as the favourite to replace Araujo as the sporting director. And according to Le10Sport, the Portuguese mastermind is set to introduce widespread changes to the squad. -Advertisement- Among his many wishes, one of them is to sign a quality central midfielder to accompany the talented Marco Verratti, with Campos particularly keen on the services of Frenkie de Jong. The Barcelona midfielder has been a subject of speculations linking him to a move away from Camp Nou, in recent weeks. The club themselves are open to a sale, knowing the player could bring in a significant transfer revenue that could go a long way in helping Barça land their top targets such as Robert Lewandowski and Raphinha. Manchester United are the other club involved in the race to sign Frenkie. The player has even had talks with coach Erik ten Hag over his prospects at Old Trafford. But the report suggests PSG could have the upper hand as the Dutchman wants to play in the Champions League. Man United, to that end, could fall behind in the race as they are only expected to compete in the Europa League next term. POLL It was initially thought that Frenkie de Jong had no intentions of leaving Barça. But it has been reported lately that the midfielder has already given his “farewell gifts” to the Barcelona fans, thus hinting at a potential exit at the end of the season.
