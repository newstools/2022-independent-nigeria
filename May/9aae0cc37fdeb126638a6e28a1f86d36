LAGOS  – The Federal Government has stated that it cannot increase emoluments or downsize workers without productivity measurement. Senator Chris Ngige, Minister of Labour and Employment, said this in his welcome address at the 3rd National Productivity Summit in Abuja, organised by the National Productivity Centre (NPC). Ngige explained that Nigeria cannot make progress without productivity measurement in various sectors of the national economy, including the public service, banking, business and agriculture. -Advertisement- The Minister, who advocated for the propagation of the culture of productivity, also stressed the need for Nigeria to measure her productivity as a country. According to him, productivity as the efficient and effective management of available resources, remains a key factor that enables societies to generate wealth and sustain development. He said: “We must propagate the culture of productivity. Some people are suggesting that we should downsize because a lot of people are at work. You cannot do that without measuring productivity. “Same goes with emoluments. Some people work in ministries while others work in parastatals like NNPC and FIRS. They are not equally paid. The huge disparity in wages does not give cheer. How we can bridge the gap in wages is important.” He blamed the disparity in wages for rebellions by labour unions, culminating in incessant industrial disputes.
