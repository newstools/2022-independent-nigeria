A family in Buderim, Australia, had to call on a specialist to help remove four large carpet pythons that had invaded their home’s backyard deck. For over two weeks, six snakes in total have showed up at the house. The family called reptile specialist Sunshine Coast Snake Catchers 24/7 to handle the issue when they couldn’t cope with the snakes invading their property. -Advertisement- Uploads of the video were caught on social media when one of their catchers, Stuart McKenzie, grabbed two of the carpet pythons before releasing them back into the wild. According to McKenzie, he had to stop by the house multiple times to catch the snakes with the last one being one of the thickest he has ever seen. “It’s not very often this happens but during the breeding season we regularly get called out for multiple snakes at one home,” he said.
