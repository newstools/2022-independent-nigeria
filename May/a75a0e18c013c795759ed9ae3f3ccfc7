Matthijs de Ligt is set to sign a new contract with Juventus, according to reports in Italy, despite interest in him from Manchester United and Barcelona. The 22-year-old’s current deal runs until 2024 and reports had suggested that Juve were willing to listen to big offers for him – bids in the region of £70m. Spanish giants Barcelona were linked with a bid as Xavi continues his rebuild at the Camp Nou, while incoming Manchester United boss Erik ten Hag was thought to want to link up with his former Ajax star again. -Advertisement- However, Diario Sport report that the Dutchman will not be seeking pastures new this year and is instead putting pen to paper on a new contract in Turin that will run till 2026. This will maintain some stability at Juventus, with Giorgio Chiellini leaving the club after an epic 18-year stint in Turin which has seen him play 560 times for the Old Lady. De Ligt does not turn 23 until August but has already racked up an incredible amount of top level experience. He made 117 appearances for Ajax before making the €75m (£63m) switch to Juve in July 2019 and he has since made over 100 appearances for the Italian giants. It has been his busiest season so far for Juve, making 40 appearances in all competitions, but it has been a disappointing one for the team as they are set to finish fourth in Serie A, going into the last game of the season. POLL Juventus have a trip to Fiorentina ahead of them for their final match of the season, but they cannot change their fourth place whatever the result.
