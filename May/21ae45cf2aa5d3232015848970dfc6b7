Again, the residents of Chibok Local Government Area of Borno State are currently fleeing for safety outward their settlements following a heavy attack from invading terrorists believed to be members of the Islamic State of West Africa Province (ISWAP). The area, which gained international recognition for the wrong reason when about 270 girls of the Government Girls Secondary School, Chibok, now infamously known as The Chibok Girls, were abducted in 2014, has known little peace since then. The latest attack is said to be taking place at Kautukari, a community in the Local government, about 17km away from Chibok town. -Advertisement- where the terrorists were said have stormed at about 6pm and started shooting indiscriminately, and setting houses on fire while the residents are fleeing for safety in nearby bushes. Soldiers stationed at a military Forward Operation Base (FOB) in Kada, just two km away from Kautukari, were said to have been overpowered, though, troops from the army’s 117 battalions in Chibok town, are said to have been mobilised to the area.
