Convener of the 2022 Plateau Cultural Carnival, Debrah Jalmet, has hinted that this year’s event is targeted at boosting native understand­ing, love for another, societal advancement, security and ethno-religious unity. Speaking with newsmen in Jos on the Cultural Car­nival, Jalmet said the event would undoubtedly have a powerful impact on the soci­ety and the youths would be significant beneficiaries due to their strategic position in the society and a quality as­pect of the event targeted at them. According to her, the event would hold this Friday at the Crest Hotel in Jos and par­ticipants are expected from across the 17 local govern­ment areas of the state. -Advertisement- “The Plateau Cultural Car­nival is more than an event. We envision it to be a way of life, because our cultural values must be imbibed in our everyday life and activi­ties. Our culture is gradually fading out. This is why we in­vite all custodians of culture, Plateau people, organisations and the government to active­ly participate in the event.
