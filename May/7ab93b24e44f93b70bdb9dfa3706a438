LAGOS – After years of planning, and a little over 12 months of building and refurbishment work, The Africa Centre – celebrating contemporary African culture and heritage, is finally ready to welcome its patrons and supporters to its new home in Southwark, London on 9th June. It will continue to act as a bold and transformative bridge between the continent, Africans, and friends of Africa all over the world from its base in one of the world’s most international and exciting cities, London, according to a release to Daily Independent-Nigeria. Southwark was chosen for its multicultural character and its proximity to several other iconic cultural institutions such as Tate Modern, the Southbank Centre, The Old and Young Vic theatres, Shakespeare’s Globe and the future site of the V&A East. -Advertisement- Spread over four floors, phase one of its redevelopment will see an African restaurant and lounge bar on the ground and first floors and spaces for exhibitions, debates and events on the second. Phase two, (to follow), plans a whole floor devoted to education, connecting the UK with Africa via interactive education initiatives teaching African history through the Centre’s digitised archives as well as offering language classes. Meanwhile, the fourth floor will be a business suite offering black businesses and individuals the opportunity to mingle, network, and grow, added in the statement. Oba Nsugbe, Board Chair, The Africa Centre, while speaking about the renovation, said: “Over the decades, since its launch in 1964, The Africa Centre played a key role in being a home away from home for the African diaspora. It has been a safe place and key platform for African activists, intellectuals and artists to discuss and drive the African narrative. “With time, our mission and purpose have grown and transformed to not only represent the first generation of Africans, but also the second and third generation of Africans and Afro-Caribbeans.”
