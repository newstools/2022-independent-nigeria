ABUJA – APC Chieftain and Convener, Northern Conscience for 2023 (NCfor2023), Dr. Garus Gololo, has warned Nigerians against voting person’s with undemocratic tendencies into office. He also urged people to focus on the capacity of political office seekers to unite the country, and to implement policies that will usher in economic reforms and peaceful coexistence across the country. In an interview in Abuja, Gololo assessed aspirants vying for the post of President on the platforms of the two major political parties;. All Progressives Congress (APC) and Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). -Advertisement- He lamented that many of the aspirants “Are time wasters who have no significant plan for the country.” Singling out the Rivers State Governor, Nyesom Wike, he insisted that the governor has “nothing much to offer Nigerians. “Moreover, he is not a democrat. For a Governor to ask the police to detain an opponent without recourse to suing the person, especially since he, (Wike) is a lawyer, tells you the kind of person he is.” “Also, this is one man that has demonstrated zero religious tolerance in his state.” “Gololo opined that “Wike will make a terrible leader if voted President.” POLL On recent directive by President Muhammadu Buhari, instructing political appointees with electoral ambitions to resign on or before May 16, the APC Chieftain while commending the President for the action, insisted that it ought to have come earlier than now. He added that “It is immoral for political appointees to continue to stay in office while seeking elective positions.” According to him, that will amount not only to conflict of interest, but to abuse of office.
