IBADAN – The founder of One Love Family, Satguru Maharaj ji has insisted that the next Nigerian president must come from the Southern part of the country in continuation of power rotation system. Maharaj ji who made this known at weekend in Lagos while addressing a World Press Conference said the All Progressives Congress, (APC)  has been in power for seven years and that there is the need for visible, reliable, credible general election in 2023, where the next president will come from the south. He however said the president can come from any political party as long as the party has been given the mandate by majority of Nigerians. -Advertisement- He said the north has been in power in the last seven years and that for equity and fairness, it is the turn of the south. “Don’t forget that there was a moral agreement between all Nigerian leaders to rotate power between north and south in 1999. Therefore ,we must not joke with power rotation and federal character which has helped immensely in our search for a democratic safe landing for a united Nigeria. “The North is the North, whether North East, North Central, North West, it is still the North. Let’s maintain this togetherness, this oneness. “The Peoples Democratic Party, (PDP) created the zoning system to enhance civility and smooth transition from one zone /tribe to the other for peace, love and harmony to reign. “This zoning process has to be adopted by all other political parties to usher in an era of peaceful transition from one party in power to the other as Africans are always their brother’s keeper. POLL “Nigeria is the giant of Africa because of our large population. Why do we have to bring in divisiveness/divisions in our system. We are what we are because we are one . Nobody can divide us”. Maharaj ji also expressed his disappointment with the calibre of presidential aspirants across party lines saying most of them have garbage of corruption cases hanging around their necks.
