The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has urged the Federal Government to attend to the needs of the Academic Staff Union of Universities(ASUU) in order for the academic strike to be called off in the spirit of May Day celebration. This was disclosed in a statement issued by the party’s National Publicity Secretary, Hon Debo Ologunagba, on Sunday, urging the government to halt an imminent collapse of the public education sector. The statement partly read, “The PDP calls upon the Federal Government to immediately attend to the industrial action by lecturers in our public universities so as to halt an imminent collapse of our public education sector”. According to Ologunagba, “it is lamentable that the arrogance in failure and insensitivity of the APC government towards the welfare of workers continue to dislocate our Social Order and cripple our major productive sectors with a grave negative ripple effect on millions of families and the nation at large. “The deliberate general stagnation on issues of the welfare of workers reflects the ugly reality in our nation under a government that apparently relishes the suffering of its citizens. “Such selfish inattentiveness, corruption and incompetence of the APC administration is responsible for the closure of our public universities as the government continues in its brazen failure to attend to the demands of striking university lecturers and millions of stranded university students in our country.”
