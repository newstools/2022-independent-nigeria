Speaking exclusively to Reshad Rehman, journalist Toni Juanmarti has claimed that Barcelona are interested in Liverpool winger Sadio Mane ahead of the summer transfer window. Mane has been with Liverpool since 2016 when he joined from Southampton and has grown into an icon at Anfield. The Senegalese speedster has been vital to all the success that the Reds have achieved in recent years under Jurgen Klopp. The 30-year-old is also enjoying a brilliant 2021/22 season, having managed 20 goals and three assists in 46 games to help Liverpool win the Carabao Cup and make it to the finals of the FA Cup and the UEFA Champions League while staying in the hunt for the Premier League title. -Advertisement- However, Mane’s contract with Liverpool stands to expire in 2023, which has brought out some speculation over his future. And, it seems like Barcelona are keeping tabs on the situation of the former Red Bull Salzburg attacker as they look to bolster their frontline. It is no secret that the Catalan giants are in the market for attacking reinforcements. Names like Erling Haaland and Robert Lewandowski have been mentioned heavily as targets, but things are not looking good for the Blaugrana on either front. So, alternatives are being looked at by the management, and as per Toni Juanmarti, Mane is a name that interests the Barça board, along with Manchester City’s Gabriel Jesus. Mane, in particular, is seen as a target due to his quality along with his contract situation at Anfield. The 30-year-old, who led Senegal to the Africa Cup of Nations triumph earlier this year, will have just 12 months left on his deal at Anfield at the end of the season. While there have been talks of a contract renewal for Mohamed Salah, not much has been reported about a new deal for Mane. And in case negotiations are delayed, Barça might consider a swoop for the speedster, who can play anywhere across the frontline.
