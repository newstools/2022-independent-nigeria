It was at this point we all walked out in protest” Dr Sarpiya alleged. He demanded that the Governorship Primaries held on 26th may 2022 this week should be considered not free and fair and should be set aside and as well called for a review of Congress es from the ward level upwards for the proper election of delegates to participate in another primary to produce a credible candidate.
