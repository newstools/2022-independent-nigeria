Villarreal will have their work cut out when they face Liverpool in the Champions league semi-final second leg on Tuesday. Unai Emery’s team need to overcome a 2-0 deficit from Anfield against a Reds’ side seeking a historic quadruple of the Champions League, Premier League, FA Cup and League Cup titles. Villarreal have already exceeded expectations by reaching the last four after upsetting former champions Juventus and Bayern Munich. What makes the task for the Spanish side tougher is that they enter the clash on the back of Saturday’s 2-1 loss to Alaves that left them seventh in La Liga. For them, winning the Champions League is the only way back into the competition next season. Villarreal also have to contend with the fact that Liverpool have not lost by a two-goal margin in 56 games all season. If Klopp’s team avoid such a defeat on Tuesday, they will be into a third Champions League final in five seasons. Liverpool made five changes from the side that beat Villarreal when they played at Newcastle on Saturday despite being involved in a Premier League title race. The second-placed team managed to secure the 1-0 win that keeps them a point behind Manchester City, even as star striker Mohamed Salah was only needed on the field for 25 minutes. Fabinho and Thiago Alcantara also only came on in the second half, while Ibrahima Konate and Trent Alexander-Arnold didn’t come off the bench at all. They are expected to play a greater role on Tuesday.
