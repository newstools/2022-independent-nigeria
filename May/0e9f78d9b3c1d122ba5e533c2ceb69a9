Wanted drug kingpin behind the 2000.6kg cannabis sativa seized in a concrete mixer truck in Adamawa State on December 2, 2021, Henry Chukwuneku Okamaru, a.k.a. Lawrence Ik Okamaru, has been arrested in Ondo State after five months of manhunt by operatives of the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA). Two suspects, Matthew Donuwe and Friday Nmborgwu, were arrested in connection to the consignment last December. They had confessed that the concrete mixer truck with Lagos registration number SMK 890 XB was loaded with the illicit drug in Ogbese, Ondo State, while they travelled for two months on the road before arriving Adamawa where they were eventually arrested by NDLEA operatives. A statement by Femi Babafemi, Director, Media & Advocacy, NDLEA, said investigations reveal that Okamaru is one of the leaders of a cannabis cultivation cartel that operates in the Ondo-Ekiti axis, while he shuttles between Osun, Ondo, Ekiti, Edo and Delta states from where he coordinates supplies of illicit consignments to Northern parts of the country and Lagos State. -Advertisement- It said the drug lord has also been identified as a member of an international drug trafficking ring, while he shuttles between Nigeria and South Africa where he settles his family. “He has a strong control and stake in cannabis cultivation in Ondo, Edo, Ekiti, Osun and Oyo states with large storage facilities in Lagos and Abbi in Delta State from where his consignments are distributed year round”, the statement noted. NDLEA also said a 36-year-old Nigerian based in Italy, Nwakanma Michael Uche, has been arrested at the Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport (NAIA), Abuja, for ingesting pellets of heroin. The agency said Nwakanma, who hails from Arodizuogu village, Ideato Local Government Area of Imo State, was nabbed while trying to board Air France Airline en route Abuja-Paris- Milan, Italy on Sunday, May 15, 2022.
