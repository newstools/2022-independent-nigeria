Lagos – Coach Erasmus Onuh of Heartland is upbeat on rescuing the club from relegation. The coach replaced Hassan Abd’Allah in February so as to help steer the club out of relegation zone after losing seven games from the opening 10 of the season. Three months after, Onuh is still struggling to lift the club out of the relegation zone after 17 games with five wins, six draws and six defeats. -Advertisement- Reviewing the loss to Rangers in Awka, Onuh told NPFL.ng that he had little to complain about the loss, but praised their opponents saying they were the better side. He also praised Heartland players’ doggedness and dedication throughout the game despite not possessing the same caliber of players as Rangers. He pointed out some internal administrative deficiencies that he believed affected the players. “They have more experienced players than us. We do not have any reason to complain at all because they played better. We also made an impact, which I believe you can all attest to. POLL “Since I arrived here, we have tried to get out of the relegation zone a couple of times but without the logistics, things won’t go the way they ought to go. We can move mountains when the logistics are there but when they are not there, we can only struggle the way we were at present.” Onuh, who has worked with a number of clubs in the league including Niger Tornadoes, said that he was already focusing on their next game in Owerri against Rivers United, which he insisted that Heartland must win so as to boost their continued chase for survival. “We lost to Rangers because they were more experienced but we must ensure that we prepare well for Rivers United with all logistics put in place. We cannot afford to lose any more home games but all must play their part to make things work as expected.”
