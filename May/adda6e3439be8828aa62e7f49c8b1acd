ABUJA – Emefiele Support Group (ESG) has advised some Nigerians calling for the resignation of the Governor of Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Godwin Emefiele, to desist from such calls. The ESG described such calls as a distraction to the CBN governor, who is committed to repositioning the nation’s economy. The group also took the Ondo State Governor, Rotimi Akeredolu, Prof. Itse Sagay and Omowole Sowore to the cleaners, describing them as tribal commentators. -Advertisement- The ESG, in a statement by its Director of Communications, Benigma Ejimba, faulted Akeredolu, Sagay and Sowore for remaining silent on the issue of President of African Development Bank and former Minister of Agriculture, Dr. Akiwunmi Adesina, who 28 groups raised money and bought the same form for, while they were busy feasting on that of Emefiele. “You asked the CBN governor to resign but kept mute on Adesina, ADB President, how do we describe this if not being tribal?” the group asked. In the same vein, the Arewa Consultative Youths Movement (ACYM), Ohanaeze Ndigbo Youths Movement, Oduduwa Youths and Middle Belt Youths, described both Akeredolu and Sagay as ethnic jingoists.
