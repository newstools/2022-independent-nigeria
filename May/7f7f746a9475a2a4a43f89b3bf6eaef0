Lagos – Enyimba of Aba manager, Finidi George, has promised to bring his best at the table having been appointed the first assistant coach of the three times African champions, the Super Eagles. The former Super Eagles winger in a chat with our correspondent said he would give his best in order to make sure the national team regains its glory after failing to qualify for the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar. “I am happy that I was appointed to be part of the coaches of the Super Eagles; it is one appointment that I relish so much,” the UEFA Champions League winner with Ajax said. -Advertisement- “One thing I know very well is that I will do my best within the confines of my position to help the team make impact. But what I will also tell Nigerians is to have faith in the team and be patient with the new coaches,” he further said. Recall that in the recent reshuffling of the coaching department of the Super Eagles, Finidi George was appointed the first assistant coach of the team below Coach Jose Paseiro of Portugal. For the second assistant coaching position, the football house announced the hitherto first assistant coach, Salisu Yusuf, as the man in that position, among other appointments. Super Eagles will be up against the duo of Mexico and Ecuador in international friendlies billed for the United States of America (USA). POLL The two games will prepare the team for the 2023 Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) qualifiers which start towards the end of the month.
