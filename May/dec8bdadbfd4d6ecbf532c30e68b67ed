He thanked his team mates, the coaching crew and Nigerians for their prayers and supports. It will be recalled that Nigeria has not won the title since its inception in 2018. Nigeria’s U20 boys, Flying Eagles, on Friday night emerged champions of the West Africa B Zone when they defeated the Young Squirrels of Benin Republic 3-1 in the final of the WAFU B U20 Champi­onship in Niamey, capital of Niger Republic. POLL Nigeria, seven-time African champions, were worthy winners of the trophy. They started their campaign with a 2-0 spank­ing of tournament title holders and continental champions Ghana, before a 2-2 draw with Burkina Faso that took them to the last four. In the semifinals, they were stretched to the limit by an Ivorian team with a blistering pace and superb turn, but edged the tie 2-1 after extra time. And in the final they defeated Benin Repub­lic 3-1 to win the trophy. Thus, Nigeria and Benin Republic will fly WAFU B zone’s flag at the 2023 Af­rica U20 Cup of Nations in Egypt.
