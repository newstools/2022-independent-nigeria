Earlier in the week, Spotify announced six African artistes joining RADAR – the music streaming giant’s programme dedicated to the spotlight and discovery of emerging artists across the world. The full list of artistes from Ghana, Kenya, Nigeria and South Africa includes DBN GOGO, Ayra Starr, Black Sherif, Victony, BNXN and Buruklyn Boyz. This batch of artistes follows in the footsteps of other African talents like Elaine, Willy Cardiac, Tems and Focalistic who all joined the programme in 2020 and were exposed to new global fan communities on the platform as a result. “It gives me so much joy to bring back our RADAR Africa program and to do so within a deservingly bigger and better format. It is so important that we continue to identify and find ways to offer developing artistes a fair chance at success on and off platform. We have six outstanding ones from the region, to begin with, and look forward to sharing in their journey while we provide the resources to elevate them to the next level of their respective careers, and hopefully make thousands more Spotify fans around the world,” said Phiona Okumu, Head of Music, Spotify Africa. -Advertisement- Since its launch, RADAR has driven an increase in listening and furthered fan-artist connections and, as part of the programme, these artists will receive editorial, on-platform and off-platform support from Spotify to help broaden their respective fanbases. Moreover, as part of its Global Hub launch, Spotify will prioritise the promotion of RADAR playlists, RADAR podcasts, Spotify Singles, and priority releases from RADAR artistes across all regions.
