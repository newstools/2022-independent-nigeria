AWKA – An attempt to conduct a three-man delegate election by a faction of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Anambra state for purposes of conducting a state Congress ended up in fracas in Awka on Wednesday. All was set but the election was for Anambra North and South Senatorial districts. In attendance were Senator Stella Odua, Senator Alphonsus Obi Igbeke, Hon. Ngozi Agudosi and so on. -Advertisement- The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) team was led by Mr. Ibe U. Ibe while Mr. Efere Augustine led the Electoral Committee. Nevertheless, midway into the process, it was noticed that contestants from Oyi Local Government did not attend the congress and a little time later, fracas broke out forcing participants to run helther skelter. However, addressing the press, the party’s zonal chairman and chairmanship aspirant, Hon. Ngozi Agudosi said the election was brought to Awka because of insecurity in the state. He applauded concerned leaders of the party for organising the election.
