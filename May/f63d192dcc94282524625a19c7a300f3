Three support groups were responsible for raising N100 million for the purchase of nomination and expression of interest forms for the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) Governor, Godwin Emefiele, to join the race to contest the 2023 Presidency on the platform of the All Progressives Congress (APC). According to Punch, a source who is close to the CBN governor revealed that the Rice Farmers Association, Emefiele Support Group, and Friends of Godwin purchased the forms. “Three groups are buying forms for him; Rice Farmers are buying, Emefiele Support Group is buying, Friends of Godwin are buying. -Advertisement- “But he has not accepted any of the forms yet. Buying forms doesn’t mean he’s running for the Presidency,” the source said.
