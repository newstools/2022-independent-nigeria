LAGOS – State and Federal Governments have been called upon to adopt the Igbo apprenticeship system to end the youth unemployment in the country. Dr. Obiora Okonkwo, the chairman of United Nigeria Airlines, made the call on Thursday in Lagos in his key­note address at the All Markets Conference 2022 with the theme: ‘’Development and Sustainabil­ity of the Nation’s Economy,’’ held by the Ndigboamaka Pro­gressive Traders’ Association in Lagos. Okonkwo explained that the Igbo apprenticeship scheme has the capacity to mop up the army of unemployed youths and en­gage them meaningfully. -Advertisement- He stated that the Federal and state governments have the ca­pacity to enter into agreements with traders and other trades­men to provide tutelage to youths and reduce unemployment. He said the scheme, which had proven to be a success among the Igbo people and had helped them to create wealth, can be replicated across the country with the government providing the needed guaran­tees for start-up funds. “I call on governments across Nigeria to explore the benefits of the apprenticeship system practiced by the Igbo people and use it to address youth unemployment and fight criminality. “What it takes is a policy on the placement of willing youths in businesses that will take them through tutelage for a period of time while the gov­ernment empowers them with start-up funds upon comple­tion”, he said. According to him, unem­ployment has become the big­gest contributor to insecurity across the country, adding that for the government to effective­ly tackle the situation, it must begin to think outside the box to see other ways of addressing the problem.
