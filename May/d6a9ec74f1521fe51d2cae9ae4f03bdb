Henrikh Mkhitaryan’s proposed free transfer from Roma to Inter this summer is a done deal, according to various reports in Italy. The Armenia international started the Giallorossi’s victorious Europa Conference League Final clash with Feyenoord but left the pitch through injury after just 17 minutes. Il Corriere dello Sport among others report Mkhitaryan has told Roma he will not be extending his contract which expires on June 30 and will instead move to Inter. -Advertisement- The reports suggest he will sign a two-year contract worth €3.5 million net per year and will undergo a medical once he has recovered from the thigh injury which saw him withdrawn against Feyenoord. Mkhitaryan shot to prominence when he joined Shakhtar Donetsk in 2010 from his native Armenia. He spent three years in Ukraine and won league and cup doubles in every season. He then moved to Borussia Dortmund where he twice won the German Super Cup before leaving for Manchester United in 2016, where he claimed a League Cup and Europa League. Following 18 months at Arsenal, he joined Roma in 2019 and has made 116 appearances, scoring 29 goals.
