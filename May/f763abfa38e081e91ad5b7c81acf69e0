Reports in Mexico suggest Liverpool have Napoli attacking winger Hirving ‘Chucky’ Lozano on their transfer list for this summer. According to Kerynews, Lozano has attracted attention from the Premier League side, who will play against Real Madrid in the Champions League Final. Lozano turns 27 in July and is under contract with Napoli until June 2024, but his position at the Stadio Diego Armando Maradona is far from certain. -Advertisement- He was signed from PSV Eindhoven in 2019 for €35m and never quite lived up to those expectations, also due to injury issues. So far this season, Chucky has contributed six goals and six assists in 35 competitive games for Napoli. He has played primarily on the left wing in Serie A, although his more natural role is on the right. This tactical versatility would make him a useful addition for Liverpool and their trident attack. Although there is a release clause in his contract believed to be worth €130m, the real asking price would be closer to €30-40m.
