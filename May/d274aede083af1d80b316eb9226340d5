As the 2023 general elections gathered momentum across the country, Max Ogah a lawyer has said that regional feelings and religious affiliation will play a major role during the presidential primaries in the two major political parties . The lawyer who made the observation when he appeared on Channels TV’s Politics Today on Tuesday said that state governors would determine who emerges as presidential candidates in both political parties, as they have control over delegates. Speaking alongside two other guests, Ogah discussed the behaviour of delegates as the All Progressives Congress (APC) and People’s Democratic Party (PDP’s) presidential primary elections approach. -Advertisement- While the PDP is expected to conduct its 2023 presidential primary election on May 26, the APC will hold its primary election on May 28 and 29. According to him, North West would also play a major role during the primary elections, as it has the largest number of delegates. He said, “I don’t think the man from Niger will look at Yahaya Bello’s emergence as a president as something that will bring him, any benefit. We don’t divorce our politics from sentiment. “I don’t think the man from Nasarawa will see a presidential ticket being dropped in Kogi as his. “So there is going to be a split. People will take position base on religion and ethnicity or tribal leanings, and all of that.”
