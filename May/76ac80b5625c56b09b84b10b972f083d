Liverpool are still in the hunt for a famous quadruple, but it has not stopped them from releasing their new home kit for the 2022/23 campaign. However, while the team is enjoying red hot form on the pitch, the reception from fans for this new kit has been rather on the cold side. Club partners Nike have a new template for their upcoming kits, with a raglan-style collar and a customisable trim to tailor the shirt for each club. -Advertisement- Liverpool‘s features a nod towards Anfield anthem You’ll Never Walk Alone, with a YNWA emblem etched into the sleeve trim, as well as a new tribute to the 97 victims of the Hillsborough disaster. The classic crimson red strip will also feature a new style of in-house name and numbers for cup competitions, with the likes of Mohamed Salah, Virgil van Dijk and Luis Diaz set to don the new shirt next season. However, fans aren’t too impressed with the otherwise uninspired design, with claims the shirt is ‘boring’, ‘plain’ and ‘dull’ as they reacted on social media. It’s Liverpool’s third year with their kit manufacturers Nike, in a multi-year deal worth a reported £70million per campaign. It’s sure to sell like hotcakes regardless of the frosty reception, although many supporters are now pining for the more unique designs of previous kit maker New Balance – whose strips often harked back to historic looks.
