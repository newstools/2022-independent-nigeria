The failure of parents, schools and leadership of the nation to engage Nigerian youths in scouting activities and other events that can build culture and good morals in young peo­ple has been attributed to the cause of social vices includ­ing drug addiction, fraud and insurgency, among others. Adebesin Oyeyemi Olohu­ntoyin, Scout Commissioner, Lagos State Scout Council, disclosed this in Lagos at the weekend during the investi­ture of chairman, National Youth Council of Nigeria, Lagos State Chapter, Lekan Biliaminu Sulaimon-Oba, as SHQ for Sustainable Goals, Lagos State Council by the Lagos State Scout Council. Lamenting that today, the aspect of good deeds and re­spect for citizens had gone out of our culture, Olohunto­yin said: “Scouting breeds culture. Every tribe has its own culture and tradition and scout goes into the tradi­tion to see how we can come back to good days and that we won’t derail. -Advertisement- “Until we go back to the basics, we won’t be able to achieve our aim. You can see that today, a lot of youths engage in so many vices, in­cluding drug addiction, Ya­hoo-yahoo- fraud, Boko Ha­ram, among others because they are not engaged.”
