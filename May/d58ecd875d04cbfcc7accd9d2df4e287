ABUJA – Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami, on Saturday disclosed that he has not resigned. Instead, Malami said he had withdrawn his ambition to con­test for the 2023 Kebbi State gu­bernatorial election. The AGF stated this in a statement by his media aide, Dr. Umar Gwandu. -Advertisement- “Malami has the right to choose to voluntarily shelve his gubernatorial ambition. It is a matter of personal convic­tion and individual right which didn’t violate any law. “Right thinking members of the society accord respect to individual’s right to freedom of choice in matters relating to this,” Gwandu stated. As individual Nigerian cit­izens with inalienable funda­mental rights, Malami said he was not aware of any legally justifiable and reasonable ten­able obligations compelling him, a SAN or as an Attorney General of the Federation to do otherwise. “The decision is not only a demonstration of altruism and patriotism, but of contentment, self-control, placidity and deci­siveness in problem-solving at a time shrouded with confusing and competing stimulus. “It is a commendable posture worthy of admiration coming from a paragon of virtue,” the statement said.
