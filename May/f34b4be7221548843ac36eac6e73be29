Ruben Dias, John Stones and Kyle Walker will miss the rest of Manchester City’s season, Pep Guardiola has said. City moved three points clear at the top of the Premier League table with a convincing 5-0 thrashing of Newcastle at the Etihad Stadium on Sunday. He confirmed that neither Walker, Stones nor Dias – who was forced off at half-time with a muscular problem – would be fit for their last three games of the season. -Advertisement- Speaking in his post-match press conference, Guardiola said: “Ruben, Kyle and John are out until the end of the season.”
