Lagos – Flying Eagles coach Ladan Bosso still has the full complement of his squad, and is unwilling to rest any of his regulars as he looks to make sure of a place in the last four of the ongoing WAFU B U20 championship in Niamey, Niger Republic. The Flying Eagles are expected to keep things intense but firm as they play the Junior Etalons of Burkina Faso in today’s (Wednesday) second Group B match. Both teams will take the pitch at 5pm at the Stade General Seyni  Kountché, the same venue where the Flying Eagles enacted a master class to send African champions the Black Satellites of Ghana tumbling on Sunday. -Advertisement- “We must approach the match against Burkina Faso with even stronger determination and desire than we did for the Ghana match. “A ticket to the semifinals is key at the moment, and we can then start thinking of a ticket to the final and a place in the Africa Cup of Nations(AFCON) nextyear.” Only the two finalists at the WAFU B Championship in Niamey will be eligible for next year’s Africa U20 Cup of Nations, already scheduled to take place in Egypt February/ March.
