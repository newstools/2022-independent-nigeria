All over the world, playing against a team that is fighting to remain afloat is very danger­ous and that will likely play out this weekend as league leaders, Rivers United, host almost rel­egated Mountain of Fire and Miracles Ministries (MFM) of Lagos. The Pride of Rivers are atop the league table with fifty five points from 26 games while their visitors this weekend are reeling at the base of the table with 24 points from the same number of matches played. Meanwhile, a likely win for the Pride of Rivers this week­end at the Yakubu Gowon Stadi­um in Port Harcourt will mean that the home team has done the double over their visitors. -Advertisement- Recall that in the first leg on January 19 in Lagos, a brace from Uche Onwuasoanya and a lone strike from Ishaq Kayo­de ensured that Rivers United defeated MFM 3-1. A solitary strike by Tosin Olubobola for the host could mean little for them. One thing will go against MFM in this fixture; the Olu­koya Boys have been very poor on the road this season. They have been able to pick only four points outside Lagos. They have lost a whooping nine games on the road and drew four. This is in a sharp contrast to the form of Rivers United in their home. The league leaders have won all but one match be­fore their fans, with the only exception being a goalless draw they recorded against Sunshine Stars recently. Speaking on the match this weekend, Coach Stanley Egu­ma of Rivers United said the game against MFM presents another chance for them to continue to push for their am­bition. “We have been taking it gradually and I hope that at the end of the season, we will get to our destination. I don’t want to say we are there yet because we are not. POLL “The game (against MFM) will be interesting because I know they will come fighting for survival and to me, it is an­other chance for us to continue to push forward. We hope t win this match and get closer to the title,” he said.
