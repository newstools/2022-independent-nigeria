ABUJA – The Nigerian National Pe­troleum Company (NNPC) has assured motorists that there is enough Premium Motor Spirit (PMS) otherwise known as petrol to go round in the Federal Capital Terri­tory (FCT) Abuja. This is even as queues con­tinue to increase in virtually all available petrol filling sta­tions across the nation’s cap­ital with many stations clos­ing shop for lack of products. In a statement, Garba Deen Muhammad, Group General Manager, Group Public Affairs Division of NNPC, urged motorists not to engage in panic buying as supplies are adequate. -Advertisement- “The NNPC notes the sudden appearance of fuel queues in parts of Abuja. This is very likely due to low load outs at depots which usually happen during long public holidays, in this case, the Sallah celebrations. “Another contributing fac­tor to the sudden appearanc­es of queues is the increased fuel purchases which is also usual with returning resi­dents of the FCT from the public holidays. “NNPC and the Nigerian Midstream and Downstream Petroleum Regulatory Au­thority (NMDPRA) in con­junction with our marketing partners have taken neces­sary measures to ramp up load outs from all depots. “We assure all residents of the FCT, and indeed all Nige­rians, that we have ample local supplies and national stock in excess of 2.5 billion liters, with sufficiency of more than 43 days. “The NNPC advises mo­torists not to engage in pan­ic buying as supplies are adequate and will become increasingly evident in the coming days,” the statement reads in parts.” POLL Independent reports that from Nyanya axis to Apo re­settlement, down the Kubwa, Dei Dei expressway there are long queues with motorists lamenting the return of fuel scarcity in the capital city. Mike Ozoemena, a taxi driver, told our correspon­dent that the situation had disrupted his day’s schedule as he did not anticipate scar­city at this time.
