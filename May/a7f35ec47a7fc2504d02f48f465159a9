EJIKEME OMENAZU The Bible Speak Conference, convened by Dr Bolaji O. Akinyemi, President, Voice of His Word Ministries, was a huge success. Bishop Theophilus Ajose, the Pentecostal Fellowship of Nigeria (PFN’s) Director of the Directorate of Politics and Governance (DPG), who spoke at the event, stressed the need for churches and ministries to come together and work as one at the community level to show Christian readiness to be involved in politics and change its productivity. -Advertisement- The ripples of this charge, he noted, would come to play at the forthcoming DPG event for Christian youths in Lagos State. Dr Akinyemi stressed: “The partnership for DPG is building seriously. Asides Redeemed Christian Church of God (RCCG), Four Square Gospel Church in Nigeria has also signed up for DPG and the department is now being created across all the branches of the church in Nigeria.” Akinyemi, who was awed by the results of DPG in such a short time, promised to get all the political movements and non-governmental organisation (NGOs) he is involved in to serve the interest of DPG on political education of her demography. He further said that Lagos must necessarily up the game and “lead the ‘exodus’ to our long desired new Nigeria.” He charged all General Overseers and churches alike to follow the example of Pastor E. A Adeboye, Rev Sam Aboyeji, RCCG and the Foursquare by setting up the DPG at all units of their churches. POLL “We all must be burdened with the need to create a new consciousness and build the right civic engagements and institutional accountability for Lagos through Lagosians!” he said. In another statement, Pastor Dr. Barnabas Otoibhi, State Deputy Director, DPGLAGOS, urged church leaders to release their youths to be a part of the Pentecostal Youths Leadership Summit, holding at The Abundant Life Bible Church, Iju Road, Agege, on Thursday, May 19, 2022, to mobilise Christian youths for voter registration towards the 2023 general elections.
