Seven times Nigerian champi­ons, Rangers International of Enugu, will be at home to Heart­land Football Club of Owerri in one of the week 27 rounds of games that will go down this weekend. The continental-chasing Flying Antelopes who are pres­ently fourth on the log with 42 points from 26 games will leave nothing to chance in order to get the maximum point and close the gap at the top as Rivers United are angling for the title and sit atop the table with 55 points from the same number of games. On the other hand, the Naze Millionaires of Owerri must not lose this fixture if they hope to continue the fight for a possi­ble survival this season. -Advertisement- The two-time CAF Cham­pions League finalists in 1988 and 2009 which have seen their good days waned recently are struggling for survival and are sitting poorly on the 18th spot on the log with 28 points from 26 games. A win in this match will take their tally to 29, which is even not enough to take them out of the drop zone. But giving their overall form, the hosts are highly favoured to get past their Oriental visitors. With two draws, two losses and a win in their last five games, Rangers are not very particu­larly impressive going into this fixture but their overall form which has seen them leap to the fourth spot gives them ad­vantage over Heartland. Heartland have lost once in their last five matches. They have won twice, drawn twice and with a loss, even as observ­ers believe that getting a point in Nnewi, the adopted home of Rangers, will be a huge boost in their fight against the drop. Meanwhile, if Rangers win this match and depending on what happens in the match between Remo Stars (on the third spot) and Abia Warriors in Umuahia, the Flying Ante­lopes could move to third.
