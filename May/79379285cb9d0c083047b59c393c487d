Lyon have beaten Barcelona 3-1 to lift the Women’s Champions League final. In a pulsating first half, Lyon opened the scoring through a spectacular effort from Amandine Henry. Ada Hegerberg headed in a second for Lyon, notching her 326th career goal in 210 appearances. -Advertisement- Catarina Macario added a third, before Alexia Putellas pulled one back for Barcelona. When the sides met in final in 2019, Lyon won 4-1 with Hegerberg scoring a hat-trick. It was a similar outcome on this affair as Lyon demonstrated their experience by controlling majority of the affair. In the second half, Lyon frustrated Barcelona and ensured the Spanish side were unable to get into their usual rhythm. Barcelona, who had only lost once this season, were unable to find a breakthrough but came closest when Patricia Guijarro saw Barcelona goalkeeper Christiane Endler off her and chipped it from 40 yards out. Her audacious effort, however, bounced off the woodwark. Lyon’s victory means they have now won a record eighth Champions League title, while Barcleona were unable to repeat their heroics of last season, where they dominated Chelsea 4-0.
