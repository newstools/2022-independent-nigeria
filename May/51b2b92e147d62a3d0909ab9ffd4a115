Gross earnings are also up by 18 per cent to N42.9 billion against N36.4 billion in Q1 2021. POLL “This was bolstered by improved asset yields, treasury trading income and revenues from our alternate channels. We are steadily seeing increasing customer adoption with a 36 per cent year-on-year (YoY) increase in active users on UnionDirect, our agency banking network, and increasing transaction volumes with a 20 per cent YoY growth across our digital channels. “Interest Income grew by 41 per cent from N22.2 billion to N31.4 billion as our earnings asset base expanded with a more viable loan portfolio. “Our NPL ratio is flat at 4.3 per cent (from December 2021), well within the regulatory limit, while cost to income ratio dropped from 79.4 per cent in December 2021 to 73.9 per cent in March 2022. We will continue to drive cost optimization to ensure consistent improvement in efficiencies. “With a Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR) of 15.6 per cent, our capital position remains strong. “On the innovation side, we launched SpaceNXT – a purpose-built hub created to encourage innovation and foster collaboration within the Nigerian tech ecosystem. This remains a space where Union Bank desires to maintain a leading position. “For the rest of H1 2022, we will continue to focus on driving productivity, mining targeted opportunities across regions and optimising our digital platforms to deliver improved customer service and acquisition.
