Hydro is back with a third single, but this time he is publishing under a new brand name; ‘Hydroheelz’. The song, written in Port Harcourt pidgin, is titled ‘Dey For You’ and was produced by afro-pop musician Beatboss. Originally named Uchenna Agu, Hydroheelz had recently recovered from a life-threatening health scare which interrupted his budding afro music career. “I legit thought I may not be able to make it. All those days and weeks I was in the hospital, I was just praying for God to heal me and help me recover. I missed the music, missed the studio sessions.” -Advertisement- He explained as he reminisced on his ordeal, adding; “When I started out with my debut single ‘Tire’, it was well received. My guys really liked that song. And so many people were just grooving to the beats. I posted some of them on my Instagram.” “It encouraged me a lot sha. I have always known what I am carrying, but the performance of that first song really made me happy. And then I put out my second song ‘My Turn’, not too long ago. So when this sickness came, I was really scared. But thank God I recovered. I feel like a new, reloaded individual, ready to go even bigger than my dreams”. In an interaction with fans of Hydroheelz, his manager, Jefferson Ibim averred that this new name simply captures the part of his story that is a testimony. It portrays what he chooses to remember from the ordeal; “the fact that he healed, not the fact that he was down” he said. POLL His testimony is also reflected in the song ‘Dey For you’, according to his Public Relations managers, Jabborro PR. In a statement obtained by journalists, they stated; “You can say this is a love song, the afro-pop way. Fans are going to love both the music and the lines of this particular single”.
