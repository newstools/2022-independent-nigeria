A South Carolina man died of a heart attack while burying a woman he allegedly strangled to death, authorities say. The Edgefield County Sheriff’s Office said in a news release that they were called to the Trenton home of Joseph McKinnon, 60, on 7 May for a report “of an unresponsive male lying in his yard”. When deputies arrived, they noticed that alongside McKinnon’s dead body was a shallow grave where they later uncovered a second dead person, 65-year-old Patricia Ruth Dent, who reportedly lived at the same address on Tanglewood Drive. -Advertisement- “Mr. McKinnon had no signs of trauma and natural causes were suspected,” Edgefield’s County Sheriff Jody Rowland and County Coroner David Burnett said. “While investigating the death and making notifications to the next of kin, a second body, was located in a freshly dug pit,” they said, at the time noting that they suspected she had “died by foul play”.
