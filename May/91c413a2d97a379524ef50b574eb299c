LAGOS – Comrade Gbenga Komolafe, a social activist, and General Secretary, Federation of Informal Workers’ Organisations of Nigeria (FIWON), has expressed the suggestion by the National Chairman of the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA), Major General Buba Marwa (rtd), that drug tests be carried out on all aspirants to political positions. Comrade Komolafe, Co-Convener, Coalition for Revolution (CORE), who spoke to Sunday INDEPENDENT on Saturday, described the call as a most useful suggestion by the NDLEA boss. The activist and trade unionist said it was a known secret that several incumbent officeholders and aspiring ones too had been hooked on hard drugs. -Advertisement- According to him, “We have seen leaders talk in public exhibiting the telltale signs; slurred speech, uncoordinated logic, bulging eyes, etc. “How can people hooked on drugs have a meaningful idea to offer? How can we trust them with the presence of mind, clarity of judgement, tenacity of purpose, some basic personal and organisational discipline, and the focus and commitment required to manage this country with her multifaceted challenges? “Besides, hard drugs cost fortunes. This fact also partly explains why there is so much corruption and kleptomania in our political space. My only fear is that even if the NDLEA suggestion is adopted by the powers-that-be, it might be a bit tough to get NDLEA to actually serve the purpose. “I’m not so sure that its operatives would not be compromised into given the chronic addicts a clean bill of health when some huge sums exchange hands. But, it’s a great idea if it could be carried through as it would help weed out a lot of junkies from our political space.”
