Nigerian actress, Nse Ikpe-Etim, has revealed why she stopped acting in movies for some years before returning to the Nollywood industry in Kemi Adetiba’s King of Boys: The Return of the King. According to the actress in an interview with media personality, Chude Jideonwo, she had a medical condition and wasn’t available for some acting jobs, however, after she recuperated movies roles stopped coming to her but she was at peace with it. She said, “If any actor says they haven’t been through that then I don’t envy them because the drought is also time for growth. You can’t waste any moments and I think if you’re prepared when the opportunity comes, if there was a drought, you’re ready. So there’s no moment that’s a drought for me. -Advertisement- “Yes they don’t come or yes they come and you’re not quite sure. But yes, I have had a drought, like massive drought, and this was during the period when I had a medical condition and I wasn’t available. And in life, no matter how you look at it, there are some things that are more important than other things. “And so it was family time and it was necessary to at least understand that what it is that I had gotten myself into because I didn’t get married because it was fashionable. You’re living with someone, you’ve got to learn yourselves. “It’s a thing, and if it’s a thing you’ve walked into, you’ve got to do what people do. Right? So it was during this period that I realized I had a health condition and I was going through so much in my head. “So even when things came, I was enthused. Then they stopped coming altogether and that too was fine. Because really, it didn’t matter to me. I was done, mentally.”
