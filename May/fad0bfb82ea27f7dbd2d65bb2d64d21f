The death toll of civilians in Ukraine has exceeded 3,000 people as of Monday, according to the UN’s human rights office (OHCHR). Since the start of the Russian invasion on 24 February, the OHCHR has recorded 3,153 civilian deaths in Ukraine – but it estimates the real toll is likely to be “considerably higher”. Possible discrepancies in the figures recorded come from the difficulty in receiving information from certain areas of the country and reports that are still pending corroboration. -Advertisement- This includes the lack of verification of large numbers of civilian casualties from places like the besieged port city of Mariupol. Mariupol has suffered relentless bombing since the start of the war, with the city council estimating about 80% to 90% of the city’s buildings have been damaged or destroyed. Satellites have also identified mass burial sites near Mariupol containing about 200 graves, which are likely used to bury civilian bodies. Local authorities have estimated vast numbers of civilians have been killed in the bombardment of the city. The UN believes most civilians across the country have been killed by explosive weapons with a wide impact area (such as missile and air strikes), but the report did not specify who was responsible for the casualties.
