A strike by owners of fuel tankers over the weekend renewed Sri Lanka’s long queues for diesel and petrol on Monday (May 2) as pumps ran dry, compounding the island nation’s economic and energy crisis. Sri Lanka is in the grip of a pandemic-spurred economic freefall, the worst since independence from Britain in 1948, which has led to shortages of food and other essentials. The lack of fuel has been an especially large sticking point for the government, as petrol prices have increased by 90 per cent while diesel – commonly used for public transport – has gone up by 138 per cent -Advertisement- Fuel woes eased slightly last week as supplies arrived under a US$500 million (S$691 million) credit line from India. But the salve proved temporary as fuel tanker operators have been on strike since late on Saturday (April 30), demanding an increase to their prices to ferry the petrol across the country. Energy minister Kanchana Wijesekera said on Monday he needed at least three more days to restore the supplies of petrol and diesel “I appeal to the motorists to bear with us for three more days,” he told reporters in Colombo, adding that the government was trying to hire other mobile container owners not affiliated with the protest
