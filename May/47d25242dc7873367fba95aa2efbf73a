A spokesperson for the company told Daily Independent in an interview in Lagos that its attention has been drawn to a certain facebook post made by a blogger named connectplus, whom the company alleged was hired by “its detractors and competitors to carry out an elaborate smear campaign against our brand by making false publications aimed at lowering the estimation of our law abiding company in the eyes of Nigerians”. AKT said it is a law-abiding company and has been operating in the Nigerian market space since 2007 lawfully and without issue. -Advertisement- Contrary to the allegations made in the post that it started operating in Nigerian in in the year 2014, it said Aokete Lighting Industry Ltd actually commenced business in Nigeria in 2007 after being duly registered with the Corporate Affairs Commission. The company stated it has never operated with any forged certificate either for trademark or any other area. It, however, admitted that sometime in March 2022, some people approached a Federal High Court sitting in Abuja, sought and obtained an ex-parte order in order to disturb its business, adding that as a law abiding company, it approached the same court with facts and relevant documents, sought and obtained an order of the court, which discharged the order on 27 April 2022. The spokesman said Justice Taiwo Taiwo made the order in suit no: fhc/abj/cs/56/2022. He added, “We wish to reiterate our refusal to join issues with anyone or entity; we are only by this disclaimer seeking to debunk the false publications made about our company, and to inform the general public of our continued commitment to adding value to Nigeria and it citizens. We also wish to state that the brand AKT and our products will continue to speak quality and brightness to every household in Nigeria.”
