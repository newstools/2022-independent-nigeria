Her guardian, Mrs. Adebimpe Ibrahim who spoke with Tribune Online said, “My daughter left home around 5 am on Thursday and since then, we have searched almost everywhere to locate her.

I am losing it already and I don’t know how much more I can take if she’s not found,” she added. One of her sisters who doesn’t want her name in print also expresses her worry about Arafat’s location adding, “she’s a cool and religious devotee, having to part with her this long is worrisome and we are hoping that she will reunite with us soon.”
