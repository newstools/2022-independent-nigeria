ABUJA – The President/CEO of Feder­al Housing Authority- KETTI Investment and Development Company and owner, Granite and Marble, High Chief Mo­ses Ayom, has appealed to President Muhammadu Bu­hari, President of the Senate and Speaker of the House of Representatives to intervene in the $1.2billion mining in­vestment crisis. Ayom, who made the ap­peal in a chat with newsmen, said that the intervention would “promote employment opportunities and wealth cre­ation.” Ayom’s Granite and Mar­ble signed a deal with China’s SBM in 2016, the same day the deal for the Dangote fertiliz­er plant was consummated, when the two business mo­guls accompanied Buhari to China for bilateral talks. -Advertisement- Senator Ibikunle Amosun and Governor Nasir El-Rufai were among the dignitaries on the delegation that wit­nessed the agreement.
