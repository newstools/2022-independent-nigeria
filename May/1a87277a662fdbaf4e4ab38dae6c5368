Chief Wole Olanipekun (SAN), the Chairman of the Body of Benchers (BoB), has described as unconstitutional, immoral and threat to the nation’s democracy the call by Robert Clarke (SAN) on President Muhammadu Buhari to extend his tenure on account of the nation’s security challenge. Olanipekun, who heads the highest body of law experts in Nigeria (BoB), argued in a statement on Wednesday in Abuja that no provision in the Constitution supports Clarke’s proposition, noting that the only situation where election could be shifted is when the nation is at war with a foreign country as provided in Section 135(3). The former President of the Nigerian Bar Association (NBA) contended that the current security challenge in the country could not be equated with war envisaged under Section 135(3) of the Constitution, urging Buhari to resist every temptation to stay in power at the expiration of his tenure. -Advertisement- Olanipekun, who wondered why Clarke, who condemned former President Olusegun Obasanjo’s bid for third term, would turn around to advise Buhari to engage in direct breach of the Constitution, said Buhari was not expected to deal with all the nation’s challenges before vacating office. He said: “I am afraid, I cannot agree with the postulations and prognosis of my learned friend of the Inner Bar (Clarke) as, same, with much respect to him, are not constitutional, legal, legitimate, moral, democratic, acceptable, reasonable, or in the best interest of Nigeria and Nigerians. “While it is glaring that Nigeria isbedeviledbya mountain of daunting challenges, including insecurity, this cannot be any justification for a call for PMB or any President, howsoever, to extend his tenure outside the constitutionally provided maximum period of eight years, as prescribed by the combined provisionsof Sections135(2) and 137(1)(b) of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, 1999 (as amended). “With further respect, the suggestion is a direct call to breach of the Constitution, as well as its spirit, tenor and letter. There is no gainsaying the fact that the end result of such a proposition would further compound the conundrum that we have stepped into and plunge us to a latent state of anomie. POLL “It is quite disturbing, unfortunate, uncheering, and very worrisome that since 1999, Nigeria has been migrating from one problem to another, oscillating from one crisis to another; graduating from one degree of catastrophe to another; as a result of which the landscape has become a practicing pitch for all sorts of theories, ideologies, ideas, suggestions, prognosis and hypothesis, thelastof which has just come from there spected Chief Robert Clarke, SAN.
