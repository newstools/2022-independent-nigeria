Tottenham have confirmed the summer capture of Ivan Perisic on a free transfer. Perisic worked under Spurs boss Antonio Conte during their time together with Inter and with his contract up with the Italian side, the north London outfit acted quickly to secure his services. “We are delighted to announce the transfer of Ivan Perisic,” a statement read on Tottenham’s official website. -Advertisement- “The vastly experienced Croatia international will join the Club on 1 July following the expiration of his contract at Internazionale and has agreed a deal that will run until 2024.” Perisic played a key role for Inter as they finished second in the 2021/22 Serie A campaign, with a WhoScored rating of 7.22 enough to make the team of the season. Spurs are set to make a big splash in the transfer market this summer, with the club also linked with Perisic’s former Inter teammate Alessandro Bastoni. The north London side are also monitoring Middlesbrough’s Djed Spence, who spent last season on loan with Nottingham Forest, as Conte revamps the squad with the backing from the board.
