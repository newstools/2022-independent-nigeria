The Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Godwin Emefiele on Monday filed a suit before a Federal High Court in Abuja over the alleged plan to disqualify him from the All Progressives Congress (APC) presidential primaries slated for May ending. Daily Independent had on Friday reported how some groups purchased N100 million nomination and expression of interest forms for Emefiele. The move, however, triggered outrage as many called on the CBN governor to step down. Reacting swiftly to the announcement, Emefiele declined the presidential forms bought for him, saying he would use his resources to purchase them if he is interested in the race. -Advertisement- Meanwhile, the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has given political parties a deadline of June 3 to submit their candidates for the 2023 elections. But in documents sighted by our correspondent, Emefiele, through his lawyer, Mike Ozekhome, argued that he is not a political appointee and by provision of the constitution, he is expected to resign a month before the February 25, 2023, presidential election. “It is our respectful submission that the plaintiff is not a political appointee as envisaged by the Electoral Act and as he seeks to contest for the Office of the President in the new electoral calendar, he shall only be governed or guided by the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, (1999), as amended, which requires that he gives at least thirty (30) days’ notice of resignation, withdrawal or retirement from the office of the Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria before any elections,” the document read. He also contended that a Federal High Court in Umuahia, Abia State, had  nullified section 12 (8) of the Electoral Act. It was gathered that INEC and the Office of the Attorney-General of the Federation (AGF) were joined in the suit.
