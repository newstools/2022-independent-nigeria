LAGOS – As part of efforts of the Nobel Laureate, Professor Wole Soyinka to expand the frontiers of knowledge, a giant step was taken on Tuesday as he signs a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) ceding the custody of the popular Ijegba Forestage to the Federal University of Agriculture, Abeokuta (FUNAAB). The Ijegba Forestage, comprising several hectares of land areas, housing residence, library, and writers’ retreat residency is to be managed by the University to promote academic, cultural, ecological, and recreational studies leading to the deepening of multicultural studies that can strengthen the integration of science and humanities. At the low-key signing ceremony held at the Ijegba Forestage, Professor Wole Soyinka who is an Honorary Doctorate Degree Awardee of the FUNAAB expressed his broad views on how the entire space should be put into proper use now and even after his exit. -Advertisement- He expressed the conviction on the need to run the place as an autonomous body that is dedicated to the promotion of knowledge of science and humanities and bringing together researchers all over the world to use the facilities in their natural form, irrespective of discipline. Responding,the Vice-Chancellor, Professor Felix Kolawole Salako expressed appreciation to the Nobel Laureate assuring that the University will make the best use of the gesture of the donor using his ideals as a guide.
