The Attorney General of the Federation (AGF) and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami, SAN has said that his recent withdrawal from the Kebbi State governorship race was borne out of patriotism and deserves to be commended by Nigerians. Malami, who spoke through his spokesperson, Dr Umar Gwandu maintained that he did not violate any law by the action because it was his individual right to choose to voluntarily shelve his political ambition. In a statement issued on Saturday, Gwandu said that Malami did not resign as AGF despite attending the valedictory ceremony hosted by President Muhammadu Buhari, adding that it is a matter of personal conviction and individual rights which didn’t violate any law. -Advertisement- He stated further that right-thinking members of the society accord respect to individuals’ right to freedom of choice in matters relating to this. It could be recalled that the AGF had on April 28 revealed his intention to run for governor of Kebbi State at a stakeholder meeting in Birnin Kebbi. But in view of the litigations and controversy arising from Section 84 (12 )of the Electoral Act, 2022, which bars political appointees from voting or being voted for, President Muhammadu Buhari took a stand on May 11, directing all his cabinet members with political ambitions to resign and pursue their desires. He said, “As individual Nigerian citizens with inalienable fundamental rights, we are not aware of any legally justifiable and reasonable tenable obligations compelling the person of Abubakar Malami or as an AGF to do otherwise. “The decision is not only a demonstration of altruism and patriotism but of contentment, self-control, placidity and decisiveness in problem-solving at a time shrouded with confusing and competing for stimulus. It is a commendable posture worthy of admiration coming from a paragon of virtue.”
