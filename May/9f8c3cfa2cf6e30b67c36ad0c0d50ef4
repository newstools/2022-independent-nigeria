ABAKALIKI – A frontline Presidential Aspirant on the Platform of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Governor David Umahi is set to appear before the high-powered APC Presidential Screening Committee in Abuja on Saturday. A statement by his Special Adviser on Media and Publicity, Mr Francis Nwaze, said Umahi “would be presenting before the screening committee his glamorous credentials that qualify him to vie for the number one position in the Country.” Umahi who is adjudged to have performed excellently well as Governor of Ebonyi State, according to his Spokesman, is also expected to use the opportunity the screening affords, to inform the Committee members, the APC members, and Nigerians in general, how he would replicate his magical transformation of Ebonyi State across the Federation if elected President in 2023. -Advertisement- Part of the statement reads, “You would recall that His Excellency, Engineer David Nweze Umahi within seven years onboard as the Governor of Ebonyi State has been able to turn around the face of Abakaliki and virtually all the 13 Local Government Areas of the State. “Within the period under review, the Governor has built over seventeen long span-twin flyovers in parts of the State, constructed thousands of kilometers of roads in 8-inches concrete pavement, constructed from the scratch the newly commissioned King David University of Medical Sciences Uburu, the biggest international shopping mall, the Christian Ecumenical Centre Abakaliki and the Margaret Umahi International Market. “Other legacy projects executed by the Governor Umahi administration in Ebonyi State include: the Industrial Clusters, one in each of the three Senatorial Zones of the State, the School of Nursing and Midwifery Uburu, the ongoing construction of the Ebonyi State International Airport, the newly commissioned biggest Executive Council Chambers, the new Government House complex as well as the ongoing construction of the 199 kilometers of the Abakaliki Ring Road Project.” The statement further expressed hope that Umahi would not only pass the screening exercise, but would win APC primary election as well as the 2023 presidential election. “It is hoped that Governor Umahi would scale through the first hurdle of screening, and win the Primaries and the general elections to enable him to bring to bear his engineering prowess in tackling Nigeria’s myriads of challenges”, the statement added.
