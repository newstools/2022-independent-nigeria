LAGOS – Manchester City produced a great comeback to win the 2021/2022 En­glish Premier League season. The Citizens, who were the fa­vourites to beat Aston Villa on the last day on Sunday were surprisingly pegged as they found themselves behind ear­ly in the first half after Matty Cash scored for the visitors in the 37th minute at the Etihad. Despite pressure, the first half failed to produce any other goal but in the second half, Phil­lippe Coutinho got the better of the Citizens to increase the lead for Villa in the 69th minute. But three goals in a space of five minutes meant that The Citizens captured the league title, which they were the fa­vourites heading into the final day of the season, as Liverpool waited in the wing for a slip from the front runners. -Advertisement- The host knew a win on the final day of the season would guarantee the title and, despite going 2-0 down, it scored three goals in five second half min­utes to send the Etihad Stadium into delirium. Fans, many of which had their heads in their hands for much of the game, exploded into song as City players fell to their knees after winning a title race like no other. Pep Guardiola’s team have been pushed to the end by Liv­erpool but come into the final day of the campaign with the destination of the trophy firm­ly in their hands but last week­end’s 2-2 draw at West Ham meant they have no margin for error. They now claim their fourth title in the past five sea­sons despite a Liverpool win at Wolves. Villans manager Steven Ger­rard was out to spoil the party at the Etihad, trying to aid Liv­erpool, a team he captained as a player for many years in the process, and said in the build-up to the game: “If that inevitably helps Liverpool, fantastic, but my priority is to try and get points for Aston Villa.”
