One of the political parties in Nigeria, the National Rescue Movement (NRM) has assured that it would give youths who wish to contest various positions a priority and a platform for them to emerge as winners during the 2023 general elections. Amb. Isaac Chidozie Udeh, National Chairman of NRM, stated this in an interview with newsmen in Abuja. He assured that his party would give chance to the youths to vie for various elective positions, including the presidency in order to turn around the fortunes of the Nigerian economy. -Advertisement- Udeh pointed out that with young people in leadership positions, there would be the entrenchment of good governance and the creation of a brighter future for every Nigerian. He also appealed to the judiciary to live up to the expectation by ensuring justice and fair play in the delivery of judgement, adding that the judgement of the Supreme Court on the Imo State governorship election has thrown the state into unrest and chaos since the emergence of Hope Uzodinma as the governor. He added that unknown gunmen have continued to unleash terror on the residents of the state, because of what he described as a travesty of justice. On the current state of the Nigerian economy, the National Chairman of NRM described it as being in bad shape and “a complete write-off.”
