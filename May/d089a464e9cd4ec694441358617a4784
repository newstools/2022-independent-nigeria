Governor Abdullahi Umar Ganduje of Kano State has pardoned 90 inmates across Kano Correctional Centres, as a mark of Sallah celebration. He asked them to report to the government and register for skills acquisition programmes, assuring that more inmates would be pardoned “…in the next 70 days during Eid-Kabir celebration.” This was made known when he paid a Sallah visit to Goron Dutse Correctional Centre, Kano, Monday, along with some members of the state Executive Council, party leaders and elders, among other government dignitaries. -Advertisement- “Some of you have been pardoned because of ill-health, some because of age, some because of their inability to pay fines placed on them and some were even on death row,” he explained. Adding that, “Though many of you were given training in one skill or the other, those of you who need further training should immediately go and register with the government for another round of skills acquisition.” Governor Ganduje reminded them that the pardon was not only meant to decongest Correctional Centres, but to also give them another chance to be of good character.by
