The National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) has disclosed that the three-storey building which collapsed on Ibadan Street, in the Ebute Metta, Lagos State on Sunday night, was already marked for demolition. NEMA’s acting coordinator, Ibrahim Farinloye, disclosed this while confirming the death of five persons, stating that there is another three-storey building close to the current collapsed building on Ibadan Street, which has been marked as distressed but the occupants are being deviant. Farinloye said, “Another three-storey building, on Lagos Street, about 200 metres away from the current scene has shown signs of distress with part throwing pebbles and falling off. “The building had also been marked as distressed but the occupants were deviant. However, the building has been re-sealed and occupants evacuated by officers of Lagos State Buildings Control Agency.” A search and rescue operation is ongoing by NEMA, Lagos State Emergency Management Agency, Lagos State Fire and Rescue Services, and others, as 23 persons including children have been rescued alive. However, the number of people trapped is still uncertain.
