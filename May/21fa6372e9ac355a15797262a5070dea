In furtherance of its resolve to rid the city of all forms of environmental hazards and ensure Citizens live in a clean, serene and pollution-free environment, the Lagos State Taskforce in collaboration with the Ministry of the Environment carried out a cleanup exercise of the refuse hill located at Olusosun in Ojota axis of the State. The activity which lasted for several hours was spearheaded by the Chairman of the Lagos State Taskforce, CSP Shola Jejeloye who stated that the cleanup action was necessary considering the health and environmental hazards posed by the dumpsite to Lagosians transiting or residing within the area. Jejeloye further stated that the dumpsite has been a known haven for criminal elements who engage in many forms of criminal activities including traffic robbery. “We have carried out raids on this dumpsite in the past and made arrests of suspects with dangerous weapons mostly used for robbery in traffic. Clearing up the site now will definitely reduce the incidents of traffic robbery and pickpocketing around here”. -Advertisement- A total number of 9 suspected traffic robbers with dangerous weapons used to intimidate victims were arrested during their operations. CSP Jejeloye hinted that the exercise which kicked off over the weekend would be continuous and thorough in order to ensure that cleanliness and hygiene are achieved and maintained on and off the dumpsite. He urged Lagosians to ensure that their wastes are disposed of properly in designated waste bins and not littered across the street which could eventually block the water drainages in the State and eventually lead to flooding. “Environmental offenders who engage in activities that pollute the environment will be arrested and prosecuted to serve as a deterrent to others. All hands must be on deck to ensure that Lagos State is clean, serene and habitable for all” He concluded.
