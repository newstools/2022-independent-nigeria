Former vice president of Nigeria, Atiku Abubakar, has flayed the current administration of the All Progressives Congress-led by President Muhammadu Buhari for championing religion and ethnicity in his appointment of persons into various positions in the country. Atiku, who expressed his displeasure when he met with Edo state national delegates in Benin City, preached unity, saying he would restore and proffer solutions to other problems confronting the country. “Today, if you are not from a certain part of the country or religious faith, nobody looks at your face. This is criminal. I have what it takes to unify this country and I humbly submit to do it,” he pledged. -Advertisement- The presidential aspirant on the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party said “I want to assure you that PDP will lift Nigeria from bottom to top. Our PDP Administration establishes institutions. “We imposed an education trust fund to distribute money to the states and local governments, but this government has plundered the money to the extent that our universities have been on strike for many months without earning salaries. “PDP has done an excellent job in Nigeria. I was involved in the achievements of PDP because I was the chairman of the economic council of our administration. I used the best economists; I didn’t look at their ethnicity or religion. I was only after their talents to better Nigerians. He said the All Progressives Congress is not an option for the 2023 presidential election due to the current problem challenging the country under the party’s watch. On his part, Tony Aziegbemi, state chairman of the party, urged delegates to give their votes to Atiku Abubakar.
