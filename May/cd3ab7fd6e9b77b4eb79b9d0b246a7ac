Chelsea manager Thomas Tuchel wants to sign Paris Saint-Germain’s Presnel Kimpembe ahead of Sevilla’s Jules Kounde as he looks to bolster his defence for next season. The Blues are looking for defensive reinforcements this summer, with Antonio Rudiger and Andreas Christensen both set to leave the club to join Real Madrid and Barcelona respectively. Chelsea’s top target was believed to be Kounde, with the club having tried to sign the Frenchman last summer before talks collapsed with Sevilla. -Advertisement- However, according to Sky Sports, Tuchel would prefer to bring in Kimpembe over Kounde, who he has worked with previously at PSG. The report goes on to say that Atletico Madrid’s Jose Gimenez and RB Leipzig’s Josko Gvardiol are also under consideration. Tuchel and Kimpembe enjoyed a fruitful spell together at PSG, when the German was manager of the Ligue 1 side between 2018 and 2020. The duo won two league titles together and finished runner-up in the Champions League in 2020. When Tuchel left the Parc des Princes 18 months ago, Kimpembe was disappointed to see the 46-year-old leave. POLL He said, via Twitter: ‘Thank you coach for these years. Thank you to you and your team for your high standards, your trust, your enormous work, which allowed us to win many trophies together. I wish you the best for your next adventures.’ In recent seasons, Kimpembe has become a mainstay in PSG’s defence, making over 200 appearances for the French giants. In eight years at PSG, he has won five Ligue 1 titles and four French cups including three double triumphs. Meanwhile, he has made 26 appearances for the French national team and was part of the winning World Cup side of 2018.
