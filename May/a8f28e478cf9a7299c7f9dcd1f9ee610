Christian Aburime, the Chief Press Secretary to Anambra State Governor Chukwuma Soludo, has debunked the reports of the governor meeting with the cloned version of the leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), Nnamdi Kanu. Recall that last Friday, the governor visited Kanu at the Department of State Services’ detention facility in Abuja. According to Aburime ]while speaking to The Punch on Saturday, the reports of the IPOB leader being a clone is a product of propaganda. -Advertisement- He said, “The people saying Soludo posted the video of a cloned Kanu are telling lies to deceive the people and the truth is obvious. Do you think a governor will want to get involved in that kind of frivolities by coming to tell the people that he met Kanu if he did not meet him? “In essence, Soludo met with Kanu and not a cloned fellow of him. Everything is clear enough, you can see the governor and Kanu in the videos clearly, it was not something that is cloned as people are erroneously propagating now. “On the reason he was wearing a red dress instead of the traditional white cloth that he wears to court is because the judge has directed that the DSS allows him access to any cloth he wants to wear and even allow him to watch television. So, on the day Soludo visited him, he was wearing a different cloth, people should not expect him to wear one type of cloth every day. “He has the right to wear any type of cloth he wants to wear, especially as the judge has directed the DSS to allow him to change clothes.”
