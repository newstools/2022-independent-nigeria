Lagos – Nigerian basketball has been eclipsed by darkness following the federal government approved withdrawal of the sport from international competition for two years. The government action is premised on the orchestrated crisis by some personalities in the presidency who feel threatened with the re-election of Musa Ahmed Kida as president of the Nigeria Basketball Federation (NBBF). The government, while announcing this improperly thought out decision, said that the decision was as a result of the “unending crisis that has plagued and nearly crippled basketball development in the country.” -Advertisement- According to the statement, “President Muhammadu Buhari has today (Thursday) approved the immediate withdrawal of Nigeria from all International Basketball Competitions for a period of two years.” The statement signed by the Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Youth and Sports Development, Alhaji Ismaila Abubakar, added that the withdrawal would afford the country the opportunity of revamping the sport from the grassroots as well as reviving the domestic leagues, which have become moribund. The government intends to set up an Interim Management Committee that will administer the sport and address other related issues bordering on the development of the sport. “Government intends to utilize this period of break to address all contentious issues among stakeholders. The Terms of Reference (TOR) and membership of the Interim Management Committee will be announced in due course”, the statement added. POLL The government reiterated its interest and commitment to the development of the sport and also the huge talents abound domestically, stating that it wants all these to happen in an atmosphere that is free of rancour and squabbles. The government called on players, officials, fans, and other stakeholders to remain calm as it embarks on far-reaching initiatives to reposition, sustain and stabilize the sport for growth and success in the longterm.
