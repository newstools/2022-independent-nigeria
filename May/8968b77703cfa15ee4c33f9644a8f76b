ADO-EKITI  – Some leaders of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) es­caped being lynched in Erinyin­yan-Ekiti in an alleged attempt to endorse a particular candi­date for the Ekiti Assembly slot. Daily Independent learnt that among those who survived the onslaught were former Ekiti APC State Chairman, Jide Awe, Chairman of the Ekiti-West Lo­cal Government, Sedan Okere and former Deputy Speaker, Ek­iti House of Assembly, Gbenga Odebunmi. Others were former Chair­man of Ekiti-West Local Gov­ernment, Akin Oluwadare, among others. -Advertisement- They were ambushed at a meeting to fine-tune the affir­mation of the second-term bid of a member of the State House of Assembly, Tajudeen Aking­bolu. Akingbolu had alleged that the thugs were being prodded by one of the contestants for the Assembly seat and former council chairman, who was said to be aggrieved over the endorsement. Recounting how the attack happened, Akingbolu, currently representing Ekiti-West Constit­uency 1 in the Assembly, said the meeting, which started at 10am was orderly and hitch-free until 10.30am, when Akin Oluwadare read the communique issued by the elders.
