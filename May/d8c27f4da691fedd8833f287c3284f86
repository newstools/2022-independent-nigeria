WARRI – A chieftain of the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) in Delta State, Mike Okeme, has lauded the prevalent peace in the state, which he described as the most im­portant factor that makes democracy thrive in the society. According to him, any na­tion that wants to grow in all aspects should embrace peace as a pre-requisite to fast track peace and harmony. Okeme, a former Special Adviser to Governor Ifeanyi Okowa on Labour and Ser­vicom Matters, stated this shortly after addressing campaign flow members in Asaba. -Advertisement- He said all hands must be on deck to ensure the success of PDP in all general elections in the state. He told all the campaign flow members spread across the 25 local government areas of the state, that the political pressure group will give over­whelming support to whoever emerges as the PDP governor­ship candidate in 2023 general elections. “We believe in ourselves; we equally believe that PDP, the leading political party in the state and across the country will not be a loser in any election,” insisting that the party will not play second fiddle during the exercise.
