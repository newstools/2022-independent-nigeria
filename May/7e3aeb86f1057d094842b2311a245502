Zlatan Ibrahimovic will be out for up to eight months after undergoing surgery on his left knee. The 40-year-old striker has had an injury-hit season but helped AC Milan win Serie A, scoring eight goals in 30 appearances across all competitions. He did, however, miss a significant chunk of the season between late January and early March amid Achilles problems. The Swede struggled with a ligament issue during 2017, when he played for Manchester United. -Advertisement- Ibrahimovic’s contract with Milan ends this summer. A statement from Milan read: “AC Milan announces that Zlatan Ibrahimovic underwent an operation on his left knee carried out by Dr Bertrand Sonnery-Cottet, with the Club’s Medical Director Stefano Mazzoni in attendance, at the Hôpital Jean Mermoz in Lyon. “The arthroscopy had been planned for a while to definitively resolve the joint’s instability through the reconstruction of the anterior cruciate ligament, with lateral reinforcement and meniscus reparation. “The operation was a complete success and the prognosis is estimated between 7 and 8 months.”
