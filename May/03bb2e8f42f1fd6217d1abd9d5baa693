The Deputy Speaker of the Kano State House of Assembly, Zubairu Hamza Massu, has dumped the ruling All Progressive Congress (APC). With his resignation, the APC lost four House of Assembly members within three days. The party has been hit by a wave of defections since Governor Abdullahi Umar Ganduje anointed Nasiru Gawuna, his deputy, to succeed him. -Advertisement- Members of the APC from Kano South are reportedly not happy with the endorsement of Gawuna and Murtala Garo, from Kano central and Kano north, in the 2023 elections. The deputy speaker, who is representing Sumaila Local Government from Kano South in the assembly, announced his resignation from the APC in a letter addressed to the ward chairman of the APC, Massu town. Although he did not reveal his next move, Massu said the decision came after a series of consultations with his constituents and supporters about the recent happenings in their party. “Following the recent happening in the party couple with series of consultations with my constituents, supporters and stakeholders in Sumaila and Kano North in general, I write to notify you of my intention and decision to resign as a member of APC. “The decision is mainly due to unjust treatment, inadequate internal democracy and total marginalization of Kano south from a lot of opportunities,” the letter read.
