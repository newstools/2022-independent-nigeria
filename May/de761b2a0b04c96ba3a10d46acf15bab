There are multiple reports in Italy that Juventus directors will meet Paul Pogba’s representatives on Monday to discuss a return as a free agent from Manchester United. The midfielder is out of contract from July 1 and seems to have no intention whatsoever of signing a new deal to remain at Old Trafford. While there have been consistent reports of a Juve comeback, Sky Sport Italia, Goal.com and Sportitalia now all claim a meeting has been set up for Monday May 16. -Advertisement- With the death of agent Mino Raiola, it is now Rafaela Pimenta who will deal with Pogba’s situation going forward. Pimenta is expected to be in Turin on Monday to discuss the situation with Juventus directors and analyse the proposal on the table. Sportitalia maintain Juve can only offer €7-8m per season wages, which is considerably less than Real Madrid and Paris Saint-Germain could provide. However, the Bianconeri hope Pogba will follow his heart and return to the club where he was happiest, playing between 2012 and 2016 before his €105m sale to Manchester United. Some of that was under coach Max Allegri, who has also returned to Juventus after two years away.
