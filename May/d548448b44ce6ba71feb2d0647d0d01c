Former President Goodluck Ebele Jonathan has denied his rumoured defection to the All Progressives Congress (APC) and purchase of Nomination and Expression of Interest Forms on the APC platform. He however added that the Presidential nomination form was purchased for him by some northern group of herders and Almajiris who put resources together to buy the form in his name out of love for his person and performance as president. A statement by Ikechukwu Eze, media adviser to the former president indicates that he did not authorize the purchase of the forms for him and that should he make up his mind to run, he will make it public. -Advertisement- The statement read, ‘’It has come to our notice that a group has purportedly purchased Presidential Nomination and Expression of Interest forms, of the All Progressives Congress APC, in the name of former President Dr Goodluck Ebele Jonathan. We wish to categorically state that Dr Jonathan was not aware of this bid and did not authorize it. ‘’We want to state that if the former President wanted to contest an election, he would make his intentions clear to the public and would not enter through the back door. ‘’While we appreciate the overwhelming request by a cross-section of Nigerians, for Dr Jonathan to make himself available for the 2023 Presidential election, we wish to state that he has not in any way, committed himself to this request. “Buying a presidential aspiration form in the name Dr Jonathan without his consent, knowing the position he had held in this country, is considered an insult to his person. The general public is therefore advised to disregard it’’, the statement added.
