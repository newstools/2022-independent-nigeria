In the wake of incessant killings and Kidnappings of innocent citizens across the country, the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) has called on President Muhammadu Buhari-led All Progressives Congress (APC) to be accountable for fixing Nigeria’s insecurity. The opposition party made the call while celebrating with Nigerians, especially the Muslim Ummah on Eid el-Fitr which marked the successful completion of the month-long Ramadan fast. Lamenting the myriad of problems bedevilling the country, PDP in a statement issued by its National Publicity Secretary, Hon. Debo Ologunagba said it was worried that many faithful could not travel for fear of being kidnapped. -Advertisement- The party, however, urged Nigerians to use the occasion to “strengthen the bond of unity and rekindle the virtues of love, faith in God, forgiveness, patience, tolerance, humility, compassion, care for one another, as well as our commitment to the survival and development of our dear nation.” The statement partly read, “Our party is deeply saddened that millions of Nigerian families are observing the Eid el-Fitr in despondency, anguish, sorrow and misery due to poverty and economic hardship foisted on them by the misrule of the APC. “It is also distressing that most Nigerians could not travel as they did in the past to celebrate with their loved ones due to insecurity, as the APC government continues to keep mute, turn blind eyes and refuse to confront terrorists who are daily ravaging our compatriots in communities, highways, railways and even worship places. “The PDP, in very strong terms, tasks President Muhammadu Buhari on the divisiveness, corruption, arrogance in failure, recklessness, impunity, lack of transparency, violation of rules and lethargic approach of his administration which are responsible for the social, economic and security quandary in our nation under the APC administration.”
