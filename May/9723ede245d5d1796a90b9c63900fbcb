Burnley are close to appointing Vincent Kompany as their manager. The former Manchester City captain is poised to leave his job as Anderlecht’s head coach to accept the challenge of trying to lead Burnley out of the Championship. Kompany has been in charge of Anderlecht since August 2020, although he started the previous season as player-manager before choosing to concentre on playing. The club finished third this season and a parting of ways suits both parties. Taking over at Burnley would return Kompany and his family to familiar part of England. His wife is from Manchester and their three children were born there. Kompany played for City from 2008-19. -Advertisement- Burnley were relegated last week and face the likely loss of several players and the need to reconfigure finances to be sustainable. Mike Jackson oversaw the final matches of the season after Sean Dyche was sacked but an upturn in form was not enough to prevent the club from finishing 18th. Burnley last played in the second tier in 2016, when they won the title, having finished second to win promotion two years earlier.
