Former Governor of Jigawa State, Sule Lamido, has warned former President Goodluck Jonathan against leaving the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) for the All Progressives Congress (APC). Lamido disclosed this to Vanguard, describing Jonathan as a greedy person for wanting to defect to APC, expressing that God’s wrath will fall upon him if he does. He said, “That means all they went through, the pain, the humiliation, for supporting Jonathan in 2014 was nothing. Even Jega (then-INEC Chairman) was not left out. We went through hell in 2014, all for Jonathan. He called me during the election in Jigawa. I said “sir”, he said “I hope you are safe”. I said “don’t worry sir. We are home and dry”. He said “thank God”. “I knew the kind of humiliation he went through. How he lost the election through blackmail, threat, and division between tribes and Christians and Muslims. I met him in the Presidential Villa four days after Buhari won the (2014) election. “What I told him in the Villa is for another day. I won’t say that now. He should remember what I told him. He should take all this into consideration. Is this the way he wants to reward PDP? Is this way he is going to reward PDP for inventing him? Minus PDP, who will ever know anybody called Jonathan? Today, he is an international person, being called upon by the world to perform functions for the world. “How did he get that kind of status? It is from PDP. Now, he is said to be going to APC because of greed, to destroy all this history of his? God will not allow him. If he goes, God will defend PDP. “If he goes, he will meet the wrath of God. I urge him not to do it. The people courting him now are liars. They lied to get to the government. I urge him in the name of God, the very God that made him from nothing, to think about PDP which made him from nothing. He should please reconsider.”
