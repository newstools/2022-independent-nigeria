Christian Eriksen might play his last game for Brentford this weekend, when they host relegation-threatened Leeds United in the final game of the season. The former Tottenham midfielder has relaunched his career in west London, and he’s been brilliant on his return to football after suffering a cardiac arrest last year during Euro 2020. His presence at Brentford has transformed the club’s fortunes, helping them to safely avoid any lingering thoughts of relegation and even challenging for a top half finish in the Premier League. -Advertisement- His blistering form has seen a host of clubs showing interest in his service, including former club Tottenham, who are now managed by the man who took him to Italy, Antonio Conte. The midfielder himself has recently said he would love to have a go at Champions League football again. But fellow Dane Frank is optimistic the midfielder will have a change of mind, and said there is a huge chance Eriksen will still be at the club next season. The Brentford manager said: “I would love to say 100%, but I am convinced there is a good chance he can wear the Brentford shirt [next season]. “I know I am optimistic but I also picked up the phone and said: ‘Hey do you want to come to Brentford?’ POLL “No one thought about that six months ago. I am convinced we will have a chance. “The way I will see it for us is that it is a win-win. He helped the team, he gave something to the fans they had never seen before at this level. We helped him back to his football life again. “For Christian, it is a win-win. Either he signs with us and everyone is going to be happy and the fans will build a statue of him outside the stadium in two or three years’ time, or he goes to a bigger level and fans will applaud him and we will all say: ‘Thank you for this time, go forward.’”The Bees will hope to end on a high, even if that could be the win that relegates Leeds United on Sunday afternoon at the Brentford Community Stadium.
