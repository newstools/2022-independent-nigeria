DAMATURU – All Progressives Congress (APC) Chieftain and elder statesman in Yobe State, Barrister Bakura Ba’aba has advised the party to ensure transparency and fairness in fielding the candidate for the forthcoming 2023 general elections. He stated during an interview with SATURDAY INDEPENDENT at his residence in Potiskum town. According to him, “There are no primaries going on in Yobe State, is just pick and choose depending on what the government wants. This is not healthy for democracy, I have been in this business for over 40 years and I’m one of those that actually enjoy the game of politics. -Advertisement- “I am not living in it for money nor am I living in it for the position. I could have got both but my position is that I want to be in a situation whereby I will get my Zone ‘B’ is organized. “I have a deep feeling that if Zone ‘B’ is organized, the state will move on but if we keep destabilizing Zone’B’ for whatever purpose, then we are not assisting Yobe State at all”. He further advised that “and that it is important for the government to look at what it is doing whether it is healthy for democracy because the way things are going when you impose candidate, two things will happen; you’re breaking your party yourself because some people who are uncomfortable with the candidate you have brought will not vote for him or they’ll vote against them or you will push out some who have strong views about democracy out of the party and that is unhealthy”. “I thought we should be moving forward but it looks like we’re moving backwards, so I advise that the government should be careful about what is happening”. Ba’aba added that “some people realized that the government always want praises, so if anybody thinks APC is waxing stronger is making a big mistake from bottom to the top, they should be corrected before it becomes too late, I don’t want the party to explode”.
