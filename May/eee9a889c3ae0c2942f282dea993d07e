The Chairman of the opposition People’s Democratic Party (PDP) Board of Trustees, (BoT), Chief Walid Jibrin on Monday revealed why the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) sabotaged its presidential candidate, Alhaji Atiku Abubakar in the 2019 general elections. The BoT Chairman while calling for unity among the party faithful in a statement issued in Abuja claimed that it was the sabotage that paved the way for President Muhammadu Buhari to emerge as ‘winner’ in the presidential contest. Appealing to party members to close ranks and support the party’s presidential standard-bearer for the 2023 general elections as the party moves to rescue Nigeria, he said, “We must remember that Atiku was in 2019 elected at the PDP presidential primary in Port-Harcourt, but was nakedly sabotaged by APC. -Advertisement- He, however, described the election of Atiku as the presidential candidate of the party a as “big success” not only for the PDP but for Nigerians and Nigerians. According to him, the former Vice President’s victory at the PDP convention has presented Nigerians with an opportunity to install a government for all. Jibrin told Nigerians to remember “the good performance” of Atiku as ex-President Olusegun Obasanjo’s deputy. The PDP leader insists the flagbearer is the best man to lead the country because “he’s not a tribalist”. Jibrin further hailed the delegates, and party members and urged them to work for a successful outing next year.
