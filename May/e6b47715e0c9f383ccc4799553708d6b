Transport For London (TfL) has today confirmed that the Elizabeth line will open on Tuesday 24 May 2022, subject to final safety approvals. The Elizabeth line is said to transform travel across London and the South East by improving transport links, cutting journey times, providing additional capacity, and transforming accessibility with spacious new stations and walk-through trains. It will initially operate as three separate railways, with services from Reading, Heathrow, and Shenfield connecting with the central tunnels from autumn this year. -Advertisement- 12 trains will operate per hour between Paddington and Abbey Wood from Monday to Saturday 6.30 am to 11 pm, while work will continue during engineering hours and on Sundays to allow for testing and software updates for more intensive services from autumn. All services between Reading and Heathrow to Paddington and Shenfield to Liverpool Street, currently operating as TfL Rail, will be rebranded to the Elizabeth line. Customers traveling between Reading or Heathrow into London will need to change at Paddington for services into the central section of the route, and customers from Shenfield into London will need to change at Liverpool Street. Services from Reading, Heathrow, and Shenfield will connect with the central tunnels in autumn when frequencies will also be increased to 22 trains per hour in the peak between Paddington and Whitechapel.
