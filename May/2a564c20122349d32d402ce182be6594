Governor Adegboyega Oye­tola of Osun state has said he is not ready to engage in “fire for fire politics ” already declared by some politicians ahead of the forthcoming July 16 governorship election in the state. Oyetola said that the des­peration of some politicians in their campaign to engage in do-or-die politics was not in his character. He cautioned that decency should be the watchword in political space rather than the use of inciting words that can lead to unrest. -Advertisement- The governor said this during an engagement pro­gramme with members of the Osun Chapter of the Young Farmers Association of Nigeria on Sunday in Osogbo. Represented by his Spe­cial Adviser on Civic En­gagement, Mr. Olatunbosun Oyintiloye, the governor said that he would rather engage in issue-based discussions regarding his achievements and prospects ahead, and will not involve in the campaign of calumny. Oyetola further said that the continuation of the var­ious developmental projects he had embarked on since the inception of his adminis­tration was the reason for his re-election campaign. He also opined that only those who lacked basic knowledge of governance would always see the election as a thug of war. Oyetola, however, ex­pressed optimism to win the election, and called for a free and fair poll. POLL Oyetola, who noted that his achievements in all sectors of the state economy would speak for him and ensure his re-election, stressed that the masses were also behind him. The governor said as part of his commitment to youth engagement his administra­tion has started a process of enrolling 30,000 vulnerable youths into the Health Insur­ance Scheme(OHIS).
