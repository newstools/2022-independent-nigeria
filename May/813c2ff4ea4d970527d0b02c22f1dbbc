An hour after sorting out votes for the Gombe South Senatorial primary election of the All Progressive Congress (APC) held on Saturday, tension has continued to envelop the venue of the election at Government Lodge Billiri.

Tempers and confrontation between agents and other stakeholders in the venue continued to take centre stage as Police quickly wades in to control the physical confrontations. -Advertisement- In the meantime, results are available to our correspondent in Billiri for Gombe Central and Gombe North Senator Muhammad Danjuma Goje won the election for Gombe central with 100 votes beating Alhaji Habu Mu’azu, three votes, and Barrister Abdullahi Idris Umar, two votes. In Malam Sidi, the venue for Gombe North primary election, Senator Sa’idu Ahmed Alkali emerged as the Senatorial Candidate of the party for the Gombe North District. He emerged the winner after scoring 216, the highest votes cast, defeating his closest rival, Bala Bello Tinka, who scored 31 votes, while Haidar Aliyu Abubakar, scored 10 votes. However, just before our correspondent left the venue of the Gombe South primary election, over an hour and ten minutes after the votes were sorted out, the returning officer for the election, Sabo Sani, hurriedly announced Senator Joshua Lidani as the winner of the election with 90 votes while Senator Bulus K Amos got 40 votes. He said Bilyaminu Babadidi scored 70 votes. The announcement which did not go down well with the majority of the supporters within and outside the venue of the election started shouting against the result. Supporters of Babadidi particularly described it as a daylight robbery. POLL As of the time of filing this report, the place was full of rancour and our correspondent had to scamper out of the venue for safety.
