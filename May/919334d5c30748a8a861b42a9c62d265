The world’s governing body for basketball banned Russian and Belarusian men’s and women’s teams from World Cup competition this year and next in response to the war in Ukraine. FIBA’s executive committee on Wednesday made final an earlier decision to bar all teams from Russia and Belarus from competing in either the women’s World Cup, which begins in September in Sydney, or men’s World Cup qualifiers for the 2023 Cup in southeast Asia, as well as numerous 3×3 competitions. Additionally, there will be no FIBA-sponsored events in Russia or Belarus until further notice. -Advertisement- The Russian women’s team had qualified for the Sydney World Cup. Puerto Rico will take its place there, FIBA announced. On the men’s side, the Russian team was 3-0 in European qualifying play, including an 80-69 win over the Netherlands on Feb. 24 — the day the Russian army invaded Ukraine. The Russian men’s team is currently ranked 15th in the world, ahead of FIBA-competitive countries like Turkey, Canada, Croatia, and Nigeria. Team USA’s men’s and women’s teams are each ranked No. 1 in the world, and are defending Olympic gold medalists. Being barred from World Cup play makes it more difficult for the Russians (and Belarusians) to qualify for the 2024 Paris Olympic tournament.
