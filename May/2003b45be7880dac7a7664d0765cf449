An online report on Sunday alleged that a truckload of cows was set on fire by unknown gunmen in Uga Aguata’s local government area of Anambra State. Sunday Independent gathered that the truck was on its way to a market when the gunmen struck. Eyewitness reports reveal some occupants of the truck were injured in the deadly attack, according to him, “Unknown gunmen have burnt down a truck loaded with cows at Uga, Aguata LGA in the early hour of Sunday. -Advertisement- This attack is coming a few weeks after a military couple was gruesomely killed by gunmen in Imo State. The Killing elicited negative reactions from Nigerians who demanded immediate action from security agencies in ensuring the capture of the culprits.” But when our correspondent contacted the Southeast Zonal Chairman of Miyetti Allah Cattle Breeders Association (MACBAN) of Nigeria Alhaji Gidado Soddiki, he said he has not got the full details of the incident but was reliably informed that the cows belonging to the Uga people were saved. Soddiki also told our correspondent that the truck was returning from the North to Uga where the indigenes who were owners of the cows were waiting for their consignments. Also, the Police Public Relations Officer of the Anambra State Command of the Nigeria Police DSP Ikenga Tochi reliably informed our correspondent that the cattle were rescued by police operatives unhurt but the front of the truck was burnt. POLL Ikenga said it took the timely intervention of police operatives in conjunction with community people to rescue the driver of the truck and the cows even as he pointed out that the real cause of the mayhem has not been ascertained.
