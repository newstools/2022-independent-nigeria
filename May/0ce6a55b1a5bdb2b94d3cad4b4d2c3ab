The General Overseer of Eagles Ministries City of God aka Mountain of Authority and Testimony, Pastor Prince John Npumechi, has said that there will be problem in the land if the youths are not given the opportunity in the nation’s leadership. He maintained that if the issue of youth leadership is not properly addressed, there will never be general elections next year. He maintained that the youth should endeavour to replace the old politicians, who he said had continually perpetuated themselves in positions of authority. He stressed: “With God, elections will hold. God is the only person that can sanction election’s activities come 2023.” He noted that Nigerian need to arise and shun evil for the nation to move forward, adding, “We need help from God. Only God can move Nigeria forward. Without God Nigeria is going nowhere. “Youth in this country should arise and take their destinies in their hands. They are sitting on their destiny. “They don’t have to sit on the fence. They need to come closer to God, and address evil as evil. If they must succeed, they must shun the old breed approach.”
