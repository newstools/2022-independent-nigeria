U.S. President Joe Biden signed a bill that will send roughly $40 billion in aid to Ukraine into law on Saturday during his trip to South Korea, according to the White House. The bill, which was overwhelmingly approved by the Senate on Thursday, includes military, economic and humanitarian assistance, and is by far the largest U.S. aid package for Ukraine to date. During his Asia trip, Biden also signed the “Access to Baby Formula Act of 2022” into law, which allows “the waiver of certain program requirements in the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) due to a supply chain disruption or emergency.”
