Following the recent viral video of a lady caught having sexual relations with a dog, Nollywood actress, Cossy Orjiakor, has demanded justice, crying out to the Nigeria Police Force to solve the case of her being reportedly accused of sleeping with a dog. Recall that in 2002,  the then publisher of Enquirer Magazine, Tunde Moshood, reported that the actress was involved in sexual relations with a dog, also releasing footage of the actress where she appeared to be practicing bestiality with a dog. However, she had debunked the report, expressing the video was from a movie scene titled Itohan, which was trying to reveal how ladies are being trafficked and used as sex slaves in other countries. -Advertisement- Orjiakor made this call on Wednesday via her Instagram page, urging police operatives to look into the case again and clear her name as her reputation and career were destroyed due to the alleged reports. Her post reads, “I reported this case years ago. But I was just a naive girl, a nobody. It was all over the news. Cossy Orjiakor slept with Dog and got HIV. My image, emotional trauma, my career, everything went down the drain. I lost my sense of purpose. Up to date, no justice, no apologies. Nothing. “It’s really an insult to me when the Nigerian police went after the girl on TikTok that jokingly said she slept with a dog. What about me that was in the magazine headline. Am I invisible? “Please, solve this case and punish whoever is found guilty. Either Cossy, the girl that supposedly slept with a dog, or Mr. Tunde Moshood of the ENQUIRER magazine, who is now a politician in Lagos state. “The journalist that made millions from the story that broke me. Please, my Instagram family help me tag the right police handle because I lost hope in the Nigerian justice system. It still hurts. I want justice. Thank you.”
