A man from North Carolina has completed his 5-month trek along the 1,175-mile North Carolina Mountains-to-Sea Trail. Carrying trekking poles and with his signature full beard, “Trail” Marshall finished the home stretch on May 6, arriving at Jockey’s Ridge State Park in Nags Head, N.C. Marshall began using the moniker Trail rather than his given name when he started hiking about two years ago, starting with a brisk 406-day trek along the Appalachian Trail in June 2020. -Advertisement- The North Carolina resident has documented his journey on social media, posting pictures and videos along the way.
