Following the presidential primaries of the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) held on Saturday in Abuja, the Governor of Rivers State and presidential aspirant, Nyesom Wike has said he would not allow himself to be treated as a second class citizen in the country. Daily Independent had earlier reported that Governor Wike lost out at the presidential primary election of the party to former Vice President Atiku Abubakar. Wike who spoke at a reception in his honour at the Government House in Port Harcourt after his return from the primary election said that the North should not claim ownership of the country and that Nigeria does not belong to a particular geo-political zone. -Advertisement- Commenting on the outcome of the election, he said, “We have all it takes to do whatever we want to do. It is a matter of you to be fruitful. We cannot answer second class citizens in Nigeria. “We just used this one to tell them that enough is enough. We made them not to sleep, we made them not to eat, we made all of them from wherever they think they are coming from know that there is somebody who can take them on. “This country does not belong to one particular zone. If people are afraid of talking, it is their business. I cannot be a second class citizen in my country. “They just want somebody they can control, somebody that will do whatever they want him to do, I will never be a party to that. “The only people that can control me are Nigerians, not the few people that want to remain in power since the military regime”. POLL Speaking further, Governor Wike accused the Southern Governors of betrayal during the election process. He said, “Shame to those who will sell out their own,” he said, maintaining that “I have never seen a thing like that”. “No wonder we cannot move on with development. Look at, a region ganged up. Then, your own region cannot gang up. “You became a tool to be used against the interest of your people and you think you have won. You have lost.”
