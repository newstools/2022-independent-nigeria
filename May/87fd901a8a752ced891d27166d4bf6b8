World football governing body, FIFA have ordered the Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) to pay the sum of $1, 045,000 compensation and salaries to former Super Eagles Coach, Gernot Rohr. Rohr was sacked as Super Eagles head coach in December 2021 while still being owed several months’ salaries as well as bonuses and allowances. The German reported the NFF to FIFA and the world football governing body has ordered them to pay him $1,045,000 (about N433, 873,550.00 officially) to cover his entitlements and additional compensation. -Advertisement- NFF sources confirmed on Monday that the ruling was made on April 22 but kept under wraps, and the body is not considering an appeal. FIFA ruled that the NFF had no justifiable reason to terminate Rohr’s contract in the manner that they did, especially as they were owing him a large sum. The world body also clarified that Rohr must be paid in dollars and not naira since he is no longer based in Nigeria. Recalled that Rohr was named as the Super Eagles’ head coach in 2016 and he was the longest-serving coach of the team with his over five years in charge. The former Burkina Faso head coach was believed to be earning around $55,000 monthly in Nigeria. POLL He is yet to be replaced with a permanent successor after Austin Eguavoen’s disastrous spell as interim head coach. Under Eguavoen’s three-month stint, the Super Eagles fell in the second round of the Africa Cup of Nations in January and lost out to Ghana in the World Cup playoffs in March. FIFA says Nigeria had no reason to sacked Gernot Rohr last December and has ordered the NFF to pay him his entitlements.
