Michelle Jackson, former wife of Nigeria music producer, Michael Ajereh, popularly known as Don Jazzy, has revealed that the Mavin Records owner’s love for music led to the end of their 2-year-old marriage. Jackson disclosed this during an interview with Naija FM, expressing that she had to let him go as they were both young at the time. She said, “Don Jazzy is music, and he just needed to go and be himself and go and do his music. Music kind of got in the way of the relationship and we were young as well. -Advertisement- “We were both pursuing their music careers at the same time and then he got discovered by JJC Skillz. So it took him out of the home a lot more. I tried to put my music on the back burner to try and balance my home life.”
