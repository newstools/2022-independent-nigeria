The campaign train of a former Minister of Defence, Senator Musiliu Obanikoro, who is seeking to represent Lagos West in the Senate in 2023, moved to Badagry on Monday, with a courtesy call on the revered monarch of the Akran of Badagry, De Wheno Aholu Menu Toyi I. Obanikoro, who was well received by women and youth in the area, expressed joy at the warm reception by his people. He, however, hinted to the monarch, that returning to Badagry is like a homecoming because his forebears were from Ikare, Idoluwo-Ile in Badagry and that he has a flourishing farm in the area that provided employment for many young ones in the area. -Advertisement- He acknowledged that Badagry is under-developed, but quickly intimated that he has used his office while he served as Minister of State for Defence and other positions he has attained to contribute his quota to the development of the area, attracted infrastructures including recruitments of indigenes to the Police Force, Immigration and prisons among others. He solicited the blessings of the monarch and his cabinet made up of Chiefs from different communities and districts with a promise to attract more projects to the area if elected as the Senator representing the district. The monarch prayed for Obanikoro and his entourage and also prayed for the state. He assured Obanikoro of the support of his people and urged him to continue in his quest towards representing the district in the senate and never to disappoint them.
