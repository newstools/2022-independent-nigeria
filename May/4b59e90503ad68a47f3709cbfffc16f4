Following the gruesome murder of Deborah Yakubu by her fellow students for alleged blasphemy against Prophet Mohammed, Former Aviation minister, Femi Fani-Kayode has thrown a subtle shade at Former Vice President Atiku Abubarkar, declaring him a coward. Atiku had allegedly deleted posts he shared on his Facebook and Twitter pages about a Christian girl, Deborah Samuel who was killed by a mob in Sokoto state over alleged blasphemy less than an hour later after some Northerners threatened not to vote for him in the 2023 presidential election. The post shared on Facebook and Twitter read; -Advertisement- “There can not be a justification for such gruesome murder. Deborah Yakubu was murdered, and all those behind her d*ath must be brought to justice. My condolences to her family and friends.” Reacting to this, FFK said the refusal to condemn the killing of Deborah and the withdrawal of an earlier condemnation is worse than the killing itself. Sharing a post on his Instagram page, FFK wrote, ‘’Any so-called leader that remains silent and refuses to publicly condemn the murder of Deborah is a COWARD. I do not care who or what you are: if you cannot bring yourself to condemn this cold-blooded and horrific murder then you are nothing but a COWARD and I have contempt for you. POLL The refusal to condemn the killing of Deborah and the withdrawal of an earlier condemnation is worse than the killing itself. By this Atiku Abubakar has murdered Deborah all over again and pissed on her grave. He has also encouraged other sociopaths and homicidal maniacs to crawl out from the woodwork and commit more murders with impunity.’’
