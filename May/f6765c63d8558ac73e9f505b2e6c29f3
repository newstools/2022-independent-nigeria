Ivan Perisic has sent an emotional message to Inter Milan fans ahead of his transfer to Tottenham. With his contract at the San Siro coming to an end this summer, the Croatian international is set to join Antonio Conte’s Spurs side on a two-year deal. Joining Inter Milan in 2015 from German side Wolfsburg, Perisic has played a key role for the Nerazzurri over the years and helped them to the Serie A title in 2020/21. After 254 games, the 33-year-old will now head to the Premier League for a new challenge after signing on the dotted line at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium. “After 254 games, 55 goals, 49 assists, 3 trophies and 18,934 minutes spent on the pitch wearing this glorious jersey; my journey here has come to an end,” wrote Perisic on his Instagram account. -Advertisement- “Even though every end means a new beginning it’s important to reflect back on these past years and show you my deepest appreciation for the work accomplished. ⁣⁣⁣⁣It was an unforgettable learning experience for me as a player and for my whole family. ⁣⁣⁣⁣ “To the team, the staff, to all the employees but most importantly to the fans : you will always have a special place in my heart. I leave feeling privileged having this club in my portfolio.” Reuniting with his former Inter Milan boss Conte having played for him as a left wing-back for the Nerazzurri, the ex-Borussia Dortmund man will help boost the head coach’s options in that area of the pitch. A key position in Conte’s Spurs system with the wing-backs expected to chip in with plenty of goals and assists, Perisic will be a valuable addition after hitting ten goals and nine assists for Inter in 2021/22. He will also bring a wealth of experience to Tottenham after making over 650 appearances in total throughout his career for club and country. Playing a major role in Croatia’s run to the 2018 World Cup final, the new Spurs man has won two Bundesliga titles, Serie A, the Coppa Italia and the Champions League during his career so far.
