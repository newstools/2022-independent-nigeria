Abuja – The Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) has called for holistic engagement of critical stakeholders that would bolster defensive capabilities to ward off cyber security threats on the Nigerian cyberspace. Prof. Umar Garba Danbatta, Executive Vice Chairman of NCC, made the call on Monday at a symposium on Internet Governance and Safeguarding the Cyberspace organised by the Attorney General Alliance, Africa in collaboration with NCC in Abuja. Danbatta underscored the need for government, regulators, law enforcement agents and advocacy groups, the private sector and members of the public to work together to defeat cybercrime. -Advertisement- He said: “The Internet has created a new environment, a complex and dynamic “cyberspace.” “As we learn to live our lives in this cyberspace, there is the concomitant need to avert malicious actors and to bolster defensive capabilities that ward off threats to cyber security. “This calls for holistic engagement of all stakeholders including government and regulators, law enforcement agents and advocacy groups, the private sector and individual members of the public.” He explained that several policy and regulatory initiatives of the Government in Nigeria are focused on harnessing cyberspace and ensuring that the dividends of the digital economy cascade to the citizens. As part of the government’s initiative, he said: “we recently successfully auctioned the 3.5 GHz spectrum for deployment of Fifth Generation (5G) Technology to support the delivery of ubiquitous broadband in the country. POLL “Not resting on its oars, the Commission has through the instrumentality of consultation and international best practices made tremendous milestones in the areas of Standards, Information Security, Consumer Protection and Regulatory Excellence generally.”
