Turkey, who is casting itself as a potential peacemaker between Russia and Ukraine is hoping the war can bolster its regional power, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty’s RFE/RL said. Business interests are constituting a big part of the equation, it said in an analysis on the weekend. Given Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan’s domestic woes ahead of the upcoming parliamentary elections in June 2023, that his ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) is suffering from falling polling numbers, he “could use some good news,” according to the analysis. -Advertisement- The Ukraine war could provide some for Erdoğan, by pushing his role as a potential mediator, it said. NATO member Turkey, which enjoys close relations with Russia, has sought to remain neutral in the Ukrainian-Russian conflict and is seeking to act as a mediator to end the war. While declaring support for Ukraine during the Russian invasion by calling on Moscow to respect its territorial integrity, it has refused to issue sanctions against Russia or businessmen close to President Vladimir Putin, saying both Russia and Ukraine trust it to act as a fair broker for a solution. Turkey has hosted two rounds of peace negotiations between Russia and Ukraine since Russia invaded in late February. “Ankara has staked out a position of maximum benefit, trying to exploit the conflict as much as possible for its own good,” political scientist Ivan Preobrazhensky told RFE/RL’s Russian service. “While it may be urging a de-escalation of Russia’s war on Ukraine, Turkey can exploit the conflict to raise its regional profile,” he said. POLL Turkey is heavily relying on Russian tourist and Russia provides a huge market for Turkish vegetables and fruits, the analysis said. While Moscow and Ankara have signed a number of trade and economic deals in recent years, Turkey also became Ukraine’s biggest foreign investor, it said.
