Former Real Madrid winger Angel Di Maria, who will be a free agent this summer after his contract with Paris Saint-Germain expires, has been offered to Barcelona, reports Mundo Deportivo. Di Maria’s seven-year stint at Parc des Princes will come to an end this summer as the 34-year-old’s contract expires on June 30 and the two parties have agreed to part ways. The Argentine superstar was given a fine farewell this past weekend when PSG played FC Metz in their Ligue 1 of the season. Di Maria will be leaving Les Parisiens after featuring in close to 300 games in which he registered 93 goals and 119 assists. -Advertisement- With Di Maria now becoming a free agent, he will be able to choose his next destination before next season. And, as per the report, the former Real Madrid winger has offered himself to Barcelona, who are in the market for a new wide player. Di Maria had been offered to the Catalans back in 2017 when Neymar had left the club for Barcelona, but the Blaugrana opted to sign Ousmane Dembele. And, the 34-year-old is again offering himself to the La Liga giants as he desires to play at Camp Nou. With Ousmane Dembele’s contract expiring, Barça need a new winger. But even though Di Maria has emerged as an opportunity, they are reluctant to land the Argentine. The Catalan giants have Raphinha as their top target to bolster the flanks. In addition to that, Di Maria’s age (34) is also a roadblock. Barcelona are already targeting Cesar Azpilicueta (32), Marcos Alonso (31) and Robert Lewandowski (33) and do not want to sign more players into their thirties. So, even though Di Maria’s gesture is appreciated, and his signing would be financially viable due to his free agency, Barcelona do not wish to sign the former Real Madrid man. POLL Instead, the Catalan giants will continue to focus on landing Raphinha, while Di Maria could be headed to Juventus, who are keen on signing the winger.
