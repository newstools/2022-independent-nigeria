Nollywood actor, Mr Segun Arinze has charged insurers to come out with insurance packages that would cover his colleagues in event of health challenges and other calamities that may befall them, saying that he is tired of making donations to those down in health. Arinze made the remark when he appeared as a special guest at the April edition of the NCRIB’s evening hosted by Universal Insurance Plc in Lagos recently. According to him, the Nollywood industry is a vast market for insurance operators to explore and make money while at the same time contributing to the wellbeing of actors and actresses who need finances when misfortuned. -Advertisement- The veteran actor noted that Nollywood in its thirty years of robust existence has contributed immensely to the wellbeing of Nigerians by providing employment to thousands of players in the sector. He pointed out that although his colleagues do not believe in insurance, but would listen if a good package that meets individual and collective needs is put in place to provide succor when the need arises. Arinze decried that his members are always subjected to charity whenever anyone of them is visited by ill health. Responding to the actor’s request, Rotimi Edu, president, NCRIB accepted the challenge thrown up by Mr Arinze as he assured him of coming out with insurance products that would assuage the misfortune of Nollywood members. Returning the charge, Edu also request that Nollywood should do scripts that would promote ideals and values of insurance among Nigerians.
