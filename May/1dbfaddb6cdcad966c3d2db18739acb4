Rangers managing director Stewart Robertson has said his club are working with UEFA to establish fan zones for next Wednesday’s Europa League final in Seville. The Scottish Premiership side will take on Germany’s Eintracht Frankfurt in the showpiece event at the Ramon Sanchez Pizjuan Stadium. Rangers fans have been dismayed by the fact both clubs have only received 10,000 tickets each for the final in a 42,000-seater stadium. -Advertisement- But Robertson did deliver some good news regarding fan zones when he spoke ahead of Rangers’ first European final since 2008. Robertson said: “The discussions are well advanced but there is a lot that has to be organised to put these things on. “I think there’s maybe a perception you just have a bit of space and the fans go in — sorted. But there’s a lot more to it than that. How do people get there? Where is it in relation to Frankfurt fans? How do you ensure basics of food, drinks and toilets etc? “There’s a lot that goes into it. Hopefully in the next few days we will have positive news on that. “It’s been an eye-opener the amount of work that has gone into this match is incredible from both clubs and UEFA as well as the local authorities.” POLL Robertson has told Rangers fans with or without tickets to enjoy themselves in Seville while he revealed a screening of the game at Ibrox is “very unlikely”. He added: “I remember myself in 2008 thinking, ‘will I see Rangers in a European final again?’ and here we are. “It’s fantastic. Go and enjoy the occasion, go and be a great ambassador for Rangers. “We are going to a beautiful city, go and enjoy the city but let’s do it in the right way and manner. But go and have a good time.”
