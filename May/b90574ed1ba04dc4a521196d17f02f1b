Emma Raducanu hopes to inspire the next generation by taking her US Open tro­phy to schools across the United Kingdom. The ‘Emma Raducanu Trophy Tour’ will begin in London on Monday, May 9 and finish in Edinburgh on Friday, May 13. The 19-year-old ended Britain’s 44-year wait for a women’s Grand Slam sin­gles champion at Flushing Meadows last year. -Advertisement- “My hope is that the trophy will inspire them to continue their tennis journey both inside and outside of school,” Radu­canu said. Raducanu became the first qualifier in the Open era to win a Grand Slam during her astonishing run in New York in September. She has struggled with injury and consistency since then and was ham­pered by a back injury in her third-round defeat at the Madrid Open on Mon­day. “What Emma achieved was incredible and we want to use her success to get more school children playing tennis and en­courage our future tennis stars,” Scott Lloyd, chief executive of the Lawn Ten­nis Association (LTA), said.
