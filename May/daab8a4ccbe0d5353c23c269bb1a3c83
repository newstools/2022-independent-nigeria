The convener of Concerned Nigerians, Deji Adeyanju has urged the National Leader of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Asiwaju Bola Tinubu and Vice President Yemi Osinbajo to step down for the South-East to produce the next president in the 2023 general election. Adeyanju made the appeal while reacting to the call by some imminent Nigerians that the two major political parties, APC and the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) should zone their presidential ticket to the southern part of the country. The Abuja-based activist said the only way the southeast can achieve the Igbo presidency in 2023 is when Tinubu and Osinbajo both step down their presidential ambitions in favour of the South-East. -Advertisement- Speaking via his official Facebook Page, Adeyanju stressed that such calls would only unite the North. He wrote, “The protests demanding for Southern presidency at both APC and PDP secretariats are a waste of time. It will only unite the North. “The best way to ensure South gets presidency is for Tinubu, Osinbajo and others to step down their ambition for South-East in the interest of equity.”
