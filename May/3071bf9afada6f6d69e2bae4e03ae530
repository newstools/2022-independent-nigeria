Lagos – The final of the CAF Confederation Cup holds today, Friday, May 20, 2022 in Uyo, Nigeria with Orlando Pirates of South Africa playing Morocco’s RS Berkane. All the footballing action will be available to stream live on Showmax Pro in Africa from 20:00 (WAT), courtesy of Super- Sport. Orlando Pirates will be playing in their fourth CAF final despite a shock home defeat to Al Ahli Tripoli in their second semifinal leg as they advanced 2-1 on aggregate to secure their place in the final. -Advertisement- Their opponents, RS Berkane, defeated Congolese giants TP Mazembe 4-2 over two legs. RS Berkane, the 2019/2020 CAF Confederations Cup champions, will be playing in their third final after coming up short in 2018/19 when they finished as runners up. The Soweto giants have not enjoyed a good domestic season as they currently sit seventh in the Premiership. League form normally goes out the window when it comes to cup competitions and this was the case for Ezimnyama Ngenkani as they topped their group, which consisted of Al-Ittihad Tripoli, JS Saoura and Royal Leopards with four wins, one draw and one defeat in their six games. The Orange Boys currently share the same domestic position as their opponents as they sit seventh in the Botola Pro 1, further demonstrating that league form does not translate to cup performances.
