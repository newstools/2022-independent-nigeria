Buhari and Malami added that the same constitution has equally, “The qualifying factors for election into the office of President, Vice President, Governor, Deputy Governor, Senate, House of Representatives, Houses of Assembly and Ministers.” They also prayed the apex court to declare that, by the joint and or combined reading of sections 65, 66, 106, 107, 131, 137, 147, 151, 177, 182, 192 and 196, of the constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, 1999, (as amended), the provisions of section 84 (12) of the Electoral Act, 2022 which also ignores section 84(3) of the same Act, is an additional qualifying and/or disqualifying factors for the National Assembly, House of Assembly, Gubernatorial and Presidential elections as enshrined in the said constitution, hence unconstitutional, unlawful, null and void.

POLL “A declaration that section 84 (12) of the Electoral Act, 2022 disqualifying a political appointee from being a voting delegate or be voted for at a convention or congress of any political party for the purpose of the nomination of candidates for any election is discriminatory, inconsistent with and in violent breach of the provision of each or all of sections 42, 65, 66, 106, 107, 131, 137, 147, 151, 177, 182, 192 and 196 of the constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, 1999, (as amended), as well as Article 2 of the African Charter on Human and Peoples Rights and same is null and void by reason of its inconsistency.” They also prayed for an order nullifying the provisions of section 84 (12) of the Electoral Act, 2022 by application of the blue pencil rule, for being unconstitutional, illegal, null and void and having been made in excess of the legislative powers of the defendant as enshrined in section 4 of the 1999 constitution (as amended).
