Erik ten Hag has attended Manchester United’s final game of the season against Crystal Palace ahead of taking the manager’s job at Old Trafford. The Dutchman is due to replace Ralf Rangnick at the helm this summer, but he has got to work early by travelling to Selhurst Park to watch United play. He was accompanied by Steve McClaren, who will join ten Hag in the dugout next term as a first-team coach. -Advertisement- McClaren is returning for his second spell at the club, having worked under Sir Alex Ferguson for the Red Devils between 1999 and 2001. Ten Hag’s assistant, Mitchell van der Gaag, who was also his colleague at Ajax, was also in attendance to take in the action. United still have something to play for at Palace as they look to end their wretched season on a high note. The 13-time Premier League champions are unable to finish in the top four, but they still do not know whether they will be playing in the Europa League or the Europa Conference League. A win in south London would guarantee them sixth place, and a spot in the Europa League, but any other result would open the door for West Ham to jump above them in the table. POLL Unsurprisingly, Rangnick named a strong team for the final game, despite Cristiano Ronaldo, Marcus Rashford and Jadon Sancho being unavailable due to injury and illness. Teenager Hannibal Mejbri was handed his first Premier League start, giving him the opportunity to impress ten Hag and prove that he deserves to be in his plans next season.
