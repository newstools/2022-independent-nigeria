She highlighted the scope of the partnership as one that would strengthen the internal mechanisms of institutions to combat sexual assault as a systemic issue through in­novative policies, communi­ty-led bystander intervention and creative integration of technology to enhance institu­tional accountability, promote access to justice, generate data and ensure effective case man­agement. She revealed that they are in partnership with individ­ual institutions and as such this partnership with the Ondo State Government is highly commendable because the State Government is tak­ing ownership of the process while facilitating Gender Mo­bile’s support to institution­alise prevention.
