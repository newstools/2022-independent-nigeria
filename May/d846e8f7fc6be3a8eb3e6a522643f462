Fixed Berthing Window was first launched in mid- 2021 at APM Terminals Apapa, and introduced at West Africa Container Terminal (WACT) in Onne, Meridian Port Services (MPS) in Tema and APM Terminals Nouakchott later in 2021/22. Fixed Berthing Windows have been made possible due to a strong collaboration between teams, creative network solutions and focused execution. -Advertisement- FBW has enabled a reduction of deployed capacity by 15%, while slightly increasing carrying capacity thus allowing TEU to save capacity, improved productivity and reduction in vessel waiting time.
