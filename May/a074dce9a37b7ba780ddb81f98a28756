A former presidential aide, Reno Omokri, has warned politicians against relying solely on Twitter or any other social media platforms for political campaigns ahead of the 2023 general election. Omokri disclosed this on Saturday in a series of tweets via his Twitter account, expressing that ground work is more influential than Twitter influence. He wrote, “Twitter is influential. But ground work is more influential. That’s why Shehu Sani, with over 2 million followers, only secured 2 votes. One vote for each million! While Bashir Ahmad with his 1 million followers, got 16 votes. Do the leg work. Dont rely on Twitter. -Advertisement- “I have said this multiple times. The entire Nigerian population on Twitter and Facebook is less than 20 million. That means there are by far more Nigerians who either do not have access to social media, or who are not interested. You can only reach them offline! “Donald Duke also had passionate social media support. His was even more energetic than what we see today. He won polls on Twitter. His followers attacked anyone not 100% for him. On Election Day, he got 34k votes. Why? Because politicians always defeat politwitters!”
