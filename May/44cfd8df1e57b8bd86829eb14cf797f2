Lagos – Deputy President, ITTF Africa and Vice President, ITTF, Nigeria’s Wahid Oshodi has applauded ITTF’s new ranking system on the premise that it is more representative of the current level of players. Oshodi, who was recently appointed chair of the ITTF World Ranking Working Group, said that matters relating to players’ ranking were very important and felt quite confident that the WRWG would improve and resolve historic issues surrounding the rankings. The ITTF Executive Committee has adopted the WRWG proposal to remove the “initial points”, the extension of the validity of all points gained during 2021 senior events, and the restriction of the number of youth events counting towards the senior ranking. -Advertisement- “The WRWG recommended the removal of the “initial points” for a variety of reasons. The abnormal situation brought upon the world by the Covid-19 pandemic prevented us from staging planned events, and the “initial points” allowed us to keep the World Rankings alive, but some of these “initial points” included points from events as far back as 2018. As the pandemic subsides, we have been able to stage more events around the world,” stated Oshiodi in a statement on Wednesday. “The general feeling among players, fans, and ourselves was that the Rankings were not truly representative of the current standard of the players. Some players making rapid progress over the last year did not see their performances being accurately reflected in the Rankings. “Therefore, it was time to remove these “initial points”. POLL “We are confident that the performances of players in tournaments will have an immediate impact on their Ranking thus allowing them to climb up the Rankings, consequently giving them the opportunity to take part in the top tier events; with this change, performances in the many upcoming events will have the importance they deserve in the Rankings and will generate some interesting movements in the following weeks and months,” he said.
