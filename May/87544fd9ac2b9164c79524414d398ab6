Ikechukwu Ezenwa, the Super Eagles and Heartland of Owerr goalkeeper, has called on the League Management Company (LMC), organisers of the Nigeria professional Football League (NPFL), to, as a means of nipping in the bud, the recurring hoo­liganism in the league, per­manent ban erring clubs from home turf for rest of the season. The goalkeeper, who spoke on the recurring is­sues of hooliganism in the league, said that banishing the offending club to the lower league would not be the issue, suggesting that LMC should send the err­ing teams to neutral ground far from their homes for the rest of the season. “Remove them from their home for entire sea­son; their fans will miss them a lot. It is not about fine. -Advertisement- “If you say pay money, the governors will readily pay such amount and allow the teams and their fans to continue to perpetuate such evil. “Hooliganism is giving our league a bad image and everything should be done to stop it. “I don’t believe in fining them and telling them to go and play outside their homes for may be few weeks. “Let they go far from their home for the rest of the season; that way, they won’t have fans around them to cause troubles. “In other leagues even in Africa, teams go away and win matches and no one will attack the referee or the visiting teams; why should we be having such trouble in Nigeria. This is the right time to stop this,” he said. POLL Ezenwa has been a veter­an of the NPFL with appear­ances for a couple of clubs in the domestic league, in­cluding Enyimba.
