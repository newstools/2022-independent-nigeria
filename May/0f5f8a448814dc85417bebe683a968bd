Bukayo Saka could equal a club record set by Ian Wright when the Arsenal face West Ham United in today’s En­glish Premier League (EPL) clash. The 20-year-old striker now has 11 goals to his name in the 2021-22 top-flight campaign – the last two of which have come from the penalty spot against Chelsea and Man­chester United. Despite his Euro 2020 penalty woes, Saka stepped up at Stamford Bridge to send Edouard Mendy the wrong way before repeat­ing the trick against David de Gea in last weekend’s 3-1 win. Should Saka convert another penalty in today’s game at the London Stadi­um, he will become only the second Arsenal player to score from 12 yards in three consecutive English Premier League (EPL) matches. Arsenal’s second-high­est scorer of all-time Wright is the only Gun­ner to have done so pre­viously in the 1993/94 season, netting from the spot against Oldham Ath­letic, Ipswich Town and Southampton – scoring hat-tricks against the latter two. Saka is already the youngest-ever player to score penalties in back-to-back English Premier League (EPL) games, and the England international is expected to be fit for the West Ham clash despite an injury scare against Man United. The Gunners head into today’s game fourth in the table on 60 points, but they could be leapfrogged by Tottenham Hotspur a couple of hours before they take to the field at the London Stadium.
