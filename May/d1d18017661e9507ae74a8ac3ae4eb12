Former Minister of Transportation and 2023 presidential aspirant on the platform of All Progressives Congress (APC), Rotimi Amaechi, has urged the Kogi State Governor and fellow presidential aspirant, Alhaji Yahaya Bello, to step down as he is the leading aspirant. Amaechi disclosed this while speaking at the Government House in Lokoja, the state capital, expressing that he is the leading contestant because he is older with more experience. The former Rivers State Governor said, “This is the 28th state I will be visiting. I can no longer be called one of the APC aspirants because I have become the leading aspirant. -Advertisement- “I was Speaker at the age of 34, Governor at the age of 42, and a minister in my early 50s. I have acquired the needed experiences to lead Nigeria. “I am a former Chairman of Speakers forum, two-term Chairman of Governorship forum, coupled with my interaction as Presidential DG campaign, I have what it takes to lead a country like ours. “I am aware that His Excellency is also a contestant, but I am the only leading contestant, older with more experience and I want to inform him that I will provide him with the necessary experience he needs to govern when the time comes.”
