The recent Kia EV9 all-electric concept Sports Utility Vehicle (SUV) that debuted in November 2021 is apparently being fast-tracked for production, with company bosses claiming the 300-mile production version is coming by the end of next year. Expect it to command a premium over the similarly sized, combustion-powered Kia Telluride when the new EV goes on sale— likely starting around $50,000. There were heavy hints that something like the EV9 was headed to dealerships sooner than expected when it debuted in Los Angeles. Now, in interviews with auto journalists, Kia executives confirmed the EV9 will go into production in the second-half of next year. -Advertisement- We can expect the exterior of the concept model to mostly make it to the final production form, according to Tom Kearns, the Chief Designer, but the conceptual interior will get a much more practical overhaul. The model is expected to get around the 300 miles of range figure touted at the concept’s reveal, which Steven Center, Kia Chief Operating Officer (COO) told the media is the “sweet spot or minimum entry for a larger vehicle” without the weight penalty of a larger battery pack. The EV9 will ride on a stretched version of the Kia EV6’s E-GMP platform with 800- volt fast-charging electric architecture. The EV6—a much smaller vehicle than the EV9 is anticipated to be—sports 320 horsepower and 446 lb-ft of torque. At a 350 kW charge rate, the platform’s battery pack replenishes from 10 to 80 per cent in just 20 to 30 minutes. The production EV9 SUV will also spawn at least one similar pickup truck based on the same E-GMP platform, and Kia has previously announced at least two new EV pickups are coming to the global market in the next few years.
