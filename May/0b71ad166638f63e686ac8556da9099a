Nigerian activist, Aisha Yesufu, has reacted to the gruesome killing of a female student of the Shehu Shagari College of Education, identified as Ms Deborah over blasphemy of Prophet Mohammed. Recall that a viral video of a Muslim mob stoning and burning the female student caused a stir on the internet earlier today. According to the co-founder of the #BringBackOurGirls movement via her Twitter account on Thursday, people who participate in jungle justice by lynching thieves are also the same as the sokoto students who killed their fellow student. -Advertisement- She wrote, “If you are one of those that lynch thieves just take this moment to know that you and those sokoto students who killed their fellow student are the same. “Hope you use this as a mirror into your despicable acts. “No one has the right in anyway whatsoever to kill another. No one!”
