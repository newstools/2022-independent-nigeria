Mikel Arteta has made essential changes to the Arsenal lineup as Rob Holding replaces Ben White, while Gabriel Martinelli is preferred to Emile Smith Rowe. Mikel Arteta has named his strongest available team to face Everton for the season’s final game, hoping to secure three points and end a run of two consecutive defeats. There are necessary changes made to the side that lost to Newcastle United. Rob Holding, as expected, returns to the fold after serving a one-match suspension, replacing Ben White at the heart of the Arsenal defence. Gabriel Magalhaes will play alongside Holding in the central defensive partnership, while Cedric Soares is selected ahead of the injured Takehiro Tomiyasu at right-back. -Advertisement- Nuno Tavares keeps his spot at left-back, while Aaron Ramsdale is preferred in goal ahead of Bernd Leno. Mohamed Elneny will hold the midfield for Arsenal, with Granit Xhaka and Martin Odegaard deployed in the advanced No.8 roles. Bukayo Saka becomes the youngest Arsenal player to play in every game of a Premier League season after Cesc Fabregas in 2006/07, with the 20-year-old lining up on the right side of the Arsenal attack. Gabriel Martinelli replaces Emile Smith Rowe in the starting eleven, while Eddie Nketiah continues to lead the line for Arsenal against Everton. Arsenal Starting Lineup: Ramsdale, Cedric, Holding, Gabriel, Tavares, Elneny, Saka, Odegaard, Xhaka, Martinelli, Nketiah
