Bankole Olowookere, the coach of Flamingoes, Nigeria’s U17 women team, has said they would not underrate their Ethi­opian counterparts for a place at this year’s FIFA U17 women World Cup in India. To reach this final stage, Flamingoes trounced the Egyptian U-17 girls 6-0 on ag­gregate after a 2-0 win in Cairo on Saturday. The girls qualified for the final round of the qualifiers where they’ll face Ethiopia. A victory over Ethiopia will help them book a ticket to the U-17 World Cup in India. Olowookere stated that they would approach the game against their Ethiopian coun­terparts as if their lives depend on it. “Nothing has been achieved yet because we still have the game against Ethiopia to play. “One thing is sure, we are not going to underrate them because to get to this stage, they also tried. “We are going to redouble our efforts because we have our sights set on going to the World Cup and reachingthisstage, Iam not sure we will take anything for granted,” the coach said. In the match against Egypt on Saturday, Nigeria’s attacker Opeyemi Ajakaye started from where she stopped in Abuja a fortnight ago where they won 4-0, as she gave the team a lead as early as the 5th minute. POLL Oluwatunmininu Adesina came close to scoring from a free kick in the 12th minute but the Egyptian goalkeeper was alert to make a smart save. Barely two minutes after coming close, Amina Bello doubled the Flamingoes ad­vantage as she scored in the 14th minute. Goalkeeper Faith Omilana was a behemoth against the Egyptians as she made suc­cessive saves to help keep the Flamingoes’ advantage. The lively Ajakaye came close to increasing her tally many times but was denied by the goalkeeper and the goal post. Nigeria made changes in the second half with Ayanto­sho Yetunde coming in as a 76th-minute substitute in place of Alvine Dah-Zossu. The Egyptians threatened to reduce the deficit but the im­pressive Omilana was a solid rock in the Nigerian goal.
