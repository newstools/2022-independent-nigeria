Professor Uchenna Eleazar Ikonne has emerged as the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) flag bearer in Abia State, beating two other aspirants in the race. Ikonne, the immediate past Vice Chancellor of Abia State University, Uturu (ABSU), scored 468 votes to beat his closest rival, a USA-based businessman, Mr Lucky Igbokwe who received 45 votes. In a governorship primary supervised by former governor of Ekiti State, Chief Ayo Fayose, some aspirants such as the Senate Minority Chief Whip, Enyinnaya Abaribe, Mr Nnanna Nwafor, Hon Sampson Orji, Chief Ncheta Elvis Omerekpe, Deputy Governor, Rt Hon Ude Oko Chukwu, Dr Desmond China Anyaso and former PDP State Chairman, Senator Emma Nwaka, withdrew earlier from the race. -Advertisement- Apart from Ikonne, Mr Lucky Igbokwe and Mrs Ezenwanyi Ngozi Jonah others did not show up at the venue of the governorship Primary where only three-man delegates were elected from 184 INEC Wards in the state exercised their franchise. According to those that withdrew from the primary, the exercise was hijacked by Governor Okezie Ikpeazu, adding that those whose names appeared on the list were strange to them. However, despite the publicised withdrawal, some delegates still voted for them. Announcing the result at Umuahia Township Stadium venue of the exercise on Wednesday, Fayose commended the peaceful nature of Abia delegates and assured them of PDP’s readiness to reward loyalty. In his acceptance speech, Ikonne thanked Governor Ikpeazu for serving as the vehicle through which God’s plan and purpose for Abia State will be fulfilled.
