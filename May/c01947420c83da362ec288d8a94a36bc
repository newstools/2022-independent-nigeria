Senatorial aspirant, Delta South, Sylvester Onoyona, formally put actions into his aspiration after picking his expression of interest form from the All Progressives Congress (APC), Headquarters, Abuja, on Thursday. After speaking with teeming followers, the adjunct professor on Organisational Leadership went online to engage various groups of Delta Indigenes in and outside the state where he again reiterated his promise to be a senator for all Deltans and Delta South in particular. “I am trusted and strongly reliable,” he said, via a video conference shortly after obtaining his form. -Advertisement- He added that “rescuing Delta South Senatorial district is a collective desire that we must achieve.” Onoyona, arguably has sustained one of the most organic, grassroots-based campaigns in Delta where youth, women, traditional groups and institutions were involved. He has vowed to end the era of the PDP in the zone. He decried what he called the massive failure of the PDP occasioned by deliberate neglect of the Delta South and mindless impoverishment of the people using the weapon of poor representation and governance saying the people deserve much better than that. Human and material development in the district he noted is the poorest among the three Senatorial Districts in the state stressing that he has come to perfect the imperfections in the life of the area and the citizenry. POLL Having purchased the forms, Onoyona said the time has come for all APC faithful in the district to queue behind his aspiration, take the message to the grassroots as he appeals to delegates to consider the need for a better Delta South and vote for him at the forthcoming party primaries coming up at the end of the month.
