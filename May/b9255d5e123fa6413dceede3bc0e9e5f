Following the adoption of Labour Party by National Consultative Front (NCFront), umbrella Third Force Mega Party few days ago, there is report that  Prof Pat Utomi, the National Chairman of the NCFront, is under pressure from the teeming membership of the third Force’ to run and fly the flag of the movement as a presidential aspirant on the platform of the Labour Party. NCFront in a press statement on Tuesday signed by  Ms Biliki Bello, Communications Executive, stated that the association will soon go into full blown party electioneering business, while the incumbent Head of National Secretariat, Che Olawale Okunniyi may have further task to oversee the restructuring of the movement as the National Coordinator of the NCFront. According to the statement the NCFront, the umbrella body of the third force political alternatives to the All Progressives Congress  (APC) and the Peoples Democratic  Party (PDP) is compelled to clarify some unfortunate misconceptions and impression created in the Press following its announcement of the adoption of Labour Party as Nigeria’s Third Force Mega Party for the 2023 Elections. -Advertisement- “Firstly, we wish to reteirate that our adoption of the Labour Party as Third Force Mega Party for the 2023 elections was largely inspired by the positive disposition to Labour Party by our partners and allies in the Labour Movement and in the organised Civil Society and their reassuring actions after several consultations and meetings over the fusion of our structures with the Labour Party. “The NCFront also wishes to clarify that though there’s a strong plan, which is now in the advance stage, to carefully shortlist about seven to political parties, among those that have engaged us in several merger and fusion talks since July 2021, to present a single line of candidates in the 2023 elections, no political party was mentioned in our last statement to have been shortlisted for the historic Mega Electoral Alliance planned to commence after party primaries on the basis of acquiesce of parties and their candidates to a proposed alliance programme for the salvation of Nigeria based on Labour Charter of Demand, #EndSars Youths Demands and Constitutional Referendum for Nigeria, among others to be unveiled after the emergence of Party Candidates,” the statement reads. It added, “Consequently, we wish to state, and this can be cross checked, that NCFront never at any point in our formal press announcement at the weekend listed any Political Party, to have elected in alliance with us to contest on the banner or platform of the Labour Party in the 2023 elections, as erroneously reported in some Press headlines in the social media, save for a mention of three leaders of the movement from three different allied political parties said to be enlisted to drive the 2023 Mega Electoral Pact against the APC and PDP.” “
