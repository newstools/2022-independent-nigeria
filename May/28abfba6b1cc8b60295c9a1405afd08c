ABUJA – The New Nigerian Peoples Party (NNPP) has urged Nigerians not to be discour­aged by the controversy sur­rounding the alleged Expres­sion of Interest to contest the presidential elections, by the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) Governor, Godwin Emefele. NNPP National Chair­man, Professor Rufai Alka­li, at a media briefing at the party secretariat in Abuja, said that though Emefele’s alleged political interest while in office casts a dark shadow on the country’s electoral process, “however, the credibility of the elec­tions depends on Nigerians.” There had been public outcry following tall aged interest by the CBN Gover­nor to run for the position of the President of the country in the 2023 elections. -Advertisement- Stakeholders insisted that it could compromise the credibility of the polls as the Independent National Elec­toral Commission (INEC) warehouses sensitive elec­tion materials at the CBN. But, the NNPP National Chairman insisted that the electoral body had made significant changes to the process, thereby making it more foolproof.
