We will leverage the power of the Armed Forces and address insecurity. We will deploy technology for that purpose. “Poverty issue will be addressed, welfare programme will be introduced, labour will be encouraged and review the wages. How can a minimum wage be N30,000, an amount for a bag of rice? “We can’t move forward until we have peace and security. I will strengthen institutions. We have institutions that are no longer relevant. Some institutions are so weak that we don’t even need them. Individuals are now greater than institutions. That’s why we will adhere to the rule of law. No one will be above the law and the law will be applied. “God created this country as a paradise, but we have turned it to hell. But I will turn around the education sector within 18 months. “There is hunger and poverty in the land. But a political party is selling form at N100 million. A political party that has been borrowing. POLL “We will rebuild Nigeria and reclaim the future. Nigerian will rise again.”
