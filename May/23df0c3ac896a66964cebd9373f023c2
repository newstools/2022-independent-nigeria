JOS – The Gbong Gwom Jos, Da Ja­cob Gyang Buba has appealed to politicians not to venture into actions that will create undue and unnecessary tension that may worsen security of lives and property ahead of the 2023 general elections. Da. Buba disclosed this on Friday during the 2022 Nzem Berom annual cultural festival with a theme, “Celebrating the Berom in Politics” held at the Rwang Pam Township Stadium Jos, Plateau State. “The whole nation today is in a frenzy with heightened political activities and move­ments as the reality of the 2023 general elections draws nearer. This frenzy comes with the un­realistic political promises and gimmicks that are used to lure the very impoverished voters, whose votes may at the end of the day not even count. -Advertisement- “May we at this point plead with the political class to water down the undue and in fact un­necessary tension and the wors­ening insecurity that comes with the advent of elections. “We also wish to remind gov­ernment at all levels and fellow traditional rulers that at the end of it all, we shall give an account of our stewardship to the Cre­ator of the universe, whom we all claim to worship.” The Jos monarch reminded the Federal and State Govern­ments that most Berom people and people from different parts of the state who were displaced as a result of insecurity are yet to return to their ancestral homes. “May I use this opportunity to remind the Federal Govern­ment and the Inspector-Gener­al Police of their promise to set up a Mobile Base in Gashish District of Barkin-Ladi Local Government Area of Plateau, as this is yet to be actualised. “The displaced natives of this district cannot go back to their ancestral lands to pursue their agrarian vocation, raise and train their children since the security threats still exist in the area. We plead for reconsid­eration of this promise.”
