Following the conclusion of the All Progressives Congress, APC primary election for the Albasu/Gaya/Ajingi Federal Constituency in Kano State, former media aide to President Muhammadu Buhari, Bashir Ahmad has rejected the results. Bashir who was aspiring for the position of House of Representatives, lost the election to the incumbent rep, Mahmud Gaya. Daily Post reports that, in a statement he personally issued on Saturday, the former aspirant alleged that there were irregularities in the conduct of the election, saying he and his agents were not allowed to access the results. -Advertisement- He said, “I am sad to say that what ensued at the venue of the primaries highly threatens the credibility and integrity that our party has built over two political cycles. “There could not have been any voting process that occurred considering the fact that the majority of the delegates were neither allowed to vote nor even granted access to the venue. “No document that supposedly validates the election was signed by my agents because they were also denied access to the voting area. “On my arrival to the venue as an aspirant too, I was also denied access to the voting area. My supporters who were around the premises for the election resisted the unjust treatment given to me. “I, therefore call on the stakeholders of our party, the APC, to as a matter of urgency, save the reputation of the party by insisting on the members of the electoral committee to conduct a fresh, free and fair election”
