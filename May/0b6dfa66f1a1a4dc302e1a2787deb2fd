Taiwo Mati dumped out two former champions to win his maiden laurel in the men’s sin­gles at the ITTF Africa Western Region Championships. This is as Fatimo Bello claimed her third consecutive title in the women’s singles of the competition. Meanwhile, in the team events, host Nigeria domi­nated the men and women divisions after beating Cote d’Ivoire and Ghana to retain their titles. -Advertisement- Mati who finished fourth at the national trials organized by the Nigeria Table Tennis Fed­eration (NTTF) won back his confidence after edging out 2019 champion Oba Oba Kizito of Cote d’Ivoire in the quarterfinal as well as his compatriot and 2021 champion Rilwan Akanbi in the semifinal to get passage to the final where he also hum­bled compatriot Azeez Solanke 4-1 (11-6, 7-11, 11-7, 12-10, 11-8) to emerge as the new regional champion. In the women’s singles, Bello continued her dominance with another victory over compatri­ot Bose Odusanya in the final. Bello, who has remained unbeaten since 2019 when she won the maiden title in Abi­djan, Cote d’Ivoire, showed her class when it mattered most with 4-2 (11-6, 7-11, 11-7, 5-11, 11- 5, 11-4) over Odusanya. An excited Mati attributed his triumph to the disappoint­ment he experienced during the national trials. “I could not believe that I would finish fourth at the na­tional trials and this really mo­tivated me to work harder for this competition. POLL “I knew I had to be at my best to be the best and today I was able to show that against my tough rival. He wanted to come back but I just kept to my tactics and this paid off for me at the end of the day for me to win my first regional title,” he said. For Bello, winning this year’s title was tougher than the previous ones.
