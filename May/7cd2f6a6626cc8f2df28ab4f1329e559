Don’t bother about them, they don’t have medical certificates. “The job of the presidency is not about climbing mountains, it is not about carrying cements or wrestling, it is about know­ing what to do and as a doer and thinker to provide the kind of leadership that Nigerians need”, adding that, leadership is from God and only him has the pow­ers to give and take it as well. The APC Presidential hope­ful made the declaration after a closed-door meeting with the Governor, the former Governor of Borno State, Alhaji Ibrahim Kashim Shettima and one of the Governorship aspirants in the state, Hon.
