Following the extension of the ongoing strike by the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU), students of Obafemi Awolowo University (OAU) Ile-Ife, Osun state, led other students in protest, blocking the Ife-Ibadan Expressway. The protest resumed as early as 7 a.m., with students blocking the highway around Oduduwa University, thereby creating gridlock inward and outward of Ile-Ife. Chairman, Nigeria Association of University Students (NAUS), Eruobami Ayobami, while speaking with Vanguard, said the protest would be a daily routine until the government finds a common ground with the academic union towards funding university education appropriately. -Advertisement- The students created barricades on the highway, using used tyres and human shields while some of their leaders addressed motorists and passers-by.
