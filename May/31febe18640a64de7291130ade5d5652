Manchester United are preparing for another 90 minute attempt to climb their way back up the Premier League table this evening. The Red Devils have found themselves eight points from a Champions League spot after picking up only one win in their last six matches and will now face Brentford in what could be their last chance. Ralf Rangnick’s side have only three matches remaining and a defeat today would leave them scrambling for points against Brighton and Crystal Palace, whilst also relying on Arsenal and Tottenham to crumble. Meanwhile, Brentford have enjoyed superb form in the latter stages of the season and will prove very difficult opponents for United as they search for their sixth win from eight matches. Here is a round-up of the latest pundit predictions for today’s clash at Old Trafford. Michael Owen – Man United 1-0 Brentford “Now United have little to play for, I’m curious whether Ralk Rangnick will change the personnel. There’s a lot of promising youngsters at the club, now would be an ideal opportunity for them to get some game time ahead of the new boss coming in this summer,” Owen told BetVictor. “Brentford have had such a great season and can travel to Old Trafford full of confidence after that draw against Spurs. They’ve been very organised in recent weeks, and make it difficult for each side they face. POLL “I’m still going to pick United. Brentford will be difficult to break down, I’m going for 1-0.”
