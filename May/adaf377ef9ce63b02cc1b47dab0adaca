Erling Haaland’s contract details have been revealed after Manchester City agreed terms to a blockbuster transfer. Haaland’s summer move from Borussia Dortmund to Man City could be confirmed this week following months of speculation. The Premier League champions are set to trigger the €75 million (£64 million) release clause in the star forward’s contract, having reached an agreement on personal terms. -Advertisement- He’s expected to pen a five-year deal, keeping him at the Etihad until 2027. The 21-year-old will also become one of the club’s top earners, with reports claiming he’s set to pocket a massive £21 million a season. Given Man City are signing Haaland for at least half of his market value, they’ve agreed to put him in the same wage bracket as the likes of Kevin De Bruyne, Jack Grealish and Raheem Sterling. Haaland has been a serious goal-machine since joining Dortmund from Red Bull Salzburg in 2019. He has scored an incredible 85 goals in 88 appearances in all competitions. POLL He has 28 goals to his name this campaign, having bagged a remarkable 41 goals last season. Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp believes Man City’s expected signing of Haaland will ‘set new levels’ of competition. “I signed a new contract knowing that City will not stop developing. So it’s not about City to define if we can be happy or not, it’s about us,” he said. “If Erling Haaland goes there, it will not weaken them. Definitely not. “I know in the moment a lot of other people will talk about money, but this transfer will set new levels, let me say it like this.” Haaland will add firepower to Man City’s attack, with Pep Guardiola’s team operating without a genuine No.9 for the majority of this season.
