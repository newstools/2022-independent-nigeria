Ambassador Daniel Onoja, who leads the Omegapro Team in Nigeria, has asserted that as efforts to empower citizens and reduce poverty intensify globally, the need to embrace technology and use the power of the internet to break away from the shackles of poverty has become imperative. Speaking during a press conference held in Lagos to educate and enlighten Nige­rians on the need to depend less on government and cor­porate jobs, and engage digi­tal tools to create wealth and reduce the pains and agonies occasioned by the covid-19 pandemic, which led to many job losses and the collapse of many businesses across the world, Onoja said the Omega­pro platform presents a huge opportunity for citizens to diversify their resources into viable digital opportunities and achieve financial free­dom over time. According to Onoja, “Starting a traditional busi­ness with all the physical structures such as renting a building or renting an office space, paying staff and oth­er utility bills to run the busi­ness can be very demanding.”
