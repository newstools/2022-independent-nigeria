LAGOS – A national workshop on ‘The War Against Terrorism in Nigeria’ organised by the African Humanities Research and Development Circle (AHRDC), University of Nigeria, Nsukka (UNN), which brought scholars, stakeholders and other professionals together, has reflected on actions displayed in private and public spaces, motivated by some immediate and remote factors that have heightened insecurity within the country’s borders. These actions, they concluded, had led to loss of thousands of lives, both civilians and security personnel. They blamed the absence of balance and unbiased approach for the escalating war against insecurity everywhere in the country. -Advertisement- “The current gap between the academia and political leaders in Nigeria is a major factor undermining development and public peace. “Although Nigeria had since her independence six and a half decades ago experienced episodes of violence, rebellions, insurgencies and various degrees of criminal acts, not once has any of these or an accumulation of them defined us as is currently the case. “Thus, terrorism as currently experienced in the country tops the list of critical issues that require urgent intellectual and stakeholders’ attention. “Leaving it for too long at the discretion of politicians alone, and for election campaigns resulted in its widening so extensively in scope and manifestations.
