Darren Fletcher is expected to take on more responsibility for Manchester United’s recruitment once Erik ten Hag’s reign gets underway. Former Red Devils midfielder Fletcher was appointed technical director in March 2021 having returned to the club as a coach. He has survived the recent reshuffle which has seen senior scouts Jim Lawlor and Marcel Bout and transfer negotiator Matt Judge all leave. Judge was often charged with meeting targets and their representatives. And according to the Daily Mail, his departure has left a gap that Fletcher will fill, taking on a more visible role when it comes to new arrivals. The 38-year-old Scot knows just how far the club are away from their glory days having played under Sir Alex Ferguson from 2003-2015. He will be aiding Ten Hag, who is taking charge at the end of the season, in a massive summer re-build. There are plenty of decisions that need to be made first on the squad which Ralf Rangnick has at his disposal. The report claims Ajax boss Ten Hag is already in regular contact with Old Trafford chiefs and will have a key role in deciding who stays and who goes. Paul Pogba, Jesse Lingard, Juan Mata and Edinson Cavani are all set to be free agents within the next few weeks. And there is said to be no indication that the imminent United boss wants any of them to stay. Their exits will open up not only spaces in the squad, but also relieve the club’s mega wage bill, which is believed to be the preferred option as it would allow Ten Hag to recruit more heavily. After a very disappointing season, there are question marks hanging over the head of several other first-team stars. And returning loanees Anthony Martial and Andreas Pereira are yet to learn their fate too.
