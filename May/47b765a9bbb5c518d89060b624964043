Eddie Nketiah is Crystal Palace’s top striker target this summer, but The Sun reports that the Arsenal star now wants to join a Champions League club. The forward is still currently on course to leave the Gunners in the summer. Nketiah’s contract expires at the end of the season. And he has not agreed an extension. His stock has risen in recent weeks. Mikel Arteta handed the 22-year-old an opportunity, and he has shone at times. Nketiah scored two goals against Chelsea. -Advertisement- Martin Keown labelled Nketiah ‘magnificent’ after that performance as Arsenal won at Stamford Bridge. Nevertheless, it would still appear that he is set to seek a new challenge in the coming months. The Sun reports that Nketiah has set his sights on joining a Champions League club. Meanwhile, Crystal Palace have made Nketiah their top striker target. Nketiah looks set to be leaving Arsenal to secure regular game-time. And he has shown that he is ready for that step in his career with some superb performances. But it is a bit of a surprise to see that he wants to join a Champions League club. He is potentially not quite ready to start regularly at that level. So it may baffle many if he leaves Arsenal to be an understudy elsewhere – particularly if the Gunners finish fourth. POLL A move to Palace could make a lot of sense. The Eagles are on the up under Patrick Vieira. And there is an opportunity for a striker to come in and make themselves a key man. Staying at Arsenal could also be a sensible call. Arsenal do need a marquee striker. But if his form is a sign of what is to come, opportunities will definitely come his way in the future.
