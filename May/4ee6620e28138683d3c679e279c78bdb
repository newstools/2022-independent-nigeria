Justice Binta Nyako of the Federal High Court in Abuja has refused to admit the leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra, IPOB, Nnamdi Kanu to bail. Daily Post reports that the judge held that Kanu must account for his whereabouts for years when he was first granted bail but refused to attend court for trial. The court disagreed with the defendant that he escaped out of the country when a retinue of armed soldiers allegedly invaded his ancestral home in Abia State.
