Salisu Yusuf, the first assistant coach of the Super Eagles, has debunked the stories making the rounds that he had been demoted to the position of second as­sistant coach of the Super Eagles. The CHAN Eagles’ chief coach, while responding to questions from our corre­spondent on how he fared on his alleged demotion to second assistant coach of the national team, said he was yet to be contacted on that, saying he was hearing it as a rumour. “My brother, I am just hearing it; there is no offi­cial communication to me from the NFF regarding that. -Advertisement- “May be they will say it later if it is true but I am the first assistant coach of the Super Eagles for now. “We are doing things officially and I will expect the federation to reach me over this but they have not reached me, so I take it as a rumour,” he told SUNDAY INDEPENDENT. It will be recalled that stories were rife that Sun­day Dare, the Minister of Youth and Sports Devel­opment, had directed that Enyimba manager, Finidi George, replaces Coach Salisu Yusuf as the first assistant manager of the Super Eagles. This is coming two weeks to the international friendly matches between Nigeria and Mexico as well as Ecuador in the United States. A ministry source re­vealed to an online medi­um that Dare had given what seems like match­ing order to the NFF that George, who is currently in charge of the dugout at eight times Nigerian champions, Enyimba, be made the first Super Eagles assistant ahead of Coach Yusuf who has served as for eight years in that capacity. POLL The source further re­vealed that no reason was given by the minister to back his claim but had made it clear that Finidi be made the first assistant while Salisu, despite his years of experience, be the assistant of the former Ajax and Real Betis mid­fielder.
