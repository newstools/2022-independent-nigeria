ABUJA – A business mogul and presi­dential aspirant on the plat­form of the Peoples Democrat­ic Party (PDP), Mohammed Hayatu-Deen, has said that with sufficient checks and balances, Nigeria can compete with other countries of the world. Speaking when he paid a consultative visit on the PDP Caucus in the House of Repre­sentatives, Hayatu-Deen said that his greatest motivation for going into politics is not just to fix the economy, which is at the root of all of the problems, but to stop the ocean of blood flow­ing in the country occasioned by the activities of bandits. He said: “With sufficient checks and balances, we can actually make this country one of the greatest nations on the face of this planet. I would say without fear of contradiction, that my greatest motivation for going in is not just to fix the economy, which is at the root of all of our problems but to stop the ocean of blood, leashed in this country. It is mind boggling and it’s almost unbelievable. -Advertisement- “Nobody with a conscience will see our sons and daughters and their grandchildren and mothers and sisters and aunts and uncles being slaughtered all over the place.” The aspirant, who prom­ised to unlock the nation’s economy, added: “With my motivation, my background experience, and as somebody with a proven track record of transformation, I will go in and unlock that switch, turn it on again, and take this country to the stratosphere. “Nigerians are phenomenal people. The intrapreneurial energy that flows through the veins of Nigeria is unparal­leled. I can only compare it to the United States because the human intelligence in this country is unbelievable. But there are barriers that are hold­ing us back.”
