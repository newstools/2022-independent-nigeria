ABUJA – Senior Special Assistant to the President on Media and Publicity, Garba Shehu, has debunked a report alleging that the Media Sub-committee of the Convention Planning Committee of the All Progressives Congress (APC), spent N800 million on its publicity activities. Shehu, who served as secretary of the sub-committee, however, clarified that they only got N100 million, which was used to augment an initial budget of 360 Million. In trying to set the records straight, Shehu said the report in a national newspaper (not Independent titles) that the Media Sub-committee of the Convention Planning Committee of the APC led Abdullahi Sule, the Governor of Nasarawa State, co-chaired by Alhaji Lai Mohammed, the Minister of Information and Culture, spent N800 million was strange news and totally untrue. According to him, “If that huge amount of money was spent on media work at the convention, we make bold to say that we were and still are unaware of the what, who, when and how it was expended.” He explained that the subcommittee, on which he served as secretary, got N100 million only.
