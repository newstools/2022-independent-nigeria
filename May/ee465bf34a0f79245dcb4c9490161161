WARRI – Former Vice Chairman of Udu Local Government Council, Hon Onomuakpokpo John Tereh has expressed immense satisfaction with the outcome of the Delta State PDP gubernatorial primary election which returned Rt Hon Sheriff Oborevwori as winner in a landslide scale, noting that the development was a confirmation of his popularity and acceptance by Deltans. In a press statement he personally signed and released to newsmen on Sunday morning, the Ujevwu-born political tactician affirmed that the longest Speaker of the Delta State House of Assembly was a man of destiny, stressing that any watcher of Hon Sheriff Oborevwori ascendancy on the political ladder can testify that the man has a date with destiny and that nobody would be able to stop him in the general election because God Almighty had already make the way for him to step into government house in a manner that defile human understanding. “Those who wish to compete with the Rt Hon Sheriff Oborevwori are on a wild goose chase. This man came to the House of Assembly in 2015, in just two years time he became Speaker of the House. He was returned as Speaker in 2019, found favour with the powers that be and today he has emerged flag-bearer of the PDP. That is God at work. Sheriff Oborevwori will win and I am happy to be part of his political family. -Advertisement- “The Chief of Staff to the Speaker, Dr Ebenezer Okorodudu is my direct leader and I celebrate him also for this wonderful development. I therefore wish to appeal to all Deltans to join hands with Rt Hon Sheriff Oborevwori to build on the developmental milestones of the current governor for the progress of our dear state”, Hon Onomuakpokpo John Tereh added, appealing to all Udu sons and daughters not to waste their votes on other candidates outside the Speaker who, he added, would win handsomely in the coming polls.
