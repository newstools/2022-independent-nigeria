According to Adeyanju, Atiku’s action was shameful, adding that ambition cannot be more important than justice. Reacting, Adeyanju in a tweet on Thursday, wrote: “Shame on Atiku for deleting that tweet. Ambition cannot be more important than justice. -Advertisement- Shame on every politician & leader in the North that refused, failed or neglected to condemn the act. May God continue to bless our revered and respected Emir of Sokoto who was swift.’’ In another tweet, Adeyanju queried Vice President Yemi Osinbajo’s silence since the emergence of the issue. He tweeted: “At least Atiku even tweeted and later deleted after fanatics threatened him, what of VP Osinbajo- a so-called Pastor?”
