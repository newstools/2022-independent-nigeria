Nigerian Afrobeat singer, Seun Kuti, has revealed that the Yoruba Muslims are not different from Hausa Muslims as he claimed that the jihadists were only defeated in Yoruba land which led to the calmness experienced in the South. He disclosed this via his Instagram post while reacting to the gruesome killing of Deborah Samuel, a female student of the Shehu Shagari College of Education over the blasphemy of Prophet Mohammed. Kuti wrote, “YORUBA MUSLIMS AREN’T DIFFERENT, THEY ARE JUST DEFEATED. TWICE, IF AFONJA WON HIS WAR, THEY WILL BE DOING THE SAME HERE. WE BEAT THE CRAZY OUT OF THEM. -Advertisement- “Yoruba Muslims tried to Islamize us Twice. We fought 2 wars against the jihadist among us and we beat them well! They don’t have the military and political clout to misbehave! No one should act like their calmness is due to their choice. Na lie!!”
