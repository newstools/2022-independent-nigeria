Dr. Gbenga Abimbola, a uni­versity lecturer, has declared that the quick and only solu­tion to the nation’s current socio-economic and polit­ical challenges remained enthroning true federalism. The lecturer, who is of the Department of Mass Com­munication, Adekunle Ajasin University, Akungba-Akoko, Ondo State, dropped the hint in Akure, the state capital, at a public lecture and award organised by Sunshine Stan­dard, a community magazine. Abimbola emphasised that the concentration of too much power at the centre was detrimental to other tiers of government. -Advertisement- This, according to him, had led to infrastructural decay and destruction of dif­ferent sectors of the economy. He suggested that there should be devolution of pow­er and that state governments should be allowed to have con­trol of natural resources and pay tax to the central govern­ment. Dr. Abimbola, however, posited that all the federating nations should meet and dis­cuss on whether the marriage should continue or not.
