LAGOS  – The Federal Government has been advised to discard the idea of concessioning of some of the nation’s airports, rather the government is told to commercialise the aerodromes in order to make them commercially viable. Mr. Bankole Bernard, the Chief Executive Officer (CEO), Finchglow Travels in an interview with our correspondent in Lagos over the weekend, insisted that none of the Nigerian airports was unviable, but said the business plan by the government made them unattractive to investors. Bernard explained that most developed aviation countries have changed their business plans on airport development by shifting attention from the terminals and make them shopping malls in order to attract travellers to them. Since the aviation industry is international, Bernard advised the Federal Government to take a cue from these and concentrate energies on developing business plans that would attract users to the airports. For instance, he explained that the Baltimore/Washington International (BWI) Thurgood Marshall Airport in the United States despite its small size, the airport managers have made it active by consistently building infrastructure around it that attract users to it. Bernard queried the documents relied upon by the government to have concluded that the airports are unviable in Nigeria, maintaining that not only passengers traffic that makes an airport viable. To make the airports attractive, Bernard canvassed for the handing over of the terminals to investors, rather than concessioning them. He said: “Where is the document that revealed to any of us that those airports are not commercially viable? Are we looking at passengers as the only means that makes an airport commercially viable? As a matter of fact, let me tell you that airport terminals are no longer what they used to be.”
