Following the success of her 2020 body of work, ‘Restless II’, popular singer, Simi is set to release her album, ‘To Be Honest’, come June 3. The songstress made this known on her Instagram page when she posted a handwritten letter to her fans. In the letter, the singer and actress notes that she has been trying to tell a story for close to three years, being desperate to tell something to help her interpret the thoughts she’s thinking. “Then my child was in my arms. In the arms of a woman whose love was so great, that it swallowed her whole and left her unsteady. It confused me, but for some reason, for a season, I became less sure – of the stories I wanted to tell, of the way I wanted to tell them. I craved clarity. So again, I said, “not yet.” -Advertisement- “Months passed, and I believed the moment had come. I was certain it was the time and that the stars had finally aligned. “Eureka,” I thought. But when I listened, alone and in the dark, I didn’t feel right. It felt too much like my story was tainted by too many second and third-party opinions. Opinions and ideas I usually cherish and lean on – but not for this story. Just me, so again, I said “not yet.” “I paused my impatience, listened to only the voices in my head, trusted in only the instincts I was born with. Now, when I listen in the dark, or in all the places the sun likes to shine, alone or with everybody else, it feels right. Eureka,” she wrote. She finally noted that come the 3rd of June she will share this story with her fans finally.
