The Senior Pastor of Awaiting the Second Coming of Jesus Christ Ministry, Pastor Adewale Giwa, has condemned the gruesome murder of Deborah Samuel, a student of Shehu Shagari College Education Sokoto State who was alleged of making blasphemous statements about Prophet Muhammad. According to Pastor Giwa, any religion that kills to defend its prophet is not of God. He said, “Any religion that kills in the name of protecting or fighting for his messiah cannot be of God but of the devil. “And any religion that does not embrace peace, love, and tolerance belongs to the devil. Our God is a God of peace and justice. -Advertisement- “If you believe that your messiah has the power to fight for himself, why are you fighting for him? The pastor also berated former Vice President Atiku Abubakar, who is also a presidential aspirant on the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), for deleting his earlier comment which frowned on the ugly incident. He said, “To the issue of Atiku Abubakar that reportedly deleted his reaction on the unfortunate incident. I have something to say to him because God has a way of exposing a selfish leader who always thinks about himself and ambition. “I have always known that Atiku cannot be a good president that Nigerians can rely on. He is just desperate for power like the outgoing President Muhammadu Buhari.“In case they produce him as a PDP candidate, then only religious fanatics will vote for him. “And other aspirants are not talking because they are looking for votes from religious fanatics, more importantly from the northerners. And the north is the area where they manipulate election results from. POLL “So they are looking for a good number of voters that can vote for them during the 2023 election. That is why they are silent. I have always said that the country was established for Fulanis.”
