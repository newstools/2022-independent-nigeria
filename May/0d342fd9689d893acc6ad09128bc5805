The agent of Gabriel Jesus has confirmed that talks have been held over a possible transfer to Arsenal this summer with the move a ‘possibility.’ Despite enjoying another strong season and becoming a regular in Pep Guardiola’s starting XI in recent weeks, Jesus’ future has been cast into doubt. That’s due to the arrival of Erling Haaland in the coming weeks, with Manchester City confirming they have agreed a £51million deal with Borussia Dortmund to sign the Norwegian sensation this summer. Jesus has been at City since 2017 but for the vast majority of his stint had to play second-fiddle to Sergio Aguero in the attacking pecking order. The Brazilian may have hoped that he would finally get a prolonged spell leading the line upon Aguero’s departure last summer but that hasn’t been the case. -Advertisement- Instead, Jesus was converted into a winger and, after failing to sign Harry Kane last year, Haaland has now been brought in to replace the iconic Argentine’s ridiculous goal output. As a result, speculation is growing that the 25-year-old could depart the Etihad this summer, with his contract currently set to expire in 2023. Arsenal has emerged as the front runners as they are in need of a striker with Alexandre Lacazette and Eddie Nketiah both out of contract upon the end of the season. Marcelo Pettinati, Jesus’ agent, has revealed that he his client likes the project under his old coach Mikel Arteta.
