The Publicity Secretary of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Lagos State Chapter, Seye Oladejo has assured that he would make life more meaningful and abundant for residents of Mushin Federal Constituency 2 if he is given the opportunity to represent them in the Federal House of Representatives. Oladejo, who spoke through a short video made available to newsmen over the weekend, noted that the kind of representative Mushin Federal Constituency 2 needed at this critical time, is a man who would be the people’s representative in the true sense, be visible to the people and be in a position to be accountable for all his actions in the House. While explaining that he had come a long way in party politics and governance in Mushin Local Government, the APC Publicity Scribe, who has indicated interest to vie for the Mushin 2 Federal Constituency seat, said, “As you all know we are facing unusual challenges and I dare say that we are in unusual times. “This means that we need to put our best foot forward, we need to elect a representative that is capable, competent, passionate, experienced and would bring back home the proverbial dividends of democracy. “A representative that would be our representative in the true sense of the word, a representative that will be visible to the people, one that will be discerning and that will be in a position to be accountable for all his actions in the House of Representatives. “For this reason, therefore, I am heeding the clarion call from all and sundry to come forward to serve at this level in order to make life more meaningful and more abundant for our people.” He further explained that he started politics as a young man and therefore knows the yearnings of the youth, just as he’s aware of what the not so young need. “As you all know, I started a young man, so I know the yearnings of the youths and I have also come a long way to interact with the not so young to know their expectations of a responsible and responsive government. POLL “At this point, I want to appeal to you all to support me on this journey that will take us to the Mushin Local Government of our dream,” he added.
