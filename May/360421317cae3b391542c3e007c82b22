Explaining their support for Odupitan at a press conference in Abuja, SSYCGG noted that he’s a result – oriented leader who can lead Nigeria in 2023. Addressing newsmen, the Convener /Coordinator of the group, Aigbomian Smart said, “we are tired of years of political rhetoric’s by our professional politicians who have proven since independence time in and time out that they don’t have the capacity and desire to address the challenges facing us as a nation. -Advertisement- “That despite the current level of stagnation, there is seeming desperation by overly ambitious politicians to dominate the stage. But beyond these sharks, there are Nigerian professionals and business tycoon with proven records of good management of men and resources and the capacity to obliterate or, at least minimize conflicts in their domains. But they constitute a fraction of our current political leaders. “It is high time Nigerians use an alternative political platform to mobilize Nigerians to vote for good governance. “It is our belief that this nation, more than all else, needs a true game-changer with past experience of tackling crisis situations – whether political or economic. “That there is an urgent need for professionals who are successful in their chosen careers to contest the highly exalted seat of President to fix the country from years of retrogressive development by Professional politicians. “That Chief Samson Abiodun Odupitan should be supported to take a shot at the 2023 Presidency as someone with a proven record of good humanitarian and resources management.”
