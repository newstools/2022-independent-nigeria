The midfielder has endured a mixed Anfield career following his 2017 arrival from Arsenal. His debut season under Jurgen Klopp turned him into a force to be reckoned with – especially for Manchester City. However, a serious knee injury in May 2018 saw him miss most of the subsequent 2018/19 campaign. Despite playing regularly in Liverpool‘s Premier League title-winning season, Oxlade-Chamberlain has never got back to his previous heights. And with only one year left on his deal, Liverpool do not want to lose him for nothing. -Advertisement- Indeed, the Daily Mirror now reports that the Reds are ready to listen to offers for the 28-year-old. West Ham and Villa are therefore on alert over a potential summer deal. Villa boss Steven Gerrard, a former midfielder himself, is a big fan of Oxlade-Chamberlain. Hammers boss David Moyes is also looking at the Englishman as a key signing to bolster his ranks. The newspaper adds that Liverpool, who signed Oxlade-Chamberlain for £35million, will ask for more than £10million for him, but will accept a loss. The 35-cap England international has fallen down the pecking order under Klopp at Liverpool. POLL He has not played since March 20 and is highly unlikely to feature in Saturday’s Champions League final, Liverpool’s last game of the season. His best recent chance for game time amid Liverpool’s trophy push was arguably Southampton away earlier in May. Klopp made nine changes, but Harvey Elliott, Curtis Jones and James Milner started in midfield instead. Oxlade-Chamberlain was an unused substitute and Jones and Elliott, while in some ways still representing the future of Liverpool’s midfield, are also an important part of the present.
