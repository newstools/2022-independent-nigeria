Offices of the Nige­rian Civil Aviation Authority (NCAA) and the Nigerian Air­space Management Agency (NAMA) offices at the Murtala Muhammed Airport (MMA), Lagos were on Monday pick­eted by industry unions. Also, offices of the Nigeri­an College of Aviation Tech­nology (NCAT), Zaria and the Nigerian Meteorological Agency (NiMET) at the in­ternational wing of the La­gos Airport and others were put under lock and keys by the members of the unions, an action, which prevented workers from gaining en­trance to their offices, but did not disrupt flight movements. However, the unions on Monday night cut short their two days warning strike to one, claiming appeals from well-meaning Nigerians and organisations for its decision. -Advertisement- The unions, however, said that their aim was not to stop the airlines from flying as Air Traf­fic Controllers (ATCs) were not members of the striking unions. The unions had embarked on the warning strike to en­sure implementation of the Condition of Service (CoS) for their members in the af­fected agencies. The unions also alleged that the operating airlines are presently flying blind as none of them could obtain weather report from NiMET and other necessary information from NAMA, even though ATCs were not part of the action. But, the unions; Nation­al Union of Air Transport Employees (NUATE) and the Amalgamated Union of Public Corporation of Pub­lic Corporation Civil Service Technical and Recreational Services Employees (AUPC­TRE), assured that flight services may be disrupted today (Tuesday) following the inability of airline operators to obtain weather forecast for their flights from NiMET. Comrade Ocheme Aba, the General Secretary, NUATE, in an interview with our corre­spondent in Lagos, said that the warning strike recorded 100 per cent success as their aims and objectives were achieved. POLL Aba told Daily Indepen­dent that the airlines were able to operate on Monday because they had filed their flight plans and obtained weather forecasts from NiMET as on Sunday and very early on Monday, but expressed that the situation may change the next day.
