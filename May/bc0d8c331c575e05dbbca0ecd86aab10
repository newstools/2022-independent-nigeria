The UK has imposed sanctions on Russian President Vladimir Putin’s former wife and his alleged current girlfriend over the invasion of Ukraine.Lyudmila Ocheretnaya, who was married to the president until 2014, and former Olympic gymnast Alina Kabaeva, face UK travel bans and asset freezes.The UK has now placed more than 1,000 people on its Russian sanctions list.Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said Britain was “tightening the vice” on Mr. Putin’s “inner circle”.The UK was “exposing and targeting the shady network propping up Putin’s luxury lifestyle”, she said, and would “keep going with sanctions on all those aiding and abetting Putin’s aggression until Ukraine prevails”.Ms. Truss said sanctions against Russia should only be lifted when all of its troops had left Ukraine. Earlier, she told a meeting of G7 foreign ministers in Germany that allies should go “further and faster” in supporting Ukraine’s resistance.She said President Putin must face a defeat that prevents further aggression – but some analysts have warned this stance may make a political settlement harder.Earlier this month it was reported that the EU planned to sanction more Russian individuals, including Ms. Kabaeva.Since Russia invaded Ukraine on 24 February, thousands of civilians and combatants have been killed or injured, and some 14 million people have fled their homes, with more than six million seeking refuge abroad.
