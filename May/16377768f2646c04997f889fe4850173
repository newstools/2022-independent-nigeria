Yemi Ijaodoro, the group stated that Nigerians are waiting for Tinubu. -Advertisement- It begged the delegates not cut short the wishes of the people. The group added that having carefully extolled Tinubu’s visionary leadership qualities, forthrightness, and uncommon courage, he would surely lead Nigerian youths and the nation to greater heights and out of economic peril. It described the former governor as a caring leader who would take the interest of all citizens at heart, irrespective of their ethnic or religious affiliation. “Tinubu loves Nigeria and he shows it in his own little way mentoring different leaders across the region. “We wish to appeal to all APC governors, lawmakers, present and past party leaders, stakeholders and members of the party, and our humble delegates, to support the candidacy of Tinubu to ensure that he emerges as the flag bearer of the APC for the 2023 presidential election.” POLL The group also wish to invite all Kano state stakeholders to a dinner slated for 25th May 2022 at BON hotel Kano by 6pm.
