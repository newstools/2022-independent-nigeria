Nigerian gay rights activist and HIV/LGBT advocate, Bisi Alimi, has stated that the Human Immune Virus (HIV) doesn’t kill, only the stigma, the shame and the discrimination does. Alimi disclosed this on Wednesday while celebrating 18 years of living with the disease as he celebrates his 47th year birthday, urging people to get tested and know their HIV status. He wrote, “Eighteen years ago, at the National AIDS conference in Abuja and with nudging from friends, I walked into a testing booth for the first time. -Advertisement- “I walked out with HIV-positive test result. Two years before then, I had just lost my best friend to AIDS, and he was around 26yrs. “I have been living with HIV since I was 29, this year I clocked 47. Between 2004-2009, I kept quiet about my HIV status cos of shame and stigma. “Then I realised, HIV doesn’t kill, it is stigma, the shame and the discrimination that does. Here is to 18yrs of positivity and many more years to come. Please get tested today.”
