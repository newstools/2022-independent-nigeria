The Igbo socio-cultural organization, Ohanaeze Ndigbo, has warned the former Anambra State Governor, Peter Obi, and all other 2023 presidential aspirants against considering the position of the Vice-President in the 2023 election. The President-General of Ohanaeze Ndigbo Youth Council Worldwide, Mazi Okwu Nnabuike, disclosed this on Wednesday in a statement, urging them not to be accepted as a ‘spare tire’. He said, “Speculation has been rife that Mr. Peter Obi, Okwute Ndigbo has accepted to be Atiku’s running mate and we cannot ignore it again. -Advertisement- “This is why we are sounding a note of warning that neither Obi nor any other Igbo man or woman should jettison this project. They should not accept to be a spare tire anymore. “No Igbo man should be cajoled out of this race because we are part and parcel of this country. If it is otherwise, this is the time to let us know and we will take our fate in our hands. “We are saying for the umpteenth time that both the APC and the PDP should micro-zone their presidential tickets to the South-East. Anything short of that is unacceptable.”
