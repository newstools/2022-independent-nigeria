Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola is set to sign a contract extension with the Premier League leaders, despite his side’s dramatic exit from the Champions League on Tuesday. The Citizens headed into their semi-final second leg with a 4-3 advantage over Real Madrid, and looked certain to progress to the final when Riyad Mahrez put the visitors 1-0 in Spain. But then came one of the most dramatic comebacks in football history, as substitute Rodrygo scored twice after the 90th minute to send the tie to extra time. -Advertisement- City were visibly shellshocked, and things went from bad to worse for the English side when they conceded a penalty, which Karim Benzema duly dispatched to put Real ahead for the first time in the tie. The hosts then held on to secure a remarkable victory and book a place in the final against Liverpool later this month. Guardiola has failed to win the Champions League since leaving Barcelona Guardiola, meanwhile, looked dejected on the touchline as his side once again fell short in Europe. Despite their premature exit, it appears that the Spaniard is still set to be offered a contract extension. POLL As per The Star, the former Barcelona boss will sign an extension that will keep him in Manchester until 2025. Guardiola’s current deal is set to expire in 2023, but with City leading the Premier League table it appears that those in charge at the club have been suitably impressed. The ex-Bayern Munich manager had been heavily linked with an exit from City when his current contract expires next summer, but he is reportedly relishing the chance to work with Erling Braut Haaland, who is expected to sign from Borussia Dortmund this summer. The Norwegian is believed to be close to agreeing a £67 million move to Manchester, and Guardiola believes that the striker could make the difference for City in their failed European campaigns.
