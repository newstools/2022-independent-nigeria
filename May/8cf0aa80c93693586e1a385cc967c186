Nollywood actress, Adesua Etomi-Wellington, is holding down for girls who like to keep their looks simple. The actress who says that she has worn cornrows a lot lately on purpose noted that she is her most authentic self when she wears braids, plaits or when she wears my hair out. “If you’ve followed me closely, you’d know what I mean. You’d know this isn’t new. In general, I believe in keeping it simple. Whether it’s from my clothes to my hair, to my lifestyle. I’m saying this cause every now and then someone tries to turn the word ‘simple’ to mean something negative as though it’s something I should be ashamed of. “So I, Adesua Etomi-Wellington, am out here, holding it down for the simple girls. Or the ones who rock cornrows every now and again, the minimalists. I hope you look at me and feel pride knowing that these rows our ancestors wore are still a thing to be proud of. -Advertisement- “I hope you see me and rock yours with pride if you want to but above all, may you know that you are more than your hair no matter how you choose to wear it and more than your clothes, no matter what styles you choose to wear. “I do this for the girls deemed ‘too simple’. There is not a single thing wrong with simplicity. We may be ‘simple’ but there is not a single thing simple about us. Raise your glass if you are a SG,” she wrote on Instagram. She further noted that it isn’t about style and hair as much as it is about being oneself. “Saying this so you stop questioning who you are. Embrace it. It’s ok. It’s more than ok, It’s great,” she added.
