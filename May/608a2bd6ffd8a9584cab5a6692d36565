LAGOS – Struggling Heartland Foot­ball Club of Owerri put up a resilient performance as they overcame neighbours, Abia Warriors in the Oriental der­by decided at the Dan Anyiam Stadium in Owerri. The Naze Millionaires shot to the front first in a match that produced three goals inside the first 35 minutes of the encoun­ter. Murphy Ndukwe shot the former CAF Champions League finalists in front in 23 minutes and Nonso Nzedieg­wu made it two two minutes later. But veteran forward, God­win Obaje, reduced the score line for the visitors in the 35th minute, as the home side held strongly and waved off attacks from the visitors to claim the whole three points. Despite the result, both teams are down at the rele­gation zone with Heartland sitting on the 17th spot with 28 points from 26 games while Abia Warriors are a step down­load with 27 points from the same number of games played. In Ilorin, Kwara United came from behind to beat the league leaders, Rivers United, 1-0, in a result that did little to affect their position as they remain four points clear at the summit. In the results of other games played, Katisna United, playing at home, piped reigning cham­pions, Akwa United, 1-0. Lobi Stars defeated Nasarawa Unit­ed 2-1 at the Aper Aku Stadium, even as Remo Stars got past Wikki Tourists 1-0 in Remo, Abeokuta. In Akure, Sunshine Stars and Shooting Stars shared the spoils as both teams fired blank. Similar result was re­corded in the match between MFM and Enugu Rangers in Lagos. Despite the results, Rivers United maintain their four-point lead on the table after Plateau United suffered a loss in one of the games played on Saturday. They lost 1-0 to Dak­kada FC in Uyo. POLL From the rear, MFM are calling the shot on the 20th spot and are followed by Kano Pillars on the 19th place.
