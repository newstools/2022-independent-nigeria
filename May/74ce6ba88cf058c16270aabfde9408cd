LAGOS  – Patrick Pascal, the team coor­dinator of the Super Eagles, has called for support for the newly appointed manager of the national team, Jose Paseiro. The Olympics gold medal­ist with the national U23 side in 1996 said much as Nigerians would have wanted another one or two other managers out there in preference to Paseiro, there was the need to lend sup­port to the Portuguese. The former Turkey based professional footballer, while in a chat with our correspondent on the appointment of the high­ly travelled Portuguese manag­er, said the football house might not be able to afford the services of some of the coaches Nigeri­ans were yearning for in the team, noting that the money paid to the foreign managers might seem much here but small when they take it abroad. -Advertisement- “Some of the coaches some people are calling the NFF to employ may not come quite easy and cheap. “They went for the coach they can pay easily and that is the most important thing. “When you look at the mon­ey they (foreign managers) are paid here, you think it is that big because you are looking at it from Nigerian currency. “But when they spend it over there, it is not that big; be­sides, these foreign managers come with one or two assistant whom they pay from the same amount. “So given all these, the NFF went for a coach with experi­ence and whom they can pay with relative ease.
