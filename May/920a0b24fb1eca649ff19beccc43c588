OWERRI  – Imo State Hoteliers Association has again cried out to Governor Hope Uzodimma over the activities of illegal and unauthorised suspended Revenue Consultants who allegedly connive with some corrupt judicial personnel to secure Garnishee Orders. Chima Chukwunyere, Chief Servant of the Association told newsmen in Owerri that the Association is armed with recent irrefutable Garnishee Orders issued by some personnel of the judiciary with the banks of such hotels formally serve with it. According to him, on December 2, 2020, there was a connivance between Revenue Touts and some personnel of the judiciary in sealing Hotels’ Accounts (Garnishee Order) without due process which imposed excruciating hardship on the Hotel industry in the state and resulted in the laying off of a number of staff. -Advertisement- “But when we cried out to Governor Hope Uzodimma for intervention, he promptly hearkened to our plea and ordered the immediate disengagement of all Revenue Touts in the state and that the money they had already collected without due process should be returned”. Chukwunyere said that when the former chairman of the State Internal Revenue (IIRS) – Emeka Udegbulem assumed duty, he ignorantly recalled the sacked Revenue Touts and who began to deal ruthlessly with the Hotel industry with impunity through extortion and corruption, conniving with some staff of the judiciary and securing court judgement without due process of the law and concealing same until the period given for appeal elapsed. “He gave approval for Hotels to pay money into private Accounts and when we cried out, governor Uzodimma removed him and replaced him with Dr. Ifeanyi Okeke – a Chartered Banker and Accountant who also suspended the nefarious activities of all Touts masquerading as government Revenue Consultants as directed by the governor”. The Imo state Hoteliers Association boss however expressed surprise that the sacked Revenue Consultants are still in business, conniving with some personnel of the judiciary to secure judgements through the back door despite being suspended by the state government. He commended the governor for suspending the Revenue Touts for the second time, assuring them through the State Internal Revenue Service (IIRS) that “the Egyptians we see today, we shall see no more”. –
