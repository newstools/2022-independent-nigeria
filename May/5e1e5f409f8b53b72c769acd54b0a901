Manchester United midfielder Paul Pogba is an option for Manchester City this summer as Pep Guardiola looks to strengthen his squad. Speculation over Pogba’s United future continues to swirl and a recent report from the Daily Mail suggested the Frenchman could move to United’s cross-city rivals. MEN Sport understands Pogba is merely one possible central midfield target that Guardiola and City could pursue this summer. After coasting to their third Premier League title in four seasons, City were priced out of a move for England striker Harry Kane last summer, but they did manage to sign Jack Grealish from Aston Villa. His signature saw City break the nine-figure barrier to set a new British transfer record of £100million. -Advertisement- Kane continues to be mooted as a potential target for the upcoming window. However, priority number one is Borussia Dortmund striker Erling Haaland. As for Pogba, the expiration of his deal this summer means City would not have to pay a transfer fee if he were to move to the Etihad. Fernandinho’s imminent departure and Ilkay Gundogan’s niggling injury issues this season mean Guardiola could be tempted to hunt for midfield reinforcements.
