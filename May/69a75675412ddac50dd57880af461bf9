The Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board (JAMB) has charged examination officials to ensure that all the report forms on the conduct of the examination are filled accurately and completed as at when due. The information gathered from the forms would assist the board in establishing happenings during the examination for reference purposes as well as serve as evidence for punitive measures. The Director of Quality Assurance, Mrs. Mabel Agbebaku, gave the charge at the training for staff ahead of the 2022 UTME recently. -Advertisement- The Director, who was represented at the training by Deputy Director, Archives, Records and Library Services Division, Mrs. Temi tope Akintola, stressed the importance of accurate filling of examination reports by officials stating that information harvested from the reports would assist the board in the event of complaints from stakeholders. Mrs. Akintola said Post-UTME sorting of reports is done twice yearly after the Mock and after the main examination. She said, “All Examination Officers should fill their forms accurately by indicating their Centre Number and Session on the form. All sessions must be reported separately. Do not use one form to report the two or three sessions held daily. Continuing, she said, “AIl forms should be arranged according to sessions in the following order: Supervisor, Technical, BVR, Resident Monitor, CPN (CCTV), Proctor, Centre Administrator and Centre Technical Officer forms. “Other forms include payment made to Centre Owners, Daily Attendance, Unverified Candidates and Malpractice, all of which are to be packed separately.”
