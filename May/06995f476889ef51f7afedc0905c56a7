Sanctions placed on departing Roman Abramovich by the UK Government have seen the billionaire’s assets frozen as part of the response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. This has vastly limited spending at Stamford Bridge, leaving it up to the first team staff to lend a hand for the travelling youngsters. Asked if that was the case, Tuchel said: “That’s what we did. It’s a big competition, and it’s one club. -Advertisement- “Normally the club would buy these tickets and provide them for the parents and players of the academy. So we stepped in and bought the tickets for them.” Chelsea will take on Liverpool at Wembley – a match that is live on talkSPORT – for the second time in four months after their Carabao Cup loss to the Reds in February. The game comes amid the backdrop of lasting ownership uncertainty, which appears close to its end with US businessman Todd Boehly agreeing to purchase the club. The sanctions imposed on the club have already resulted in the departure of star defender Antonio Rudiger to Real Madrid. Speaking of his departure, Tuchel said: “I don’t think anybody likes it. He gives everybody confidence in the dressing room. POLL “He is a unique character and plays on an outstanding level. He sometimes takes the focus towards him, he loves responsibility. “Nobody likes this decision but we have to accept it. Like it or not there will be life at Chelsea after Toni. It is also the most important thing for us that it ends like it started, on the highest level.”
