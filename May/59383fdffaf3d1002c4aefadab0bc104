Arsenal are reportedly the most interested club when it comes to Napoli midfielder, Fabian Ruiz, who could leave the Italian club this summer. According to reports from Napoli Piu, Arsenal are said to be the team who hold the highest interest in the midfield star, who has long been tipped for a move elsewhere. Ruiz, 26, has won the Coppa Italia in Naples and was part of Spain’s successful under-21 team a few years back. With Napoli, he has been a regular for some time now, making more than 160 appearances during his time in Italy. Of course, interest in Ruiz is nothing brand new when it comes to English clubs. Newcastle were said to have prepared a £40m bid for the Spaniard just a few months back, and the Toon could well revisit that plan in the summer window. -Advertisement- Napoli are keen to get good value for Ruiz should he move on. However, they’re now in a tricky situation, given Ruiz’s current deal expires in 2023. Arsenal are firmly in the mix for a new midfield player this summer. And while a number nine remains their priority, there is money for Mikel Arteta to spend in other positions. Ruiz is very much between the number eight and number six positions we often here about in modern day football. He isn’t afraid to put his foot in where it hurts and protect the defence. But on the reverse, he is more than capable of getting a goal as well. Ruiz has seven this season, and 22 overall for Napoli. Arsenal need to get it right this summer in terms of their signings. There are some good players out there to be had, it just depends on how hard they push. Certainly, Fabian Ruiz would tick more than one box.
