An aide to Former President Goodluck Jonathan has just dissociated his boss from the N100 million Nomination form, which he said was simply bought in his name. Jonathan, who was President from 2010 to 1015 before he was defeated by the incumbent President Muhammadu Buhari and his All Progressives Congress (APC) in 2015, is seen as a leader of the opposition People’s Democratic Party (PDP), the platform under which he was president. In a telephone chat with Prime Business Africa shortly after the news of his alleged payment of N100 million for the APC nomination form broke, Jonathan’s spokesman, Ike Eze, said: ”Don’t mind them; they are on their own.” -Advertisement- There is still uncertainty regarding whether the former President actually made the payment by himself or through other APC members clamouring for a Jonathan ‘Presidency’ in 2023, especially as he has not officially left the opposition PDP. Impeccable sources in Heritage Bank confirmed to PBA that payment of N100 million payment was made on behalf of the ex-president for Nomination Form and Expression of Interest Form in two tranches on Monday, but failed to confirm if it was done directly or by proxy.
