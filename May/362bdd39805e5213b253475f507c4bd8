Former Governor Peter Obi of Anambra State has ex­tolled Nigerian health work­ers especially the nurses and midwives who, he said, were a critical part of primary healthcare delivery in the country. Obi, in a message to com­memorate the 2022 Nurses’ Week, stated that the nation re­mained grateful to the health workers, especially at the pri­mary level, for their sacrifice throughout the period of the coronavirus pandemic till the present moment, and for en­suring that the nation enjoyed better health. He reiterated that the health sector, being a very critical contributor to de­velopment in any nation, deserves government’s atten­tion and firm support. He stat­ed that aggressive investment in training of health workers should also be prioritised by the government. -Advertisement- “As studies continue to point to the impending scar­city of nurses and midwives globally, to the tune of 10 mil­lion by 2030, I urge the gov­ernment to invest more in the training of health workers, especially nurses and mid­wives. By doing so, we can produce many hands to care for our teeming population, and have enough to export globally,” Obi noted. Recalling his days as the governor of Anambra State, Obi stated that he met a health sector already on life support, but with the right vision, investment and com­mitment, great milestones in development were achieved in that sector.
