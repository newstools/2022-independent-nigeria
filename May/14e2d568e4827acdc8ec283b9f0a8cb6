The Southwest Security Stakeholders Group (SSSG) has commended the Lagos State Governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu on the recent ban on the commercial motorcyclists also known as okada riders in some parts of the state. SSSG noted that the move by the state government became necessary as a measure against unscrupulous okada riders perpetrating crimes in the state. While applauding the move, the group in a statement by its Publicity Secretary, Adewole Ireti, also urged Sanwo-Olu to extend the ban to other areas in the state, even as it urged other Southwest governors to take a cue from the move in order to rid the region of bad elements that are ready to disrupt the peace in the south-west. -Advertisement- “Last week, the Southwest Security Stakeholders Group had earlier raised the alarm over the influx of non-Nigerians coming to the southwest to cause unrest. However, we are happy that the Lagos state governor acted on our request, which I think is commendable. “We urge other governors in the southwest to do the same in order to ensure effective security across the region. The crimes being committed by some criminal okada riders in recent times have been worrisome. “Even in some northern states, they have been banned and many of the law-abiding riders have been infiltrated by these criminals, but the best we could do to avoid further crimes is to strengthen our security architecture. “For instance, in Lagos, the influx of these non-Nigerians has created a lot of security challenges across the state. Every day, we hear stories of crisis emanating from these riders and also leading to loss of lives and destruction of properties. “Things cannot continue like this, therefore, we are applauding the Lagos state governor for this move and also urging his counterparts in other states in the southwest to do everything that is possible to prevent chaos in the region,” the statement added.
