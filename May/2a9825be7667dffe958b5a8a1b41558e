Awka  – The Anambra State government has described as misleading, a publication in a national newspaper (not Daily Independent) in which the newspaper insinuated that some people were killed based on their religious background. In a statement signed by the Press Secretary to the Governor, Mr. Chris Aburime, the government said much as there is general insecurity across the country, there is no targeted religious or ethnic killings in Anambra State. It said: “As a matter of fact, Anambra indigenes have suffered more casualties as a result of the unfortunate killings. The insensitive slant of the report, the statement said, “Have the tendency to stir anger and disaffection in other parts of the country. -Advertisement- “The report, therefore, is totally unacceptable and inimical to the unity and progress of the nation. “Government of Anambra State hereby states that the report is not only sensational but misleading and should be immediately retracted to reflect the real situation on ground”. It said it is on record that Ndi Anambra and people of the North and other parts of the country who live and do business in the state, not only share common values, but have always lived at peace with each other in the state. Governor Soludo’s administration, it continued, has not only demonstrated commitment in tackling insecurity but has continuously reassured both indigenes and non-indigenes in the state of their protection and safety.
