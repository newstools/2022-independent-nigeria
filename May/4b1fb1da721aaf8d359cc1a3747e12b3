As presidential aspirants continue to emerge across the six geo-political zones ahead of the 2023 Presidential election, Bishop David Oyedepo of the Living Faith Church Worldwide, popularly known as Winners Chapel has said contesting to be Nigeria’s president is a demotion for him. Speaking during a leadership summit transmitted worldwide, Oyedepo while charging the church workforce on the need to be devoted to serving God noted that he’s called for a global impact. According to him, although he believes in Nigeria, it’s too late for him to contest the highest political position in the nation. -Advertisement- The 67-year-old cleric’s statement may not be connected to a number of pastors who have come out to obtain presidential nomination forms in a bid to become the country’s number one citizen which includes, Pastor Tunde Bakare of Global Citadel Community Church and Vice-President Yemi Osinbajo who is a pastor of the Redeemed Christian Church of God (RCCG). Speaking, he said, “I believe in Nigeria and that is why I am still here, and still praying for Nigeria. But I  consider it a demotion if I am invited to become the president of Nigeria. I am called for a global impact. I saw this in 1984. “Even the devil knows that you can’t be genuinely sold-out to serving God, and not stand out in life. Since 1976, I have never missed a change of story,” Oyedepo said. He added, “I was 19 years old when I prayed to God not to let me leave a village the way I met it. So I was 19 when I encountered destiny. I have not been tired going out for God since 1976”. He urged members of the church to pray for the grace to be released on them for global impact for Christ.
