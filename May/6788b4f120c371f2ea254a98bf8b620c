ADO-EKITI – Some angry landlords whose proper­ty were demolished by government to pave way for the construction of new Bus Terminus in Ado-Ekiti have cried out for compensation. The affected landlords who are residents of Ijoka Quarters, the State capital, on Thursday staged a peaceful protest demanding compensation for over N82.6 million worth of property consumed by the project . They vowed not to guarantee the safety of the contractors at the site if government fails to accede to their demands. -Advertisement- The protesters claimed to have wait­ed in vain for over four years without any tangible action from government towards compensating them. Spokesman of the aggrieved land­lords, Mr. Afolabi Ogunsakin, lament­ed an alleged nonchalant posture to pay their compensation, after being evicted at short notice . He said, “Our dear ancestral home was demolished in 2016 by the state government without consideration for hardship and negative effects that we experienced. “All negotiations regarding pay­ment of compensations to members had been fruitless. After several ap­peals, it became clear that govern­ment was not ready to pay us our entitlements. It is also clear that delay in payment of our entitlements was deliberate. “The community wants to state cat­egorically here that henceforth, step would be taken to disturb workers on site. We are ready to damn the conse­quences until the government pays us our entitlements.” POLL The Head of the family, Chief Laisi Opokiti, regretted how they were be­ing allegedly deceived by government, saying, “Many tombs where our forefa­thers were buried were leveled during the demolition. We know that their spirits will fight.
