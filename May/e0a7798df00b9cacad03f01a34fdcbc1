Kalvin Phillips has confirmed he’s happy at Leeds and is confident he will renew his contract when the time is right. MEN Sport revealed last month that Phillips is a target for United as they look to strengthen their central midfield department. Last week, MEN Sport reported that the Yorkshire club were confident of keeping hold of their star player, despite the ongoing speculation. Leeds are hopeful United will not be able to meet their valuation of the midfielder. Phillips’ contract expires in 2024 and the Leeds man has now addressed the speculation surrounding his future at Elland Road. -Advertisement- He told BBC Radio Leeds : “I’ve made what I want to do clear. I’ve made my intentions clear. I want to be at Leeds and I’ll focus on that until my contract ends. I’m not really worried about it too much. “It’s always been something I’ve been confident about sorting whenever it needs sorting. There’s always going to be noise when you’re an England international and you’re playing for one of the biggest teams in the country, and I think until the end of the season, I’ll be happy at Leeds and always will be.”
