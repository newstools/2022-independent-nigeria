LAFIA – A coalition of youth groups in Nasarawa state under the aegis of Youth Group from Lafia/Obi Federal Constituency, on Friday, canvassed support for women’s participation in politics for gender balance in governance. Yarwa Ahmad, the Chairman of the group, made the call during a press conference in Lafia, the state capital during the Endorsement Ceremony of a 36-year-old female aspirant, Hauwa Ibrahim, who recently joined the race to represent Lafia/Obi Federal Constituency at the House of Representatives, on the platform of the All Progressives Congress (APC). Ahmed noted that since 1999, the constituency have never had a female representative at the National Assembly which was why they were supporting the aspirant to emerge victorious given her experience and antecedents in the public and private sectors. -Advertisement- He said, “Over the year, we have lacked women’s participation in politics. We know that women are good managers as we can see in our homes and if they are given the opportunity to serve in governance, Nasarawa state and indeed entire Nigeria will be a better place for all of us. “Women’s participation in politics will also create a gender balance in governance because we are aware that men have taken over the politics of Nasarawa state. This is why we the youth of Lafia/Obi Federal Constituency have gathered to show our support to Hon. Hauwa Nana Ibrahim for her ambition to represent us at the House of Representatives in 2023. The group, however, appealed to the delegates to vote for Hauwa Ibrahim during the party primary in order to have gender balance for more dividend of democracy to strive.
