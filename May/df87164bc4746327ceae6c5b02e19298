LAGOS – Some Senate and House of Representatives aspirants seeking to contest in the 2023 general elections under the platform of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) have lamented the lack of coordination by the party’s National Working Committee (NWC). Speaking with DAILY INDEPENDENT on Friday, some of the aspirants who are currently in Abuja said that based on the party’s timetable, they were meant to start their screening on Friday but there has been no information from the party leadership. They said the inability of the party to stick to its timetable has made it difficult for them to plan their other activities. -Advertisement- According to one of the aspirants from Kano “This party is so disorganized. They made rules but can’t just stick to them. We all left our respective states and came to Abuja for screening. Based on the timetable, the screening is supposed to start today but nobody is talking to us”. “Their lack of coordination is really affecting us because we can’t plan our other activities. If they shift the date by one or two, that means we have to stay longer in Abuja and yet, we are paying bills for hotels and other spendings.” Another Reps member from Enugu said they will storm the National secretariat on Saturday to register their displeasure. “We have all agreed to go to the party secretariat tomorrow. Somebody needs to talk to us on what is responsible for the delay.”
