YENAGOA – The University of Port Harcourt (UniPort) Alumni Association has applauded the political aspirations of some of its members who are contesting various elective offices at the federal and state levels in the 2023 general elections to render service to the society. The association, in a statement issued by its national president, Williams Ule Glad, on Sunday, said the positive political disposition of its alumni was a reflection of the impactful training provided by their alma mater. According to him, members of the UniPort alumni body “have continued to make positive contributions to the politics, governance, economic and social prosperity of their home states and the country at large.” -Advertisement- Ule listed some of the alumni as the immediate past Minister of Transportation, Rotimi Amaechi, Minister of State for Petroleum Resources, Timipre Sylva, Rivers State Governor, Nyesom Wike, a governorship aspirant in Abia State, Alex Otti. He recalled that former President Goodluck Jonathan, also an alumnus of the university, while in office, performed creditably well and selflessly handed over the baton of leadership, stressing that Nigeria is still enjoying his peaceful exit from office. Ule described UniPort as a great institution that had remained a brand of pride in learning, creativity, character and leadership. He further said, “It is commendable for Uniport Alumni to present themselves for service as the country transits fully into the (2023) electioneering year.” “Nigerians should be rest assured of effective representations under the leadership of any Uniport Alumni.” POLL Ule also commended the current Vice-Chancellor of UniPort, Professor George Owunari, for providing an enabling teaching, learning and research environment for students and lecturers. He also called for peaceful general polls in the country next year and the quick resolution of the ongoing face-off between the Federal Government and the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU).
