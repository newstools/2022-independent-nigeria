LAGOS – The Lagos State University Teaching Hospital (LASUTH) Pediatric Seminar Room and Doctors Call Room on the first floor of the ward now have a new look, courtesy of Ikeja Golden Lions Club who made the upgrade its core project. The club’s project, the general upgrade of the facilities, which was recently commissioned, was initiated to ensure that the care givers/ doctors of the pediatric centre are comfortable and be able to give their best. Speaking during the commissioning, Kayode Oshinuga, the Lions Club District Governor, agreed that the facilities would enhance the users’ productivities. -Advertisement- “We can see that their call rooms are now conducive, the care givers and doctors of the pediatric centre can relax their bodies, brains and attend to these children much more properly. If they are not comfortable, they will certainly not be able to give their best,’’ the district governor said. Prof. Idowu Senbanjo, Head of Department, Pediatrics, also said improving the care/welfare of doctors and nurses in the ward would definitely go a long way and having a direct impact on the care of children that use the facility. ”We see enormous number of children in this department going to thousands, about five thousand every month. So, what the Ikeja Golden Lions Club has done will impact on not only children in Lagos State but even children that come from the neighbouring states, Ogun State and other states from the East and the North,’’ said Prof. Senbanjo. Also, Lion Sidikat Balogun, past President of Ikeja Golden Lions Club/ Co-Chairperson of the activity, added that the purpose of the activity was for the doctors; so they can serve the children better as they deal with children with special needs and suffering from cancer.
