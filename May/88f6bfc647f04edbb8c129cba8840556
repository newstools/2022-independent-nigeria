Former Senator Shehu Sani has said that the resignation of Senator Enyinnaya Abaribe from the opposition Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, is a setback. Abaribe had earlier today dumped PDP and resigned as the Minority Leader in the upper chamber of the National Assembly. He gave ‘illegality, impunity, and hesitations in decision-making’ as reasons for dumping the PDP. -Advertisement- Reacting to this Shehu Shani on Twitter wrote, ”Senator Enyinnaya Abaribe’s reported resignation from the PDP is a serious setback to the opposition. ”He is an outstanding lawmaker and a strong voice for justice, equity, and accountability. It is unfortunate that the Abia issues couldn’t be solved amicably.”
