China’s foreign minister has met with the leaders of Samoa in his third stop of an island-hopping tour aimed at deepening Chinese ties with Pacific nations. The two sides signed an economic and technical cooperation agreement, a handover certificate for an arts and culture centre and the Samoa–China Friendship Park, and an exchange of letters for a fingerprint laboratory for the police, the Samoan government said. Australia and the United States are closely watching the 10-day trip by Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi, fearful that China could be laying the groundwork for an eventual military presence in the region that would extend its reach further into the Pacific. -Advertisement- China said its development of economic and security ties with Pacific nations does not pose a threat to others.
