John Terry paid tribute to Liverpool winger Luis Diaz after watching his former side suffer defeat in the FA Cup final. Chelsea lost to Liverpool on penalties for the second time this season at Wembley, following February’s Carabao Cup showpiece, in what was a hard-fought contest on Saturday afternoon. For the Reds, it was their second of a potentially unprecedented four trophies this season. But for the Blues, it was their fourth defeat in the last six FA Cup finals. -Advertisement- One player who caught the eye against the Chelsea, both on Saturday and back in February, was Luis Diaz, whose pace and direct play proved too hard to handle on a number of occasions. Although unable to get on the scoresheet, the Colombian was a constant threat and more than played his part in asking questions of the Blues backline. Terry was quick to recognise the efforts of the 25-year-old when speaking after the FA Cup final, writing the following message on an Instagram post shared by Diaz: “Absolutely devastated, but you are a fantastic player my friend.” This is not the first time the ex-Chelsea captain has singled out the former Porto man for praise, however. After watching the Reds’ January recruit in action earlier this season against West Ham United, he said: “Diaz is a player.”
