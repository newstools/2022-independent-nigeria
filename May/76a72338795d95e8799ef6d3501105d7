A non-governmental organization (NGO), Gender Mobile Initiative (GMI) is set to sign a partnership agreement with the Government of Ondo State to end sexual assault in institutions of higher learning in the state. According to a statement signed by Ms Omowumi Ogunrotimi, the Executive Director of GMI, the group said sexual assault in Nigeria’s higher institutions has witnessed an all-time high with associated negative outcomes for victims. Ms Ogunrotimi said the “partnership is happening on the strength of the political will demonstrated by the Ondo State Government through the Offices of the Special Adviser on Gender and Special Adviser on Education aimed at building institutions that are safe for everyone to thrive.” -Advertisement- She highlighted the scope of the partnership as one that will strengthen the internal mechanisms of institutions to combat sexual assault as a systemic issue through innovative policies, community-led bystander intervention and creative integration of technology to enhance institutional accountability, promote access to justice, generate data and ensure effective case management. She revealed that they are in partnership with individual institutions and as such this partnership with the Ondo State Government is highly commendable because the State Government is taking ownership of the process while facilitating Gender Mobile’s support to institutionalize prevention. Gender Mobile Initiative is partnering with not fewer than 107 institutions of higher learning with the support of the Ford Foundation to combat the remote and proximate cause of sexual harassment in institutions of higher learning. Ogunrotimi further stated that the partnership with the Ondo State Government entails “providing technical support to institutions to develop comprehensive anti-sexual harassment policies, capacity strengthening of the Campus community on bystander intervention and the deployment of the Campus Pal Mobile App to promote survivor-centred reporting and effective case management.” The partnership is expected to subsist for three years during which, parties anticipate significant impact and success stories.
