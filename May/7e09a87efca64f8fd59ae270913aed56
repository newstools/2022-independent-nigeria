LAGOS – As reactions continue to trail the gruesome murder of Deborah Yakubu by her fellow students, for alleged blasphemy against Prophet Mohammed, former Federal Minister of Solid Minerals, Nigeria, Dr. Oby Ezekwesili has declared that both her killers and the entire school’s authority are culpable, guilty of the crime. Reacting to the video of the murder which has since gone viral on social media, Ezekwesili noted that for the school authority to have folded its arms while Deborah was being lynched right in the school’s premises, both the perpetrators of this evil act and the school management have a case to answer. She wrote on her official twitter page @obyezeks, “I just watched a horrific video of a student identified as Deborah of Shehu Shagari College of Education in Sokoto being beaten and burnt to death by some young people for ‘religious blasphemy’. And not ONE among the school authority intervened? They and her killers have a CASE.” -Advertisement- See tweet below; I just watched a horrific video of a student identified as Deborah of Shehu Shagari College of Education in Sokoto being beaten and burnt to death by some young people for 'religious blasphemy’. And not ONE among the school authority intervened? They and her killers have a CASE. She added that late Deborah has joined a list of unfortunate victims who must be given justice. “Deborah sadly joins the Long List of those who must be given Justice in this Land someday; no matter how long it takes for us to build a society where human life is respected and accorded dignity. Her “religious” killers will surely account. Someday. On earth and before God.” See below; POLL Deborah sadly joins the Long List of those who must be given Justice in this Land someday; no matter how long it takes for us to build a society where human life is respected and accorded dignity.
