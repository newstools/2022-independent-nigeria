Liverpool star Mohamed Salah has been accused of disrespecting Real Madrid ahead of the Champions League final by Los Blancos forward Federico Valverde. Jurgen Klopp’s side head into this weekend’s clash hoping to exact revenge on their Spanish opponents – having been beaten by them in the final four years ago – but Valverde claims his team have extra motivation too. Earlier this month Salah insisted that he wanted Liverpool to face Madrid in the final rather than Manchester City, and although he explained that retribution for 2018 was the motivation behind it, Valverde didn’t take it well. -Advertisement- “Obviously they’re [Salah’s] words that everyone can take however they want, [but] I’m his opponent and it’s like disrespecting the Real Madrid badge, the players,” the 23-year-old said. “The only thing we must do is give our best, try to show why we’re in the final and let’s hope we can give another trophy to the fans and to Real Madrid,” Valverde added. Salah was forced off with a shoulder injury just half-an-hour into the 2018 final, and could only watch on from the sidelines as Loris Karius’ implosion effectively handed the title to Madrid, and despite eventually getting his hands on the trophy 12 months later, the Egyptian clearly believes he has a few ghosts to lay to rest. Carlo Ancelotti’s Madrid side have had something of a rollercoaster European campaign, having produced three late comebacks in a row to inch past Paris Saint Germain, Chelsea and Manchester City. Comparatively, Liverpool have had a much easier route to the final, having seen off Inter Milan, Benfica and Villarreal.Victory in Saturday’s final will see the Reds land their third trophy of the season having been narrowly pipped to the post by Pep Guardiola’s City side on a wild final day of Premier League action – denying them the chance of an historic quadruple.
