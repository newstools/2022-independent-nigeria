DANIEL ABIA, FRANCIS ONOIRIBHOLO P/HARCOURT / BENIN – The former Vice President and the presidential aspirant of the Peoples’ Democratic Party (PDP), Alhaji Atiku Abubakar, has called on members of the party to ensure that they are more united than before, even if the outcome of the forth­coming presidential primary does not favour some persons. He said this was the only way the party could win the general elections and take over power from the APC which, he said, had destroyed what was left of the country. -Advertisement- Atiku, who was in Port Har­court, the Rivers State capital on Saturday to meet with the delegates, said the PDP had been in opposition for seven years now, still counting and could not afford to remain in opposition after 2023. He said while he held so much respect for other presi­dential aspirants who had also shown enormous interest to contest for the sole ticket of the party, he had more capaci­ty, experience and enough con­nections to win the election so that PDP could return to pow­er after the All Progressives Congress (APC’s) eight years on the saddle. In Benin, he flayed the cur­rent APC administration of President Muhammadu Bu­hari for championing religion and ethnicity in his appoint­ment of persons into various positions in the country. Atiku, who expressed his displeasure when he met with Edo State national delegates in Benin City, preached unity, saying that he would restore and proffer solutions to oth­er problems confronting the country. “Today, if you are not from a certain part of the country or religious faith, nobody looks at your face. This is criminal. I have what it takes to unify this country and I humbly submit to do it,” he pledged. POLL “I want to assure you that PDP will lift Nigeria from bot­tom to top. There are institu­tions established by our PDP administration.
