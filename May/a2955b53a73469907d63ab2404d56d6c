The Islamic Movement of Nigeria (IMN), on Monday, alleged that operatives of the Nigeria Police Force, Kaduna State Command arrested 78 of its members. Representative of the group in Kaduna State, Yunusa Lawal Musa, stated at a news briefing, in Kaduna, on Monday, that one person was killed when the police attacked the procession. According to him, the group was processing in Zaria during the International Quds Day when they were attacked. -Advertisement- Musa described the police attack and arrest of its members as; barbaric and uncivilized; at a critical moment of insecurity and dissension. He said that 70 members of the group were arrested in Zaria while eight were arrested in the Kaduna metropolis on April 29, 2022. Musa said the attack also led to the killing of one of their members; a 28-year-old Mustafa Abubakar Wagini. He wondered why the police used live ammunition and tear-gassed their members, even as the procession was armless. The IMN rep explained that the constitution of Nigeria guaranteed freedom of Religion as enshrined under sections 38 (1) and section 40, adding that their lawyers were already working to secure their release. POLL He appealed to all Nigerians to prevail on the government to stop the attacks and to unconditionally release the passports of their leader, Shaikh Ibraheem El-Zakzaky, and that of his wife, Zeenatu Zakzaky. The Kaduna State Police Command Public Relations Officer, ASP Jalige Mohammed, did not pick up his calls, just as he did not respond to text messages sent to him.
