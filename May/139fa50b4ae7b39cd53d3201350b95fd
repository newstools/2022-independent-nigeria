LAGOS – Governor Babajide San­wo-Olu has finally been en­dorsed as the standard-bear­er of All Progressives Congress (APC) in the 2023 gubernatorial election in Lagos State, with his Dep­uty, Dr. Obafemi Hamzat, approved for a second term in office by the APC Na­tional Leader, Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu and the en­tire members of the Lagos State chapter of the APC. At the party’s stakehold­ers’ meeting held at Ad­eyemi Bero Auditorium in Alausa on Friday, Tinubu physically raised the hands of Sanwo-Olu and Hamzat in approval of their bid to con­tinue in office beyond 2023. This development puts all rumours surrounding the recent endorsement of Sanwo-Olu for a second term by the Governance Advisory Council (GAC) to rest. -Advertisement- Tinubu’s endorsement of Sanwo-Olu and Hamzat has also laid to rest the specula­tions in some quarters, es­pecially some online news platforms few days ago that the APC National Leader dumped Sanwo-Olu for a for­mer Permanent Secretary in the Lagos State Civil Service, Mustapha Olorunfemi. Tinubu said the Gover­nor and his deputy have built an unbreakable team to raise the bar of excellence in governance and service delivery in the State, with visible achievements and progress to show for their ef­forts. This, the APC National Leader said, earned the duo the opportunity to return for a second term, and not a blank endorsement which many politicians sought. Tinubu, a leading presi­dential hopeful on the APC platform, said Lagos under Sanwo-Olu’s leadership had remained a State of pride for residents and other Nigeri­ans who crave responsive governance and progress.
