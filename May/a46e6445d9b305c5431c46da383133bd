According to Spanish publication Sport, Everton have registered an interest for Barcelona striker Depay. Apart from Everton, Arsenal and Newcastle United are also keen on the Dutchman who is the joint leading top scorer this season with 13 goals. Arsenal have asked about Depay’s situation as they search for replacements for Alexandre Lacazatte and Eddie Nketiah who are set to depart at the end of the season as free agents. Depay has some Premier League experience which makes him an attractive candidate for Arsenal. The Toffees won’t be able to compete with the likes of Arsenal or Newcastle if they fail to ensure Premier League football next season. In fact, a fire sale may occur so the first and foremost goal should be to win against Crystal Palace. -Advertisement- Depay faces uncertainty at Barcelona as the arrival of Robert Lewandowski and the presence of Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang may make things complicated for Depay. Capable of playing on the left, Depay may have to compete with Ansu Fati. In the event of a sale, Everton will have to do a lot of convincing to secure Depay as a successor to Richarlison or Calvert-Lewin should one of them leave the club in the summer.
