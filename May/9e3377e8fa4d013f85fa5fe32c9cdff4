AWKA – The release of the final list of cleared aspirants for the Anam­bra State House of Assembly primary election by the All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA) shows that Amandi Chibuzor Emeh has replaced ex-Governor Willie Obiano’s aide, Ifeanyi Aniagor, for the Njikoka 2 state constituency seat. Emeh, who scaled through the hurdles of the APGA screening process, told journal­ists in Awka that he was sure of victory at the polls, but he also believed very strongly that delegates from his constituency would repose confidence in him as well as support him through the primary election to enable him win APGA ticket for Njik­oka 2 constituency contest. Emeh said: “We are major stakeholders of the party and we have been working for the party in our own way. -Advertisement- “We have a work plan for our people. We have markets in my constituency and these markets need to be expanded. These markets need govern­ment attention to make them meet the demands of modern day markets. “We also have other infra­structural needs in Njikoka 2 constituency. If we have the mandate of our people to repre­sent them at the 8th state assem­bly, Abagana, Nimo and other communities will once again feel government presence. “We believe we are going to scale through the primary elec­tion because government will be a bigger platform to actualise our work plan for the people.”
