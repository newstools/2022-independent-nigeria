Russia’s Victory Day military flyovers were abruptly canceled in Moscow and in at least two other major cities that are due to hold parades to commemorate the national holiday. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters on Monday that the air portion of Moscow’s Victory Day parade in the city’s Red Square had been canceled “due to the weather,” Russia’s state-run news agency TASS reported. According to local weather forecasts, Russia’s capital will see light rain showers and a moderate breeze until 7 p.m. local time.
