UMUAHIA – Against the increasing external loans being borrowed by the Federal Government, the Anglican Communion has advised President Muhammadu Buhari to desist from further borrowing and think of purposeful ways of stimulating the economy on the path of sustainable growth. The church made the plea in a Communiqué issued at the end of the 2nd Session of the 10th Synod of the Diocese of Umuahia, Anglican Communion, held at St. Andrew’s Church, Ndukwe/Amobi, Ubakala North Archdeaconry, Umuahia South Council Area of Abia State. According to the Communiqué jointly signed by Venerable Okwukwe N.B.C. Ucheagwu, Clerical Synod Secretary and Rt. Revd. D.D. Geoffrey Obijuru Ibeabuchi, called on the Central Bank of Nigeria to halt without further delay the strangulating depreciation of Naira against other international currencies and the choking interest rates regime that has kept the real sector of the economy prostrate. -Advertisement- The synod described the external borrowing “as mindless borrowing and accumulation of debt upon stringent terms and conditions that generations unborn will find difficult to repay. “Genuine and urgent steps should be taken to repair the four refineries in the country as it is a colossal economic waste, and indeed unsustainable, to keep importing finished refined products at astronomical international prices.” The Synod called on the Federal Government to provide an enabling environment for wealth creation and employment of Nigerians while urging all players in the Electricity Generation and Distribution matrix should wake up and serve Nigerians’ with light. “The frequent collapse of the national electricity grid due largely to inexplicable and avoidable reasons, while tariffs are at the same time constantly reviewed upwards and enforced without regard to the sensibilities of Nigerians, are not sustainable,” the Synod said.
