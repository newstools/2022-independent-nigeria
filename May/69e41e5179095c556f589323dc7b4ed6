Luis Suarez was moved to tears after being subbed off in his final home game for Atletico Madrid. The 35-year-old striker will leave the club at the end of the season once his contract expires, having spent two years in the Spanish capital. Suarez started in the 1-1 draw to Sevilla on Sunday before he was substituted off in the 65th minute. He received rapturous applause as the Wanda Metropolitano faithful rose to their feet, with chants of “Uruguayo, Uruguayo” bellowing around the 68,000 capacity stadium. But the send off proved to be too emotional for the legendary South American forward. -Advertisement- As he left the field, TV cameras captured Suarez sobbing after taking in the tribute from supporters and clapping them. He was then seen crying on the bench. After the game, he was given a guard of honour by Atletico Madrid players, along with midfielder Hector Herrera, who is also leaving the club in the summer. Suarez’s emotional departure comes after his 21-goal debut campaign helped Atletico clinch the league title in the 2020/21 season. And despite that tally dropping down to 11 this season, his manager Diego Simeone remained highly complimentary of his competitiveness and goal-scoring prowess. Simeone said: “He came to try to remain at the top, to show how competitive he is. He helped us, and we helped him to win La Liga where he was decisive due to his forcefulness. “This season, despite not playing the games he would have wanted, he is still the team’s top scorer. I wish him the best, with absolute gratitude to an extraordinary footballer and to a person who goes beyond a footballer.’ POLL However, Suarez’s run at the top of Spanish football may not be be coming to an end just yet, with Jose Alvarez Haya of El Chiringuito reporting he could be set for a shock return to Barcelona. Having previously spent six years with the Catalan club, the Spanish outlet claim Barcelona manager Xavi is willing to accommodate his former teammate on a lower salary.
