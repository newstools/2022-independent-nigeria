LAGOS – Alliance of Yoruba Demo­cratic Movements (AYDM), an alliance of some 121 dif­ferent Pan Yoruba groups has advised the presiden­tial aspirants in the South West to prune down the number of aspirants to at least two candidates, stat­ing that the multiplicity of candidates may rob the region the slot of the Pres­idency in 2023. The group, in a state­ment signed by Popoola Ajayi, AYDM’s General Secretary, said the North­ern leaders in the APC ap­pear to have designed the architecture that will lead to the South West political waterloo in the coming pri­mary slated for the end of May. “There is a conscious attempt to set the South West against itself. With some six aspirants contest­ing on the All Progressives Congress, (APC) alone, the prospect of the next Pres­ident emerging from the South West is dim,” the statement reads. -Advertisement- AYDM also called on the South West leadership to employ credibility and public acceptability as the yardstick to arrive at a consensus candidate, stat­ing that the people of the South West should prepare to move to another politi­cal party if the APC failed to produce a presidential candidate from the region.
