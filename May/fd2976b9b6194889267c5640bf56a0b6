A mammoth crowd of the University of Benin (UNIBEN) students on Wednesday, took to the Benin City streets in protest against the ongoing strike embarked upon by the members of the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU) which has entered Day-80. The protesting students reportedly blocked the ever-busy Benin-Ore-Sagamu-Lagos Expressway, the University’s main gate and the Ring Road at the heart of Benin City, the Edo State capital. The protest, Daily Independent learnt led to a gridlock on the highway for hours. -Advertisement- The situation was said to have forced motorists to scamper in search of alternative routes. The students were seen at the campus entrance chanting solidarity songs holding placards with inscriptions such as “FG, Settle ASUU”, “Enough is Enough”, and ‘End ASUU strike’. The angry students were reported to have defied a downpour to register their bitterness against the continued strike by their lecturers who seem for now to have jettisoned every empathy for their learning and, of course, their future.
