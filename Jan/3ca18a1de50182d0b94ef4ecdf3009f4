Minister of State, Labour and Employment, Festus Keyamo SAN, has revealed that Nigeria benefited from the suspension of the microblogging site, Twitter, as all the conditions were met by the app to lift the ban. Recall that President Muhammadu Buhari on Wednesday lifted the suspension on Twitter after over seven months, revealing that Twitter agreed to legally register its operations, including taxation, and managing prohibited publications in line with Nigerian laws. According to Keyamo in his first Twitter post on Thursday after the suspension was lifted, Nigeria is eventually better off for all the FG conditions to which Twitter agreed. Twitter Agreed To Pay Tax, Establish Office In Nigeria, FG… ‘Election Fast Approaching’, Nigerians Say In Reaction To FG… He wrote, “For those who prioritised politics over patriotism and exhibited disingenuous righteousness on Twitter suspension, they can now see that with all the FG conditions to which Twitter agreed, Nigeria is eventually better off for it. Congratulations Nigeria.”
