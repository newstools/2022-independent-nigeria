The indications are that no formal offer has yet been made, but Arsenal are interested in signing the goalkeeper ahead of this month’s transfer deadline. Turner, 27, has played for New England Revolution in Major League Soccer since 2016. He has also made 13 appearances for the United States national team, starting in all six games the nation played at the 2021 CONCACAF Gold Cup.

Leno, 29, was Arsenal’s first-choice goalkeeper for three seasons after his £22.5 million arrival from German side Bayer Leverkusen. But Leno has been forced to sit on the bench ever since the arrival of England international Aaron Ramsdale, who was signed from Sheffield United. Ramsdale made a superb start to the 2021-22 campaign and has been Mikel Arteta’s number one ever since. It was previously thought that Arsenal would retain Leno until the end of the season, but the German may now be granted a move away if Turner can be signed to provide cover for Ramsdale.
