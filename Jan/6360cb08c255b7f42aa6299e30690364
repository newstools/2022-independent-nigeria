He said, “Despite what we are passing through now, I know that with the resilience of our army and cooperation from the populace, there will be light at the end of the dark tunnel. “This is not the time to agonize and cry over spilt milk, but a time to come together and organise in order to confront the monster of insecurity running riots across the country frontally in order to achieve economic prosperity,” he said. He added, “I also commend President Muhammadu Buhari and the effort of his administration to birth a new Nigeria despite daunting challenges of insecurity and COVID-19 pandemic.” The traditional ruler also urged the political leaders to close ranks and manage the country’s diversity in a way that will help the country blossom, pointing out that Nigeria is stronger as a United country.
