The KPMG survey ranked banks using the six pillars of customer experience excellence, including integrity (being trustworthy and engendering trust), resolution (turning a poor experience into a great one) and expectations (managing, meeting and exceeding customer’s expectations. The others were empathy (understanding the customer’s circumstances to drive deep rapport), personalization (using individualised attention to drive emotional connection) and time and effort (minimising customer effort and creating frictionless processes). POLL In a statement on the survey report, KPMG said, “This year’s leaders show digital banking excellence and have adapted well to higher transaction volumes and complaints.” Ademola Adebise, the Managing Director/CEO, Wema Bank, while commenting on the bank’s KPMG ranking, said it was an affirmation of the bank’s commitment to the growth and well-being of SMEs as critical contributors to the economy. He said: “At Wema Bank, we recognize SMEs as an important part of the economy, and we are always on the lookout for their well-being. We are happy that the SMEs acknowledge our contributions, hence our ranking”Speaking further, he stated that recognitions such as this are an invitation to do more.
