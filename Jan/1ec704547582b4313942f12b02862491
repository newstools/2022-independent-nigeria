Wolves held off a late Southampton fightback to seal a 3-1 victory over the Saints on Saturday afternoon at Molineux. The hosts took the lead eight minutes before the interval when they were awarded a penalty following a foul by Jan Bednarek on Rayan Ait-Nouri. Raul Jimenez coolly dispatched the resulting spot-kick. Conor Coady then doubled Wolves’ lead with a close-range header after Max Kilman’s initial effort had come back off the post. James Ward-Prowse got one back for the visitors late on with a thunderous free-kick, but Adama Traore broke clear late on to wrap up the three points for Bruno Lage’s side.
