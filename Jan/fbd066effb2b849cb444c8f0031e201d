The Ohanaeze Ndigbo Youth Council Worldwide, OYC, has commended the High Court for ruling in the favour of Mazi Nnamdi Kanu. A High Court sitting in Abia State had awarded N1 billion against the Federal Government of Nigeria over the invasion of Nnamdi Kanu’s country home. The President-General of OYC, Mazi Okwu Nnabuike, reacting to the judgement, said the decision of the court showed that there was still hope in Nigeria.

It is highly reassuring and commendable. “It shows that we still have courageous members of the bench in Nigeria who are ready to follow the law and apply it without pandering to the left or to the right. “We have always said that the military invasion of Nnamdi Kanu’s home was uncalled for since his court case was upcoming before that incident. “Our advice to the Government is to seek a political solution as suggested by the judge because that is the only way out and if the government is sincere to restore peace, it should not shy away from it.’’ “We have all seen that justice can still come by following legitimate means,” he added.
