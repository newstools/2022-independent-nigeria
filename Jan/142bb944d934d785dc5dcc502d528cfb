Chief Segun Osoba, for­mer governor of Ogun State and chieftain of the All Progressives Congress (APC) has said that major Government Reservation Areas (GRA’s) in Nigeria were developed by late Chief Ernest Shonekan, former Head of Interim Na­tional Government (ING) through UAC. Osoba in an interview on Arise Television on Wednes­day said that even after Shonekan was kicked out of office as head of Interim Gov­ernment (ING) after 93 days in office continued to contrib­ute to the development of the country, stressing that his leg­acy was more in the economic sector. “Today there are many skyscrapers developed by him as chairman of UAC. The UAC is the baby of Royal Niger Company, the company that the British government ceded Nigeria to. They virtu­ally developed most areas in Nigeria, Ikoyi in Lagos and other Government Reserva­tion Areas (GRA’s) through­out the country.
