The taste and style of the Ooni of Ife, Oba Adeyeye Ogunwusi tells a lot about his person. A flamboyant man no doubt, he has had to assume the image of being conservative as a result of his title. The monarch attracted a lot of unnecessary attention when his third marriage was speculated to have failed towards the end of 2021. Olori Mariam Lawal Rises In Prominence About Akinwunmi Adesina’s Aura The situation went from bad to worse after his wife Olori Silekunolami Naomi announced that she was done being with him, seeing many unconsciously muttering the word ‘not again’. Amidst the controversies that surrounded the marriage were later talks of a resolution, as the Olori who reportedly stormed out of the palace was said to have reconciled with her husband and returned after a reconciliation meeting involving the elders of Ife Kingdom and those of Ondo State, where Olori Naomi is said to hail from. Interestingly, amidst the whole face-off, the Ooni has maintained a sealed lip about the status of his marriage, even as many questions the position that both man and wife have resolved their differences, and the queen has returned to the palace. Since the supposed resolution of their marital differences, the monarch and his queen have hardly been spotted together.
