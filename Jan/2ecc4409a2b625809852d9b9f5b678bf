ABUJA – Justice Inyang Ekwo of the Federal High Court Abuja has fixed March 8 and 14 to deliver judgments on the multiple suits filed by the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) seeking the removal of Ebonyi State Governor Dave Umahi and his Deputy, Dr Kelechi Igwe, from office. Specifically, the PDP wants the duo who won the election on its platform to be removed from office on account of their defection to the All Progressives Congress (APC). Justice Ekwo fixed the dates after counsel in the suits marked FHC/ABJ/CS/ 920/21 and FHC/ABJ/CS/ 1041/21 had adopted their briefs of arguments for and against the suit.
