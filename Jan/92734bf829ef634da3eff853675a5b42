Ralf Rangnick spoke with Anthony Martial about his comments claiming the Manchester United forward refused to be selected for their Premier League match at Aston Villa. Rangnick said after United’s 2-2 draw on Saturday, Martial, 26, had declined the opportunity to be named in the squad in the absence of injured duo Marcus Rashford and Cristiano Ronaldo. Premier League clubs are permitted to name a maximum of nine substitutes and United only named eight at Villa Park – with two of them goalkeepers Dean Henderson and Tom Heaton.

Rangnick did not backtrack on his comments that Martial ‘didn’t want to be on the squad’ but said the matter was now closed. “I’m here now for six weeks, all the things that need to be said I said after the press conference,” Rangnick said. “I had a conversation with him on Sunday, a personal conversation with him about what happened and how I saw the whole situation, the matter is now resolved. POLL “He didn’t train yesterday and the day before yesterday. He will probably train today and after training, I will then take the decision if he is nominated or not. But let’s see what will happen then.” Martial joined United in 2015 from Monaco for a fee rising to £58million but has been a peripheral figure since the start of last season. The France international is under contract at United until 2024 and the club has the option of an additional year.
