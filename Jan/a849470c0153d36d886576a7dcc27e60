The Lagos State Project Coordinator for the World Banks assisted Agro-Processing, Productivity Enhancement and Livelihood Support (APPEALS) Project, Oluranti Sagoe-Oviebo, has said that the project has trained no fewer than 80 fish farmers and fabricators on easy steps and techniques of producing canned fish. In a chat with Daily Independent, she said the training was done in conjunction with the National Institute of Oceanography and Marine Research (NIOMR). She said the participants were trained on basic techniques for canning fish which ranges from temperature for boiling fish, preparation of tomato sauce, temperature for canning the fish and pasteurisation among others.

Sagoe-Oviebo also stated that some investors who are interested in setting up of such factories have been identified and would immediately swing into action anytime from now. “We deliberately took some fabricators with us for the training and they have looked at the different equipment. The equipment is quite expensive, so we are looking at a way in which they can locally fabricate some of these equipment so as to be affordable to our farmers and investors. “One of the fabricators has almost finished the machines and we are trusting God that as soon as he is done with fabricating the machines, we will look at what he has done and quite a number of our investors would be able to adopt the machines on their own.”
