Roma midfielder Jordan Veretout, who has proved to be an integral member of Jose Mourinho’s season plans so far, is being linked with a move back to the Premier League, according to reports in Italy. Reports from outlets La Gazzetta dello Sport and Il Tempo dictate that the French box-to-box midfielder is on his way out of the Stadio Olimpico, with Antonio Conte-led Tottenham Hotspur in pole position to sign his signature. The Frenchman’s links with Spurs arrive days after the arrival of Porto loanee Sergio Oliveira and Ainsley Maitland-Niles from Arsenal. Ex-Juventus sporting director Fabio Paratici, who now heads executive functions at Spurs, is reportedly a fan of the French midfielder.

He has 27 appearances for the Giallorossi this season, scoring 4 goals and providing 8 assists for this campaign. With his contract expiring in June 2024, earlier reports of negotiations over a potential contract renewal have ceased in recent weeks. Both Roma and Veretout’s stance are not yet known. He has made 108 appearances for Giallorossi since moving in 2019, scoring 22 goals in the process.
