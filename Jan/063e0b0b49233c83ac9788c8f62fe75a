Gbenga Ogunbote, the coach of Remo Stars, has relieved the un­derdog tag ascribed to the Sky Blue, saying it suited them well going forward. The coach, who has managed such tested NPFL sides like Eny­imba, Rangers and Sun­shine Stars, said he had always told his wards to remain positive in all matches. “They call us under­dogs because we are a new team in the league. Just like I did say, we won’t be carried away. Alalade Relieves Form With Shooting Stars Akwa Utd Will Try To Defend Title – Boboye “It’s just matchday one in the league. We still have 37 games to play but it’s a good one for us and I think it will strengthen our confi­dence level. Nobody will tell you he doesn’t want to win. “Just like I told the players, we needed to defend our integrity and they did just that. They were not under pressure and all we needed to do was to go home with a positive result. “There was not much to be said, I told them it could become anybody’s game. All we needed to do was to have a goal ahead of them, once we have a goal, then our confidence level will rise. “I know that the mo­ment we scored that goal, they were desper­ate to equalise, so we were waiting to punish them with a counter. “Our opponents are ‘old dogs’ in the NPFL, so all we needed to do was to put up a good fight to ensure that we get it right.” POLL Remo Stars are atop the league table with eight points from four matches. They are yet to test defeat in the league.
