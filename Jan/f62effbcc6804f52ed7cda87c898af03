We are expanding our school because of the support of our foreign partners. They want us to train young females, especially those at the Internally Displaced Persons (IDP) camps. “We are hoping to train 4,000 Nigerians this year and once we are able to train them, those from the IDP camps will have something to do going forward He said President Muhammadu Buhari had always championed the call to empower Nigerian youths, stressing that this was MOMAS contribution to national development. POLL Balogun said: “We are creating wealth because those trained already are training others and engaging them positively. “We believe that engaging our youths positively will curb restiveness and insecurity in the country. “We don’t just train but we kit them. We also educate them and change their attitude to the job because MOMAS represents good product, good character and good thinking.”
