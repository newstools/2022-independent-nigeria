Newcastle have tabled a £3million loan offer to sign Manchester United star Jesse Lingard. The deal is said to include a survival bonus of a further £4million. Lingard, 29, has long been linked with a move to Newcastle. Throughout the month, the England international has been touted to join the cash-rich, relegation-threatened side and at this late stage – a move is on the cards. Just two starts in 14 games this season has convinced Lingard that he needs to a move – and he is out of contract at the end of the season. That is despite scoring nine goals and creating five more in 16 games at West Ham. Chelsea Have Ousmane Dembele Transfer ‘99%’ Wrapped… Sociedad Knock Back Arsenal’s Deadline Day €70m Bid For… Newcastle have seemingly made a late move to bring him to Tyneside and a deal worth £3million to sign Lingard is on the cards. If Newcastle stay up, they will pay a further £4million to Manchester United for the midfielder. Lingard would be a massive signing for Newcastle. Like Kieran Trippier, Chris Wood, Matt Targett and Dan Burn – he is Premier League proven and in the prime of his career. He boosts the Toon’s chances of survival. Newcastle have a striker in either Wood or Callum Wilson, Allan Saint-Maximin on the left. Lingard on the right would form a fearsome front three and one clearly good enough to fire Eddie Howe’s men to safety. Along with Bruno Guimaraes and the incoming additions of Targett and Burn, Newcastle fans can sit back and revel at the incredible work their new owners have done in the window – even more so, for Lingard.
