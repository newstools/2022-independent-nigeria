BREAKING: Tinubu In Kano On Condolence Visit Tinubu Pays Condolence Visit To Makinde Over  Olubadan, Soun,… “Those saying that are politically ignorant. Tinubu is right to consult with anyone he desires to consult with. Nothing is wrong in him consulting IBB. He is seeking for the highest political office in the land and he can consult anybody he thinks can help him win”. “Contesting for the presidency is not a tea party. Every vote matters in politics and it is a game of numbers.  An aspirant is a blind person. You cannot limit him to whoever he is going to consult with. It is only people who have never consulted election that are talking like that”. “If you are contesting an election, a mechanic is your boss. A market woman is your boss if you are contesting an election. Even students who are like your grandchildren are your boss when you are seeking for votes”. “It is after you have contested and won that you are their boss. Before you get to the position, you have to kneel down for everybody and beg them to support”.
