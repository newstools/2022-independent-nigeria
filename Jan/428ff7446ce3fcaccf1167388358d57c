The father of five-year-old Kano school girl, Hanifa Abubakar who was kidnapped and later gruesomely murdered by a teacher from her school has spoken out on the incident. The father who wept uncontrollably said: “I am really in sorrow for what has happened. I can only thank God. This can happen to anyone and it is said that everyone who lives today will die someday, so I leave everything to God, but till I die, I will never forget this. “Those who did this to me have not been fair to me neither have they been fair to the world.“My daughter returned from the Quranic school.
