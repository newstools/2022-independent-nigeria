A fire broke out at a Turkish-owned mosque in the city of Chemnitz in Germany’s Saxony region on Sunday and the police are investigating it as a possible arson, the pro-govt Daily Sabah reported. The fire started on Saturday evening at a time when no one was believed to be present at the Fatih Mosque. According to a statement by Chemnitz’s police department, a bypasser alerted emergency services that there was a fire and investigators found it appeared to have started in a bulky waste container nearby. The fire would spread to a nearby residential building before it was extinguished. Police investigators surveyed the scene on Sunday, looking for evidence to determine whether or not the fire was intentionally set. They will also be looking for any connection to previous fires in the area or whether or not the act had any political motivations behind it.

The Turkish Consul-General Olgun Yücekök has also said that he is in contact with authorities and will be closely following their investigation. The Fatih Mosque is operated by the Turkish-Islamic Union for Religious Affairs (DITIB). The Islamic union, which was set up in 1984 as a branch of Turkey’s Directorate of Religious Affairs (Diyanet), funds around 900 mosques in Germany and boasts a membership of around 800,000. While DİTİB says it is not officially linked to the Turkish state, it has been accused of spying for Turkey on German citizens, resulting in a temporary suspension of federal funding in 2017.
