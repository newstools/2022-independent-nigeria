Leicester manager Brendan Rodgers admits he was “absolutely thrilled” with his side’s 4-1 win against Watford in the FA Cup third round. The Foxes had ten academy products in their squad as former Aston Villa man Marc Albrighton captained the side. The win got their cup defence off to an ideal start, but will put Leicester’s ex-boss, Claudio Ranieri, under more pressure at Watford. ‘Mourinho One Of The Best Managers In The World’ –… Newcastle Suffer Huge Injury Blow With Wilson Out For Eight… “I was absolutely thrilled with the performance – we only had eight senior players fit and they all played, and we had 10 academy products in our squad today,” Rodgers told BBC Sport. “To see them come in and perform against another Premier League club, with that understanding of the game, and what they gave the game, I was absolutely thrilled for them. “You consider Hamza Choudhury was playing at centre-half – what a performance that was from him. I rang him last night to tell him he would have to play there rather in midfield – he just accepted it and played to a really high level. “We all want to dream. We dreamt last year and won the trophy. Today, with so many players out, to produce that performance and scoreline, makes me very proud and we’re in the hat which is the most important thing.” Meanwhile, Newcastle were knocked out of the FA Cup after a shock 1-0 defeat at home to League One Cambridge. POLL He said: “We are desperately disappointed. We really prepared well for this game and we played a very strong team. “But ultimately we found a goalkeeper in superb form and a team that defended for their lives and we couldn’t break them down. “I don’t think there was anything wrong with our attitude we just couldn’t deliver the quality to score. The players are very disappointed. They know the importance of the FA Cup and they wanted to win. When we did get it right the goalkeeper was in outstanding form and I have to credit Cambridge and their manager.”
