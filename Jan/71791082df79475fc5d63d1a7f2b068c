AWKA – The Anambra State Association of Town Unions (ASATU) says it projects as well as anticipates a fruitful and prosperous new year for Anambra residents as another calendar year begins. ASATU says in spite of the challenges of the just concluded year, the Anambra state remained strong, more formidable and entering the new year with more prospects for development especially with the coming of a new state government later in the year headed by Professor Charles Chukwuma Soludo. National President of ASATU, Chief Titus Nnabuike Akpudo, in his new year message to the people and government of Anambra state, hailed the giant strides of the Willie Obiano administration; commending him for the legacy projects he bequeathed to Ndi-Anambra.

He said irrespective of the noticeable monumental legacy projects of the incumbent state government, more developmental programmes were required to take the state to the next level, adding that much is expected from the incoming governor. He, however, maintained that ASATU will continue to play its integral role in facilitating and spearheading community development programmes in conjunction with the government in power to ensure that Anambra people felt the impact of good governance especially those at the grassroots.
