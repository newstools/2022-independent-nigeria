ABUJA  – President Muhammadu Bu­hari, in a well-crafted message to Nigerians obviously to wrap up the year 2021, promised that he would intentionally leverage on the platforms provided by Information Communication Technology (ICT) to create more jobs for the teeming pop­ulation in 2022. The message personally penned down by the President also reeled out areas which the administration believes it has impacted the lives of Nigeri­ans. From the anti-graft policy of the government to fiscal prudence to battle against in­security as well as managing the Covid-19 pandemic, Buhari scored his administration high. Insecurity: Path To Nationhood Unpredictable, Says Buhari In New… ASATU Projects Prosperous New Year For Ndi-Anambra “We remain grateful to the Almighty God for yet anoth­er Year attained as a country, united by a common destiny and resolute in our determi­nation to overcome the several challenges along the path to build the great and prosperous nation of our dream. “I salute the courage and resilience of all Nigerians, which was evident in 2021 as this nation, like other countries of the world, faced significant challenges that occurred as a consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic and the efforts to re­store the global economy and social order. “The persistent insecurity in certain parts of the country may have threatened to unravel the incremental gains achieved in the real sectors of the econo­my and in the administration’s overall objective to position the nation on the irreversible tra­jectory of sustainable growth and progress, but I assure you that we will remain resolute in our commitments and shall continue to press ahead with our programmes and plans. “The path to nationhood is of­ten fraught with unpredictable difficulties and challenges, and most tried and tested nations have often prevailed through dogged determination, resil­ience, concerted commitment to unity, and the conviction that the whole of the nation, stand­ing together against all odds, is by far greater and would ulti­mately be more prosperous and viable than the sum of its distinguishable parts.
