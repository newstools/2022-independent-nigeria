LAGOS – Chairman of the Police Service Com­mission (PSC), Musiliu Smith, on Monday said efforts should be made to encourage upright and responsible citizens to apply for recruitment in the Police Force. He said if the educated and up­right young ones were motivated to join and remain in the police force, the country would be on the way to having the right number of men and women needed for an efficient police force. The PSC Chairman made this call at a one-day sensitization/town hall meeting on “Police Recruitment Exercise’ held at Adeyemi Bero Au­ditorium, Alausa. Ikeja, Lagos State.

We must, therefore, all come together as a community to en­sure that only the best are recruited into the Nigerian Police. “The PSC has adopted an ap­proach to improving Police, Citizens relationships through Community engagement forums such as this one where issues that affect citizens are addressed and endeavor to keep the conversations going. The purpose of providing security and safety is defeated if the police as a security organization is contaminat­ed with persons who are criminally minded owing to the poor calibre of those applying for recruitment. No one knows better the character of its citizens than members of the community; therefore, citizens are encouraged to kindly urge people of good character to join the force.
