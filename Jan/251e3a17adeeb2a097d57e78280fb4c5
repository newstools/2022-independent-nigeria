The bishop also reiterated the need for the ministers to declare God’s forgiveness to penitent sinners and pronounce God’s blessings as well as preside at the administration of the Holy Baptism. He advised them to continue to pray fervently for the direction of the Holy Spirit on a daily basis to enlarge and enlighten them on the understanding of the Holy Scripture. The cleric also pointed at the importance of faithful service, saying that lack of faithfulness always leads to disaster, while citing that the messy state of Nigeria can be attributed to the unfaithfulness of leaders. “Do not allow things to push you away from faithfulness. Do not run your race from another lane. Faithfulness rewards loyalty, hard work, integrity, and humility. Be a man of faith, courage, and shun fear. Faithful servants see opportunity in challenges. Be positive-minded,” he said. POLL He, however, said there was hope if Nigerians were willing to depart from evil so that God can answer the prayers of the nation.
