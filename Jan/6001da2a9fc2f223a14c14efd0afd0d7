The director-general said that schools that did not comply would be no­tified, and their adminis­trators would face disci­plinary actions. She asked school own­ers to communicate ef­fectively with parents to prepare their wards early for resumption. “Last term, it was ob­served that despite exten­sive sensitisation on the importance of having a synchronised school cal­endar, many schools re­fused to comply with the mid-term break as man­dated in accordance with the academic calendar,” she said. “During our re­c e n t exercise to monitor the level of com­pliance with Tuesday 4th January 2022 resumption date, we observed that the level of compliance was low. “We are going to notify the schools that have not adhered to the academic calendar with ‘Notice of Non-Compliance’ stick­ers and issue letters of invitation to the adminis­trators to visit our office in Alausa where further disciplinary actions will be taken.”
