Occupants of a four-bed­room apartment located off Umono Street, close to Erhimu Secondary School in Abraka, Delta State, have every reason to thank God after they narrowly escaped death during a fire outbreak that destroyed all their property and razed the building. A resident in the area said the cause of the fire that started at midnight was still unknown, but guessed the fire might have come from a resi­dent’s generating set. Details about the inci­dent were still sketchy, but our source said sym­pathisers did everything possible to prevent the fire from spreading to other adjoining build­ings.

Meanwhile, part of Og­be-Ijoh Market was razed by fire Sunday afternoon as goods worth several millions of Naira went down the drain. Although the source of the fire incident was still not known at press time the market is known for yearly fire incidents. However, the Sunday inci­dent was the most serious as most victims were pet­ty traders.
