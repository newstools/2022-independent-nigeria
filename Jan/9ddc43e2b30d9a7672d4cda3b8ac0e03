Earlier before the Fidau prayers by Muslim clerics, Bishop Samuel Olawode of Maranatha Cathedral, in a Christian funeral service, compared the late monarch to King Hezekiah in the Bible and recounted his disposition to religious tolerance. Also in his sermon, Prof Khamil Olosho emphasised the need for righteous living, bearing in mind that death, judgement, reward and after life would be the finality of mankind. According to him, the message was predicated on the fact that “after this life, there will be another life where we will account for our deeds in this world. “Anybody who does goodwill inherits paradise in the hereafter and anyone who does bad will be cast into hell fire. POLL “So, we pray that the Almighty God will protect our baba in a way that he will scale through interrogations on the day of judgement, so that at the end of the day, he will gain paradise.” There were Quaranic recitations coordinated by Islamic clerics as well as Islamic prayers coordinated by the Chief Imam of Ibadanland, Abdulganeey Agbotomokekere, for the late monarch.
