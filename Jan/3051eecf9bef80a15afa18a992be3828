Fiorentina are reportedly negotiating with Aleksandr Kokorin to terminate the contract by mutual consent after a disastrous year at the Stadio Franchi. The veteran striker cost €4.5m to sign from Spartak Moscow in January 2021 and had high hopes of relaunching his career in Serie A with the first experience outside of Russia. However, Kokorin’s performances became a running joke for Fiorentina fans, as when he did manage to get onto the pitch, he was sluggish, disinterested and capable of some spectacular misses from close range when the assist was literally placed on his feet in the six-yard box.

Considering he earns €1.7m net per season with a contract until June 2024, that is a huge drain on resources. According to Radio Bruno, Fiorentina have given up on getting anything out of the 30-year-old and are in negotiations to terminate the contract by mutual consent. Kokorin still wants an extra payment to accept his exit from the Stadio Franchi.
