Newcastle United have suffered a huge injury blow, with head coach Eddie Howe confirming that striker Callum Wilson will miss eight weeks with a calf injury suffered in the 1-1 draw against Manchester United. The news comes after an embarrassing 1-0 FA Cup defeat to League One Cambridge United, following which Newcastle’s ownership entered the changing room to speak to the players. Executive vice-chairman Yasir Al-Rumayyan, Amanda Staveley, and Mehrdad Ghodoussi are understood to have expressed their support to the squad. ‘Mourinho One Of The Best Managers In The World’ –… Rodgers ‘Absolutely Thrilled’ With Patched-Up Leicester The Cambridge result was a shock after Newcastle produced one of their best performances of the season to draw with United. Wilson limped off in the second half of that fixture, an injury immediately deemed serious by Howe. The head coach said on Saturday: “(Wilson) had a scan yesterday because there was a slight doubt over his initial scan and so we needed to let it heal a little bit first. “We think he’s going to be out for around eight weeks.” He also revealed the ownership’s intervention, saying: “Yeah, they did pop in to see the players. I personally wasn’t in there for that, then they saw me with my coaching team after. “I believe they were very supportive to the players, highlighting the fact we’re very much in this fight to stay in the league together, and they’re very much behind everybody. I can’t thank them enough for that support. POLL “I think it was really beneficial for the players to be able to see that and hear that because this journey we’re going on currently and this fight we’re in to stay in this division is a united effort from everybody at the club. “The supporters are playing their part, no doubt, they’ve been magnificent, and the owners wanted to show their support for the players, which is really welcome for me.” Newcastle are currently 19th in the Premier League, two points off safety.
