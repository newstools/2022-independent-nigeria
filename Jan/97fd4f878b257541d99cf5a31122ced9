WARRI  – Dr Michael Tidi, Chairman of War­ri South Local Government Area of Delta State, has said that a committee would be set by the council to inves­tigate the immediate cause of the fire incident that destroyed property worth millions naira at the Ogbe-Ijoh market on Sunday. Tidi, who visited the market to ascertain the level of destruction caused by the fire in the market, said the council would liaise with the Min­istry of Commerce and Industry to see how it could assist those who have lost their property. “Council will set up a committee to investigate the immediate cause of the fire. If there were technical or man-made issues, we will find out and look at how the market can be resus­citated to benefit Warri South people.

On face value, mil­lions of naira has been lost and trad­ers have been reduced to zero level. It is very painful,’ Tidi said. He said his visit to the market “was to help the affected traders re­start something,” adding that, “the magnitude of damage caused by the inferno is huge and I sympathise with the traders over these losses.” Tidi immediately ordered Mr Jo­seph Oribioye, Secretary to the War­ri South Local Government, to liaise with the Ogbe-Ijoh market master and take statistics of the shops that were burnt and their owners and the goods they were trading in, adding that “We know that they have to pay their chil­dren’s school fees.”
