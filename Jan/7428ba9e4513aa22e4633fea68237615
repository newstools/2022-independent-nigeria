Pastor Biodun Fatoyinbo recently gave his barber a car to celebrate the New Year. The man of God took to his Instagram page to celebrate his barber. Read what he wrote below, “It’s a New Year and I thought to put a smile on Yusuf, my Barber’s face. Thank you Yusuf, for being faithful these few years. I know sometimes you have to make sacrifices to cut my hair even as late as 1am because of my schedule, for which I am grateful. I hope this makes you smile and lets you know that God loves you and He rewards faithfulness. Enjoy the rest of your year, Yusuf!”
