The factional chairman of All progressives Congress (APC) in Osun State, Alhaji Rasaq Salinsile, has challenged Governor Adegboyega Oyetola-led administration to substantiate its allegation of a smear campaign against it. In a press statement issued and signed its Publicity Secretary, Comrade Biodun Agboola, a copy of which was made available to newsmen said such allegation was unfounded and that the Oyetola’s administration should be the one to be reminded of many campaigns of calumny it has waged against his predecessor, Ogbeni Rauf Aregbesola since 2018. The statement said Oyetola’s administration should rather check itself properly, saying it is being chased by its own shadow, noting that karma of what he did to his predecessor must be fast catching up with them.

According to the statement, the Governor is crying wolf where there is none in his allegation that a smear campaign was being plotted against him and his government. It said it is amazing that a Governor who has spent the last three years maligning and setting up groups to blackmail his predecessor has raised alarm over the smear campaign. While listing different cases of deliberate falsehood which the Oyetola’s government, for reasons best known to it, had funded and promoted in the last three years, it said: “The case of The Osun Masterminds group is just the latest of such groups, faceless individuals and members of the cabinet that have been assigned to attack and blackmail the former governor, Rauf Aregbesola.”
