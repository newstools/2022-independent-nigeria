LAGOS  – “33” Export Lager, the of­ficial beer for the Super Eagles, has charged the Nigeria national team to complete the good work it has started by ensuring qualification for the Qatar 2022 World Cup. The Super Eagles were on Saturday drawn against the Black Stars of Ghana in the final playoff draw conducted in Douala, Cam­eroon. Among other things, the fixture is bound to rekin­dle the football rivalry that has long existed between the two West African pow­erhouses for more than 50 years. AFCON: X-Raying The Task Against Tunisia Super Eagles To Battle Black Stars For Qatar 2022 Ticket While many rightly ad­mit that the Black Stars remain one of the best on the continent despite their recent dip in form, the na­tional team’s official beer has charged the Super Ea­gles to go all out to ensure they secure what would be their seventh ticket to the Mundial. Senior Brand Manager Aisha Anaekwe while re­acting to the playoff de­scribed it as a tricky one but maintained that with the guaranteed solid back­ing from the “33” Export Lager, the Eagles will defi­nitely soar to Qatar. She reckoned “33” Ex­port’s Lets Go Naija slogan helped the Eagles a great deal while navigating their way in the group stage and believes it would see them through in this final hur­dle. “Playing against our eternal rival, Ghana will bring out the fond mem­ories of the previous encounters between the two teams but the next encounter in March to us is the most important one and we charge the team not to relent in their effort to reach the finals of the World Cup for the seventh time,” she remarked. Since making a debut appearance at the USA 1994 World Cup, the Super Eagles have qualified for all but one of the subse­quent editions of the Mun­dial and they are keen to make it to Qatar to better their best record which re­mains just making it to the second round.
