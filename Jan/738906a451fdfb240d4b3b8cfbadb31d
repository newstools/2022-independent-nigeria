Lucas Digne has said he did not expect his time at Everton “to end this way” as he waits to be announced as an Aston Villa player after falling out of favour with Rafael Benítez. Digne joined Everton from Barcelona in 2018 but has not played since 1 December. The left-back has signed his Villa contract and completed a medical and his move for about £23m is poised to be confirmed. Going in the opposite direction will be Anwar El Ghazi, whose loan to Everton is also due to be sealed on Thursday. There is a buy option in the deal for the 26-year-old.

Wearing the captain’s armband in some matches always made me proud. Everything must come to an end. I just didn’t expect it to end this way.” Benítez said last week that the 28-year-old had asked to leave and accused Digne of prioritising his own interests above those of the Everton team. “What has happened and some things that was said about me in the last month has made me very sad,” Digne continued. “But I’ll not enter a war of words with anyone. The club don’t deserve that, the fans don’t deserve that and to be honest, I don’t feel I deserve that … Sometimes it only takes one person from outside to destroy a beautiful love affair.”
