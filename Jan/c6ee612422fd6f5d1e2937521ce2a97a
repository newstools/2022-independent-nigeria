LAGOS – The Tax Justice Network has condemned the invasion of the offices of the Civil Society Legislative Advocacy Centre (CISLAC) in Abuja, describing it as a violation of the right to freely assemble as enshrined in the Nigerian constitution. The network said the invasion is a new way of intimidation to a network that is working with the government to improve revenue collection that will cover the budget deficit, including possible payment of the salaries of the officers in question.

It works through research and dialogue to create a tax system that generates sufficient public revenue while ensuring equitable redistribution by rebalancing economic, gender and social inequalities.

According to the network, “For the network to work effectively, it requires a free and open civic space devoid of intimidation to engage with government, citizens and professionals for effective result. Hence you will understand our surprise when we learned that the secretariat of the network in Nigeria, Civil Society Legislative Advocacy Centre (CISLAC), was raided by some unidentified person claiming to be from the Department of Security Service.” POLL The group argued that it believed that the officers, who raided the secretariat did not understand the importance of their work and demanded that the officers who raided CISLAC be identified to explain their motive of visiting the office, and why did they adopt an intimidation approach.
