The House of Representatives will tomorrow amend the Electoral Act Bill in line with the Senate’s amendment of Direct, Indirect and Consensus options for the selection of candidates. There has been a disparity between the two chambers on the amendment after the earlier version which only allowed for direct primary was rejected by President Muhammadu Buhari for assent. While the Senate amended the controversial clause 84 to now allow for direct, indirect and consensus, the House of Representatives adopted the direct and indirect options but expunged the consensus.
