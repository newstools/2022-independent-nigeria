Judgement turned awry for a boxing referee who received the hardest punch of his life from a Ukrainian heavyweight boxer, Lago Kiladze, immediately after the referee, Samuel Burgos, stopped Kiladze’s encounter with Viktor Faust. Kiladze contested Faust on the undercard of the Luis Ortiz vs Charles Martin main event on New Year’s Day in Florida. His fight against Faust was intense right from the first bell, with both boxers going hell for leather for the win.

Meanwhile, Faust, who had never been dropped previous to this fight, then got a taste of his own medicine and fell to the canvas after a sharp counter right from Kiladze not long after he had recovered from the mat. Both boxers shared five knockdowns between them, which certainly is not a regular occurrence, particularly so early on in a fight. Kiladze scored the fourth of the aforementioned five knockdowns when Faust, 29, was knocked down for just the second time ever, but it was not until an overhand right dropped Kiladze that the referee stepped in. The official Burgos asked Kiladze to walk towards him but when the Ukrainian stumbled, the fight was waved off. POLL This was met by immense disappointment from the fans, and even Faust, who was awarded the victory. He could not hide his confusion at the decision. However, Kiladze, 35, seemed to take the frustrations out with a quick jab at Burgos as the official called off the fight. The act was obviously baffling for viewers around the world but Burgos was luckily able to see the funny side and laugh off such a bizarre incident.
