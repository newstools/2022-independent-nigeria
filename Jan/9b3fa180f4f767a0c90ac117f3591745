YENAGOA  – Governor of Bayelsa State, Douye Diri, has declared that the removal of the paramount ruler of Otu­okpoti community in the Ogbia Local Government Area, Cousin Wongo, is ir­revocable despite protest from some quarters. He spoke during a recep­tion at Otuokpoti shortly after commissioning a Divisional Police Station constructed by the Ogbia council chairman, Ebiyon Turner, on Thursday. Diri had on Monday an­nounced the community chief’s deposition and the sacking of the Communi­ty Development Committee chairman and the youth president following their alleged complicity in the kidnap of the Commis­sioner for Industry, Trade and Investment, Federal Otokito, from his residence in the community on Jan­uary 20. 100 Shops Built On DSC Land Brought Down In Udu Alao-Akala To Be Buried On February 18 Otokito, however, re­gained his freedom five days after on Monday with severe injuries and plasters at his back and right arm, inflicted on him by his ab­ductors. The governor said his action was in accordance with the Nigerian Constitu­tion and the laws of Bayel­sa State and that no amount of protest can make him change his mind. He said, “I did not depose your paramount ruler be­cause I hated him. The cir­cumstances that led to his dethronement are known to me and the commission­er of police. And that depo­sition stands. Anybody that is protesting, I am very sorry. “As governor, once I make a pronouncement that is it. Nobody can do anything about it. In the Constitution and the laws of Bayelsa on chieftaincy and traditional rulers, the final authority lies with the governor.” According to him, the Commissioner of Police had earlier hinted that the state command had its searchlight on the commu­nity before the kidnap of his cabinet member.
