A police department in Turkey’s central Eskişehir province has issued a fine against members of left-wing activist groups, after they hung a banner in protest of the country’s ailing economy and soaring inflation. Members of the Eskişehir Halkevleri were issued a fine of 18,000 liras ($1,330) after they unfurled a banner from their headquarters reading, “Geçinemiyoruz – Zamlar geri alınsın ’’ (We cannot get by – price hikes should be reversed), Diken news site said. Turkish citizens are struggling to make ends meet as the country’s inflation registered at 36 percent in December, an all-time high in almost two decades. Meanwhile, Turkey’s lira lost 44 percent of its value in 2021, dipping to the historic lows against the dollar and euro, prompting to government to unveil an emergency plan to protect people with lira deposits against wild swings in the currency’s value.
