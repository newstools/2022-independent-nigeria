The People Democratic Party in Bauchi State has disassociated itself and Governor Bala Abdulkadir Mohammed from anything connected to the violence that emaniated from the 21st memorial anniversary of late Baba Peter Gonto in Bauchi last Saturday at Bogoro local government in Bauchi State. This was contained in a press statement signed by the PDP Legal Adviser, Barrister Ship Rabo and made available to newsmen in the state. According to the release, following the statement dated on the 30th December 2021, issued by the All Progressives Congress APC Bauchi State Chapter on the issues relating to the memorial events being organized at Mwari, Bogoro L.G.A of Bauchi State in honour of the patriarch and hero of the Zaar nation, Late Baba Peter Gwonto, the PDP as the governing party in the state present its position on the erroneous and biased stance of the defeated APC in the state, so that members of the public and discerning minds within and outside the state will be guided unto the path of the truth. Ekiti 2022: Fayemi Urges Politicians To Shun Violence,… Oyo Partners NGO’, Sensitises Judical Officers On… The statement said that it is the belief of the PDP, that knowing what the late Baba Peter Gonto represents, the catalogue of events in his honour by his people is simply a tribal and community affair put together by proud, responsible and concerned sons and daughters of the land. “Discerning observers can appreciate the point that it is sheer mischief for the wobbling APC to read politics especially one that pertains to political parties into the event. For this reason alone, security agencies will do well to task those behind the politicization theory of the proofs for their position as failing will encourage people to always take pleasure of introducing politics into everything and thereby overheating the polity as well as threatening public peace and security in the state as it is presently the case because of this matter” “Now that the fact has emerged that the repeated reference to the Governor in the APC’s Press Statement regarding this issue, is done solely for mischief purposes.We categorically make the point that Zaar nation is too enlightened to reduce a serinus matter like the said memorial events to a party affair. ” In other words, APC’s position that it’s members should stay away from the event is laughable because, among others, it suggest that all loyal Za’ar sons and daughters who have been gracing the event are members of the PDP. Members who are right there at Mwari have chosen not to allow a wool to be drawn over their eyes. This is because they know the whole thing is about their tribe, community and its future and nothing else” “With regards to the allegations of threat to security of the area because of the event and the performance of His Excellency’s led government including matters such as the payment of salary, it is our position that civil servants are faring better now compared to APC’s forgotten reign of 2015-2019 as well as other areas of governance .This is a testimony that Bauchi State is making progress under party for which obviously, the opposition are losing sleep ,hence their clutching all every straw to join issues with us. POLL “The PDP uses this medium to call on security agencies across the state to step up efforts towards fishing out and prosecuting the bad elements who are hiding under the guise of a purely socio-cultural event of the Zaur people, to cause trouble. We equally stand tall and on the same page with the Governor in taking exception to attempts froms some quarters to pia wetee in the smooth relationship between the state government and the President Muhammadu Buhuri-led federal government” “We therefore call on the APC to brace up for a modern, legal and acceptable way of politicking in terms of contest of ideas, positive values, demontrastrable leadership skills and sustained socio-economic development of the people. Evidently, Governor Bala Mohammed led administration in Bauchi State is remarkably leading the way in this context and as a party that is on rescue mission nationally, PDP stand in solidarity with the people in pursuit of worthy endeavors at all times” The statement read
