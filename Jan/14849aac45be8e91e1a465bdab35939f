Aston Villa are refusing to give up in their chase of Rodrigo Bentancur and they’re ready to make a higher offer to Juventus. The Premier League side previously offered €22m in total for the 24-year-old Uruguayan midfielder, which failed to convince the Bianconeri, who value the player at around €30m. The Turin side are aware that they need to pay Boca Juniors around 35-37% of cash generated from Bentancur’s sale, and so they won’t let him leave for a low price. As reported by Calciomercato.com, Aston Villa are serious about signing Bentancur and they’re preparing to submit a new offer for the player, which is set to sit around €25m including add-ons.

He’d like to finish the season in Turin, but also appreciates the English club’s interest and their willingness to raise his salary from €2.5m net per season to €4.5m per season. Antonio Conte’s Tottenham are also interested in the Uruguayan midfielder and they’ve asked for him on a loan deal with a buy option attached, something that didn’t convince the Bianconeri. Lyon are also interested in the player and they’ve requested information, but haven’t made an offer yet.
