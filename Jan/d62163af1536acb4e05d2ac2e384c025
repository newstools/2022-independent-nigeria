…..Hopeful Abia High Court Will Uphold The Law The Coalition of United Political Parties (CUPP) has called on the Abia High Court, particularly the Judge handling the Nnamdi Kalu case, to be courageous and resist any external pressures or interference. Expressing hope that Abia High Court will uphold the law on the case of Kalu, the CUPP, in a statement by its spokesman, Ikenga Imo Ugochinyere, noted that the fundamental rights case filed by the leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra, Mazi Kanu has been fixed for judgment on the 19th January 2022 by the High Court of Abia State, Umuahia. “Given the overriding importance of this case, CUPP hereby calls on Abia High Court, particularly the Judge handling the case, to be courageous and resist any external pressures or interference. The Judge must be firm and do justice while declaring the law as it is. That is the minimum the Judge owes to the society,” the opposition said. The CUPP also condemned all illegal actions against Nigerian citizens many of whom are in illegal detention and called on the relevant agencies of the state to take necessary and urgent actions to reverse the trend.

This government has clearly restricted the space for Nigerians to exercise their freedom of speech. “We are however hopeful that the judiciary will however stand up in these times and be counted. We ask for no favors, we only demand that the law be declared as it is without bowing to any external influences,” CUPP said.
