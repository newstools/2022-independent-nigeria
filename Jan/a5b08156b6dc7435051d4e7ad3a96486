Miyetti Allah Cattle Breeders Association of Nigeria (MACBAN) has refuted reports that it endorsed ex-Lagos State Governor, Bola Tinubu for President. The body said the position of individuals on who succeeds President Muhammadu Buhari in 2023 should not be regarded as a general one.

Ahmed Tinubu. “We want to make it clear that the association has not endorsed any candidate. Those who endorsed Tinubu are doing so as individuals. “MACBAN should not in any way be dragged into the politics of endorsement at this stage,” Ngelzarma said. On January 10, Tinubu formally informed Buhari of his desire to become the All Progressives Congress (APC) flagbearer.
