The Rt. Rev. Olusola Odedeji, Bishop of Diocese of Lagos West of the Church of Nigeria (Anglican Communion), has advised Christians to pay attention to the study of the Bible, sermons, Christian movies and books, as means of divine guidance for victorious living. Odedeji said it was necessary Christians sought God’s guidance in every step of their lives, even as another year had begun. “Divine guidance is all about God leading, being the only one that can lead successfully,” he reportedly stated in his homily delivered at the New Year thanksgiving service held at the Archbishop Vining Memorial Church Cathedral, Lagos.
