Chukwunonso Daniel Ogbe is the Chairman of African People’s Alliance (APA) in Enugu State. In this interview with PATIENCE OGBODO-IWUAGWU, he speaks on Igbo presidency, insecurity situation in Nigeria among others. Excerpts The South Easterners are agitating for Presidency in 2023, how optimistic are you that an Igbo man will become President in 2023? From the handwriting on the wall, it’s likely that an Igbo man will become the President of this country in 2023 especially with the recent development in the Peoples Democratic Party, (PDP). Because from the information made available so far in the public domain, the party has decided to zone the Presidency seat to the Southern part of the country and putting into consideration that former President Goodluck Jonathan is from the South South Political zone, and the South West Political zone has also produced Chief Olusegun Obasanjo between 1999 to 2007. So, to great extent, I believe that the ruling party may zone the presidential ticket to south East political zone, if not on the face of it, it may not feel visible in the fact that APC as a political party seems not to be well grounded as a party in South East zone but for the purpose of having social cohesion in the country, may be the APC may want to put political point by also zoning it to the south East and if that will happen, there might be a political confusion in the sense that some persons who are not comfortable with APC may be force to embrace a situation whereby they may be compelled to vote an Igbo man who may become APC Presidential candidate for the purpose of actualising the dream of having President of South East political zone. Why APC Will Field A Muslim-Muslim Ticket In 2023 – Okunola AFCON: Buhari Urges Super Eagles To Maintain Their Terrific Form In my own point of view, one of the major reasons why I’m lending support to the agitation for President of South East extraction is just for us to have that sense of belonging as a people so that it will not be as if we are visitors in Nigeria. But far from that it may not actually go a long way in solving the entrenched injustice in the South East, just in America for instance, prior to the emergence of former President Barak Obama as the President of the United states, blacks have being facing racial prejudice in the United State and Indiscrimination and the emergence of Barak Obama never solve that particular problem till date as the issue of racism still persist in the environment of America, in as much as America on his own has tried to address the issue of race prejudice against black so the point I’m trying to make is that the emergence of an Igbo man as the President of Nigeria will not automatically do away with some perceived injustice against the people of South East Political zone, but it may be a take up point in addressing the injustice in south East so it will be a welcome development. As We have only two major political parties and in as much as I will want to accord any superior status to this two political parties, that’s the convention on the ground and secondly anytime the PDP as a political party zone it’s chairmanship position to any particulate part of the country, let’s say to the South, to a great extent, there is this believe that the presidential candidate will emerge from the North and verse verse. Now as the current Chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party is from Northern part of the country to some great extent there is a chance that PDP will also zone presidential ticket to southern part of the country so I may see these two political parties fielding candidates from South East in which Nigerians will now be faced with the situation we witnessed in 1999 where PDP and AD had two Presidential candidates from the same zone so such scenario may also play out again in which Nigerians may be forced to choose from the two major candidates What is the solution to the agitation of injustice in the South East as you stated earlier that Igbo presidency might not solve the problem ? The solution is addressing the injustice in the land and when I talked about the South East, I wouldn’t want to sound selfish. If we are talking about injustice in the south East, we will also take a look at other part of Nigeria and you will find out that other Nigerians also suffer injustice occasioned by bad governance and army of visionless leaders. To address the agitation coming also from other part of this country, there are certain things that we need to put in place not really because I’m a south Easterner, if you are talking about basic infrastructures, basic amenities, Igbo’s are meant to be business men, traders so it will not be a bad idea to have a seaport in Onitsha because if we do that the issue of population explosion we are witnessing in Abuja and Lagos will be addressed to some great extent . If we are talking about International airport, we have only one in Enugu and the one we have in Enugu, we know the situation surrounding the airport so if we can have basic infrastructures and amenities like functional seaport, functional airport as well as having good federal roads so when these issues are being taken care of, we can then proudly say that what’s sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander but if we have an Igbo President and we don’t have any sea port in the south East even when majority of the people are traders that travels to different part of the country and the world, then the basic challenges of the people are yet to be addressed, if you look at the federal roads in this zone, they are in a shambles and in very bad state, Some of the south East leaders should also be blamed for this because if you are taking about marginalization, you should also talk about internal and external marginalization because most south East leaders also marginalized the south East people but this is also peculiar to other geo-political zones, in the sense that some of our leaders have failed to live up to their expectations as they don’t make good use of the federal allocation for the development of the their zones and that’s why when we talk about restructuring, we ask ourselves what have they being able to do with the power they enjoy at the moment so we are suffering marginalization on a larger note so what should be done is for our leaders to do the needful and live up to expectation. As we are talking about having seaport in Onitsha, leaders should also consider restoring the groundnut pyramid in Kano because we are taking about economic diversification , Nigeria is thriving on a mono economy and that’s why we are having problem as the oil market does not longer favour us so our leaders should revive our economy so that Nigeria can make progress. Most of the fear people nurture about Biafra agitation, this fear to some great extent will be addressed once the issue of injustice is address because if you address the issue of injustice, anybody talking about Biafra will not be taken serious but when the ground for agitation is fertile, when their is obvious injustice the agitation will keep thriving. POLL There is a report of an alleged plot of former President Goodluck Jonathan to contest for election in 2023, which some Igbo leaders have described the move as a betrayal to the people of South East, what’s your take on this? Constitutionally, President Jonathan is qualified to contest for the President of Nigeria again, he has the legal right to aspire for the office but most of us the Igbos are too emotional and because of our emotional nature most of us sacrifice in protecting Goodluck Jonathan when he was in power as President of this country and he even went as far as embracing an Igbo name Azikiwe, and apart from that, many Igbos harbored many political setbacks in projecting Goodluck Presidency and before the emergence of President Jonathan, there has been some level of mistrust between the people of south East and south south and that was an opportunity to unify the people of this two political zone and going by this believe that an Igbo man should be allowed to become the President of the country, I think in the spirit of equity and fairness and especially for those who sacrificed for President Goodluck Jonathan, if I’m in the position, I will advise him to jettison that ambition, I believe that whoever may be persuading him to run for the President might have done that based on the political calculation that constitutionally if he should become a President after the period of 4 years, he cannot occupy the office again in which power might go back to the Northern part of the country but life is all about compromise but I think he should shelve that ambition going by the sacrifices the people of this political zone made for the purpose of protecting and projecting his political interest. If he decided to run for the Presidency that will be the highest political betrayal on the South East.
