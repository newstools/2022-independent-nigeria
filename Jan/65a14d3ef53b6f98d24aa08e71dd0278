The Senior Special Assistant to the President on Media and Publicity, Garba Shehu, on Friday stated that Nigerians pressured and persuaded President Muhammadu Buhari to run for the presidency after he had served as governor, minister, and military Head of State. He disclosed this while speaking on Channels Television’s Sunrise Daily programme, expressing that the President has given his best to serve the citizens and country. Shehu said, “The president can be very casual sometimes in speaking and jovial and jocularly; I think this is what people fail to understand of him.
