President General Elect of Egini Community in Udu Local Government Area of Delta State, Mr. Paul Bukata, has called on the elders and leaders of the community to facilitate his swearing-in as the duly elected president-general of the community. Bukata in a press statement on Sunday called on the public to disregard the purported swearing-in of one Mr. Midwest Wetah in the private residence of a former Delta State House of Assembly member, instead of the community town hall as the president general. He described the swearing-in of Mr. Wetah as illegal, shameful and awkward, capable of truncating the existing peace in the community. He faulted the purported swearing-in of Mr. Wetah in a private resident because he, Wetah, lost election at the family (Ataifo) and the quarter levels. He noted that Egini community conference usually hold every two years in the town hall, adding that and it was during the conference that a new president general and other executives were usually sworn in but the case of Mr. Wetah was different because it was done in a private resident and in the night. In the statement, Bukata said “I, Mr. Paul Bukata, is the President General Elect. I won at the family and quarter levels. I was duly nominated by our quarter (Aghore) and a written document bearing my name and signed by the quarter Chairman, Secretary and oldest man.” “The said document was sent to the screening committee as required by the Egini Community Constitution. I was screened by the screening committee and scored the highest marks of 80 percent,” he added. “I was surprised to hear that the person who was not nominated by the quarter was sworn in in a private house. I have sued them in a court of Law and I believe I will be sworn in as the President General soon,” he said.
