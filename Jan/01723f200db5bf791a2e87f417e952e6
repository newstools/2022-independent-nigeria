President-General of pan-Igbo socio-cultural group, Ohanaeze Ndigbo Worldwide, Professor George Obiozor, has insisted that the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), does not speak for the entire people of the South-East. Obiozor, who disclosed this on Friday while featuring on Arise TV, said, “Take it from me and it is the right statement: IPOB doesn’t speak for Igbo and that is the truth. “To be very candid with you, the IPOB anger is an accumulated anger based on perceived or real injustice against Ndigbo for so long.
