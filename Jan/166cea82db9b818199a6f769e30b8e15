He refuted the outrageous figures of those killed by bandits, which are being published in the social and conventional media, and accused profiteers of the crime for the exaggeration. The governor, who noted that the initial peace agreement he signed with the bandits worked for nine months, said the agreement got grounded by some people, who instigated the bandits to renege on their commitments of the agreement to gain cheap political clout. He, however, said the new strategy to be adopted, which he has informed President Buhari about, would soon usher in peace and stability in the region. Governor Matawalle thanked the Republic of Niger for assisting Nigeria in her fight against terrorism and banditry.
