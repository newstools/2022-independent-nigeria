YENAGOA – Mr. Daniel Iworiso-Markson, a former Bayelsa State Commissioner for Information and Orientation, has described the late Professor Lawrence Ekpebu, who died on January 2, 2022, as a successful scholar and respected diplomat. He said that aside from his star feat of being the first African graduate of the prestigious Harvard University in the United States, Ekpebu achieved a lot in his lifetime. Iworiso-Markson, who spoke in Yenagoa when he visited the widow of the late Ekpebu on Friday, said though he died at a ripe age of 90, his passing was shocking, painful and sad.

Iworiso-Markson recalled that in 2018 while still serving as Commissioner for Information and Orientation, he invited the late Ekpebu to chair one of the days of the week-long inter-ministerial briefing to commemorate the sixth anniversary of former Governor, Seriake Dickson, now a Senator. “He shared his experience with us then and it was so much of a motivation for me personally and since then we became very close until he passed on”, he said. The former commissioner said he was always in touch with late Ekpebu and had hinted last year of his plans to put together a rich literature of all his achievements before his unfortunate demise. He urged the bereaved family to be comforted by the admirable legacies and footprints he left behind. POLL Iworiso-Markson also thanked the Bayelsa State government for indicating its intention to give the illustrious Bayelsan a befitting state burial.
