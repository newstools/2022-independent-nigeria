LAGOS – Former presidential aide, Reno Omokri has advised Nigerians to quit spending their hard earned income on designer clothing, rather, invest in their future because the owners of the said designer clothing are already billionaires. In his opinion, the owners of these designer outfits don’t need the hard earned income of Nigerians because they are already wealthy. He wrote on his official twitter handle, @renoomokri, “The owners of Gucci, Armani and Louis Vuitton are already billionaires. You are not a billionaire. You are not a millionaire. You are not even worth $100,000. They don’t need your money. You need your money more than them. Invest in your future, not their future!”.
