Pastor Oladapo Moses, Presiding Officer of The Early Church, Oke Owa, Ijebu Ode, Ogun State, has said immodest dressing, especially in the church, is evil and should be fought against. He called on individuals to desist from it and asked churches to stop promoting it. “Talking generally, it (immodest dressing) is very bad and not Christ-like. All those doing this should stop because it is a great sin. In my own church I don’t allow that.

Everything is stated in that chapter; we should all start a life of preparation for the second coming of Jesus Christ because He will soon come,” Moses stated in an interview. In a country not enjoying peace, he called for continuous prayers. “Our security challenges could be overcome. We only need to continue to pray for our leaders to enable them to do the right things and have the will to do the right things. Anything going on well needs prayers to support it. The reverse case also needs prayers,” he stated.
