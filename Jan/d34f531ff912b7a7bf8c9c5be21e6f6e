The nation’s GDP had recorded a sustained rebound in the first three quarters of year to close at 4.03 per cent growth Year-on-Year (YoY) in real terms at the end of third quarter 2021, largely due to base effect of the 2020 COVID-19 subdued GDP figures.

Analysis of the market showed that the Return-on-Investment (RoI) in 2020 was higher when compared to the year 2021. Specifically, the ASI had gained 50.03 per cent in 2020. The stock market continued its active momentum in January 2021 with the ASI appreciating by 5.32 percent. Thereafter, equities started to decelerate due to the rising yield on fixed income securities. At the end of first half 2021, H1 2021, ASI had declined to 37,907.28 with YtD return of -5.9 percent while equities market capitalization declined to N19.76 trillion. The ASI ended third quarter 2021, Q3 2021, at -11 percent. Resurgence of equities in the secondary market started early in October 2021 when the ASI became positive on the back of rising crude oil price, improving fundamentals of the economy, high expectations from Q3 2021 results and heavy transactions on FBN Holdings, and Lafarge Africa. POLL After the expansionary monetary policy of H2’20 which drove yield on debt to low single digit, yield started to rise from February 2021, causing financial assets to retreat back to fixed income securities. As at end of Q3’21, yield on the 364 day treasury bill was around 5.34 percent and the 10 year bond hovered around 12.5 percent. Compared to 2020, the primary market was relatively active in 2021. Over N4.6 trillion new issues, mainly debt issues, hit the capital market in H1’21. BUA Cement’s listing of it’s N115 billion bond was one of them. In H2 ‘21, corporate bonds issued by Dangote Cement and MTN among others, hit the capital market. From January to December, public debt inundated the market. FGN Savings Bond was revived while Sukuk hit the market on several occasions. The high point in public issuance was the equities offer for sale of about 575 million ordinary shares to retail investors by MTN Communication Nigeria Plc. That was a giant step in the revival of the equities public offering market which had been dormant since 2008. The year also witnessed a series of market events that shaped market direction. 2021: How BDC Forex Ban, e-Naira Introduction, Shaped Finance… African Expansion Is Part Of Our Corporate Strategic Plan –… These comprised of a series of delistings most popular of which was 11 Plc (former Mobil), and new listings, the MTN offer, corporate actions – (UAC & UPDC) GTCo rebranding, and mergers and acquisition involving Eterna Plc, Honeywell Flour Mill Plc, Union Bank of Nigeria Plc, as well as the NGX demutualization. Investment analysts said the market would record a mixed performance in 2022 being a re-election year. David Adonri, analyst and Executive Vice Chairman, High Cap Securities Limited, while commenting said: “Despite the relatively positive performance of the capital market in 2021, the ratio of equities market capitalization to GDP was around 12.2 per cent, indicating that the capital market is not strongly integrated with the economy.” Continuing, he said: “Full reopening of the borders and economy in 2021, together with increase in activities boosted the country’s macroeconomic conditions. The capital market benefited from them. The market was shaped by rising crude oil price, inflationary pressures, exchange rate disequilibrium, interest rate movement and improved fundamentals of listed companies.” Ambrose Omordion, Chief Research Officer, Investdata Consulting, said: “Nigerian equity market in 2021 recorded a mixed performance and volatile sessions to sustain a positive outing of 2020 though on a low momentum. The trade metrics on volume of transactions so far stood at 79.31 billion shares against 2020 position of 85.30 billion units. “Also treasury bill rate on long tenor declined to five percent and events on individual stocks on merger or acquisitions news impacted positively on stocks and sector performance.” Outlook for 2022 In his comment, Adonri said: “There are worries that the equities market may suffer from the usual penultimate election year syndrome in 2022. Downside factors that may stifle equities include reduction in capital inflow due to rising global inflation and slowdown of China’s economy. “This may also reduce demand for crude oil, causing prices to fall to around $62 per barrel. Volatile oil market can dampen investors’ confidence. Equities may be crowded out in 2022 by the increased resort to debt finance and flee to safety by investors. Covid19 is still a threat that can disrupt activities in 2022”. Omordion of Investdata, said: “Outlook for the economy and stock market in 2022 would remain mixed and dicey being pre-election year with expectations of change in economic policies of the government, especially as the government is going ahead to remove subsidies in the oil sector. This and others will shape the economy and influence the stock market positively or negatively depending on investors’ sentiment and level of liquidity.” Malam Garba Kurfi , the Managing Director, APT Securities and Funds Limited, noted that the market in 2022 might witness listing of food and generating companies which is expected to attract investors into the market. He added that: “I expect building materials to do very well as well as Flour Mill, Oil, financial and Telecommunications companies to sustain the impressive earnings.”
