Twitter said on Sunday that it has permanently suspended the personal account of outspoken Republican congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene for violating the platform’s COVID-19 misinformation policy. The lawmaker from Georgia is a fervent supporter of Donald Trump. Twitter said it was shutting down Greene’s personal account — @mtgreenee — for repeated violations of its COVID-19 misinformation policy. She still has access to her official Twitter handle, which is @RepMTG.

Greene hit back after her suspension, saying in a statement on Telegram that Twitter is “an enemy to America and can’t handle the truth. That’s fine, I’ll show America we don’t need them and it’s time to defeat our enemies. “ Twitter had sanctioned Greene before the permanent suspension. Her account was suspended for one week in August after she tweeted that the Food and Drug Administration should not approve COVID-19 vaccines because they were “failing” to slow the spread of the virus. A year ago, Twitter banned Donald Trump from the platform after the January 6 riot at the U.S. Capitol by Trump supporters, who were fired up by his claims that he was robbed of victory over Joe Biden.
