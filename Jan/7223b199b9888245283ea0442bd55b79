British car manufacturers had their slowest November in 37 years as the sector struggled to cope with the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on global supply chains, industry data showed, recently. Car production fell by 28.7 per cent compared with November 2021 to 75,756 units, despite a 53 per cent increase in electric vehicle output, the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) said. It was the fifth consecutive month of decline and represented the worst November performance since 1984.

It the first 11 months of 2021, British car production of just under 800,000 units was down by 433,000 compared with 2019, before the pandemic hit. “COVID is impacting supply chains massively, causing global shortages – especially of semiconductors, which are likely to affect the sector throughout next year,” Hawes said. The risks of a new economic slowdown caused by the Omicron variant of the coronavirus and rising inflation represented the toughest business environment in decades, Hawes said. “We have to look to government to provide support measures in the same way it is recognising other COVID-impacted sectors,” he said. POLL Britain announced last week 1 billion pounds of extra support for hospitality and leisure businesses, which have been hit hardest by Omicron.
