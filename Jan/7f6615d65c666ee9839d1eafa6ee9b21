The Anambra State Government has commiserated with the family of late Chief Andrew Ozigbo. Chief Andrew Ozigbo, 93, father of the Peoples Democratic Party governorship candidate Valentine Ozigbo, died on January 2, 2022. A statement by the Commissioner for Information and Public Enlightenment, Mr C-Don Adinuba, said Ozigbo was always conscious of his role and status as a foremost educationist and a devout Christian.

Despite his advancement in age, Ozigbo always encouraged his son to play by the rules, eschewing all forms of violence and bitterness and fraud. “Chief Ozigbo represented the typical Anambra spirit: a strong determination to excel. He was, for instance, an elementary school headmaster, which was a big position in those days, yet he was not satisfied with his status in life. Through determination, further studies and continuous improvement as well as drive, he ended up a secondary school principal. “He inculcated strong values in his family of three girls and four boys, including Valentine Ozigbo, his last child. “It gladdens the heart that he lived up to a ripe age, surviving the calamity of losing his first son, Collin Ozigbo, an engineer with the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation, who died in a plane crash crash in Port Harcourt, Rivers State, in 2006.”
