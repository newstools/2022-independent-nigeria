YENAGOA – Bayelsa State Governor, Douye Diri, has said his administration will leave no stone unturned to ensure the release of his Trade and Investment Commissioner, Federal Otokito, who was kidnapped on Thursday, January 20. Diri called for his immediate and unconditional release by his abductors, stressing that the state’s laws against kidnapping would be followed to the letter against them. Otokito was kidnapped by some gunmen from his residence in Otuokpoti, his hometown, in the Ogbia Local Government Area of the state.

The governor, in a statement on Monday by his Chief Press Secretary, Daniel Alabrah, called on youths to shun kidnapping which, he said, was counter-productive to the state and their wellbeing. He said he had been on top of the incident since it happened last Thursday night, adding that the victim would be freed unhurt. Diri said, “I left Yenagoa for Abuja and within the period, one of my cabinet members was kidnapped. A lot of people expected me to make statements but I am not a man of too many words. “I advise those who settle scores by kidnapping and criminality that there are laws of Bayelsa State against kidnapping. Let me call on those that kidnapped my Commissioner of Trade and Investment to immediately release him without any conditions. POLL “I have been on it from the beginning till now and I will ensure that he is released unhurt. I advise all others involved in that criminal, ungodly and inhumane act to have a change of mind and leave that illegitimate business.” He thanked organisers of the annual KOLGA Thanksgiving Day, particularly the visioner, Apostle David Zilly-Aggrey.
