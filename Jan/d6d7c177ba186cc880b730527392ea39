The president of the Chartered Insurance Institute of Nigeria (CIIN), Sir Muftau Oyegunle has thrown his weight behind the Federal Government’s plan to institutionalise health insurance for elderly above 60 years of age but for him, it is not enough as all Nigerians deserve the social services. Speaking with Daily Independent recently, the CIIN chieftain who doubles as the chairman, Insurance Industry Consultative Council (IICC), noted that the gesture has been long overdue and would want to see all Nigerians being part of the social service as it is obtainable in other civilised climes. “The health insurance is very, very basic. All Nigerians should be covered. I was reading a report that the government is planning health insurance cover for all the elderly, for those of us who are above 60 years of age, fine, but we are years behind.

And as I said, now that we seem to be having the support of the federal government and the National Assembly has promised that the new Insurance Law will come out early next year, we believe that 2022 will be a better year for the industry than 2021.” He said. Recall that the National Insurance Commission (NAICOM) played host to Prof Nasir Sambo, the executive secretary of the National Health Insurance Scheme (NHIS) and his team in his Abuja office. Both parties agreed to work closely on the implementation of professional indemnity insurance and other health related policies for health workers.
