WARRI – For dragging Egini Community to Court and consistently insisting that the community has no say in who become Executive members of the community over the issue of zoning of positions in the constitution, the community, at an enlarged meeting comprising of the elders, men, women and youths have banned the Bukata family from all affairs of the community until the issues are resolved. The decision was taken at the community town hall presided over by Mr Midwest Wetah, President General of Egini Community. The community also ratified the dissolution of the Aghore quarter executive led by Silvanus Ekokotu, barring him from all community affairs as long as the case instituted by Evang Paul Bukata against the community lasted in court because as interpreted by the custom and tradition of the people, ‘he who takes you to court is never your friend and cannot participate in your affairs’ and that anybody who appears to be backing the action of the Bukata family shall face the same sanctions.

According to reports from the meeting, the Bukata family including Evang Paul Bukata, Hon Ovoke Bukata, Matthew Bukata, Meshack Bukata and other members of the Bukata family have been overtly supportive of the move by Evang Paul Bukata to declare himself the winner of the Community presidential election as reported in a national newspaper based on his quarter alleged endorsement for the position of president whereas the community election committee announced Midwest Wetah as the winner and duly elected. Those sanctioned are not to greet anybody in Egini, buy and sell from anybody, associate with any Egini indigene and other related sanctions until the issues are resolved. The elders’ council had maintained that Mr Midwest Wetah was duly and validly elected and inaugurated and that the new administration has been embraced by all and sundry stressing that any objection from the Bukata gate of the Ataifo larger family and a few dissidents in the Aghore quarter cannot overturn the position of the community on the election. The community warned that anybody discovered to be behind the court case into which community money would be channelled should see themselves as the enemy of the community and would be sanctioned accordingly.
