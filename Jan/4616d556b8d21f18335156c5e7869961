The national leader of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), pointed out that the explanation became necessary following insinuations from some quarters that, the money was meant to buy votes, adding that there was no votes buying during the period. “The N140 million was meant for party agents’ fee and not for buying votes as some may insinuate. There was no buying of votes during that time. The money was purely for payment of party agents”, Osoba emphasized. He insisted that he was rigged out of office, but added that he has since put behind him the controversial election, just as he called on journalists to join in the fight against fake news. The former governor also pointed out that many bloggers contributed to the spread of fake news, hence, the need for professionals to rise up to the challenges of addressing the menace before it caused further havoc for the profession.
