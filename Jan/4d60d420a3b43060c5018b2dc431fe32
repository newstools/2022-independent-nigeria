Carlo Ancelotti is one of the most successful coaches in the history of club management and currently in charge of Real Madrid, but UEFA want him to take an exam before he can sit on the bench again. According to the Corriere dello Sport, Ancelotti’s coaching badges expired on December 31, 2021. That means UEFA sent a letter warning the 62-year-old Italian would have to sit an exam and be given the all-clear before his certification is renewed.

That includes three editions of the Champions League, the League titles in Italy, France and England, two Club World Cups and only last month the Spanish Supercup with Real Madrid. The report claims the Spanish Federation have contacted UEFA to politely suggest putting Ancelotti through an examination process after 1,200 games is going to make all involved look rather silly.
