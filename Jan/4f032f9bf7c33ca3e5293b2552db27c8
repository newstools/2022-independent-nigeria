ABUJA  – Salihu Mohd Lukman, Di­rector-General of the Pro­gressive Governors’ Forum (PGF), has quit his position as controversy trails the ac­tual date of the national con­vention of the All Progres­sives Congress (APC). The Director-General has vehemently opposed the post­ponement of the convention beyond February and has re­mained critical of the manner the APC Caretaker Extraor­dinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC) has run the party. In one of his write-ups, Lukman fell short of dubbing the CECPC incompetent amid crisis that rocked the party in several states following disput­ed congresses.

The forum also passed a vote of confidence on the CECPC. Daily Independent learnt that, among other things, the meeting of the APC governors deliberated and consented to sacrifice the DG for his uncom­promising position against the CECPC, forcing him to resign. The decision for Lukman to resign did not come easy, a source at the meeting said, as it polarised the governors. A competent source told Daily Independent that while majority of the governors op­posed to the pressure to force Lukman’s resignation, few of the governors insisted on him to go. POLL Effort to speak with the PGF boss was unsuccessful as at the time of filling this report. The Progressive Governors’ Forum had Sunday resolved to proceed with the February convention date even as some members believe the conven­tion should be shifted.
