We will make this a regular initiative and will continue to support them in our own way as a customer and community focused airline in Nigeria,” he said. On the donation to the orphanage homes, Sukh said it has always been the airline’s tradition to support orphanages, NGOs and the needy in the society as he expressed delight with the state of the children. “I hope that their visit to the airport to mingle with our teams gives them some inspiration for the future. Every child is important and it’s our duty to help those that need that little extra support. “‘Our CSR initiative cuts across all communities and sectors, having pioneered sponsorships in sports, breast and prostate cancer awareness, entertainment, and youth empowerment, I think it won’t be out of place to call on the well-meaning citizens of Nigeria to continue to support these worthy causes,” he added.
