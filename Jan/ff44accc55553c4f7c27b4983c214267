Barcelona have geared up for a number of departures this winter transfer window so as to register future players for the club, and with the likes of Samuel Umtiti and Philippe Coutinho rumoured to be on their way out, another name has emerged, potentially to the delight of Culers: Luuk de Jong. As per SPORT, the Dutchman has garnered interest from Turkey with Besiktas and Fenerbahçe both interested in the striker’s signature. Luuk was a truly puzzling signing under the Koeman regime, and his numbers for the Blaugrana have been far from impressive with a subpar two goals from 13 appearances. Indeed, his name was among the first of names that found themselves out of Xavi’s plans and long term project. With the signing of Ferran Torres, Luuk would, as it stands, have a hard time making it into the starting XI, and it is likely beneficial for both parties to look for a move out of Camp Nou. The Dutchman would be the second Barcelona outcast looking at a potential move to Turkey, following in the footsteps of Miralem Pjanic. Unlike the midfielder, however, the striker reportedly isn’t too convinced by a move to Turkey and is instead hoping to join a team in the Premier League. Luuk does, however, have suitors in Netherlands and Italy as well. He was also linked with a move to Cadiz, but the operation failed after the striker rejected them. The operation may, therefore, be slightly more complicated than perceived, especially considering the fact that Barcelona do not technically own Luuk, seeing as he remains on loan from Sevilla. Despite Luuk’s crucial goal against Mallorca, Xavi’s revolution simply doesn’t see him as a crucial contributor. Should he leave the club, the final piece of the Koeman era would depart, and Xavi would have precisely what he requires: a blank slate.
