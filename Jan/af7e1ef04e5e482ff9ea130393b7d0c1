Angel Correa’s brace saw Atletico snap a four-game losing streak in la Liga at the expense of Rayo Vallecano. After a nervy start to the game, Diego Simeone’s side warmed to the task and went in front just before the half-hour mark when Correa reacted quickest amongst a scrum of players, after Mario Hermoso’s shot was blocked, and rifled a shot home from close range. From this point onwards, the result never seemed in doubt and Correa notched another from close range after a fine move which saw Thomas Lemar set free Renan Lodi on the left and he left his striker with an easy task from six yards out.
