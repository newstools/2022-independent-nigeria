Mikel Arteta has been spotted in America alongside Arsenal owner Stan Kroenke as the January transfer deadline begins to loom. The Gunners are yet to sign any first-team players this month, despite failing to record a single victory since the turn of the year. Arteta is keen to bring in a long-term replacement for out-of-favour striker Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang and the club are open to offers for the exiled captain.

Now, the former Manchester City assistant coach has been spotted in America, attending a Colorado Avalanche match, the NHL team that Kroenke owns. It is inevitable that the pair will be discussing potential transfers ahead of next week’s deadline, with alternatives to Vlahovic potentially debated. Arsenal are exploring options including Real Sociedad star Alexander Isak and Lille centre-forward Jonathan David. The former extended his contract with Sociedad towards the tail end of last year in the knowledge that a big-money move to a top club in Europe was likely to happen in the coming months. POLL Isak has a €90million (£75.4million) release clause in his contract, although the Gunners are expected to negotiate that fee. “My clause? We, the players, don’t take too much care of that, it’s more on the side of the clubs. We play and the clubs negotiate with each other,” the Swedish international said back in November.
