LAFIA – A Non-Governmental Organisation (NGO), the Global Initiative for Food Security and Ecosystem for Preservation (GIFSEP), has on Thursday called on Federal Government to consider harmonisation and inclusion of carbon fee into subsidy removal policy in order to lift millions out of poverty. The Executive Director of GIFSEP, Mr. David Michael, who made the called in an interview with Daily Independent in Lafia, described the signing of climate change bill into law, the plan to remove fuel subsidy in February, 2022 and the proposed payment of N5000 to 40 million Nigerians as a major step in implementing the Glasgow Climate Pact. He suggested that to make the policy more comprehensive by including Carbon Fee and Dividend, noted that it would help the Federal Government’s plan to lift 100 million persons out of poverty in ten years.

It’s the policy that climate scientists and economists alike was the best step to reduce the likelihood of catastrophic climate change from global warming as well as empowering the poor through basic climate income. The director of GIFSEP said the Carbon Fee and Dividend also referred to as climate income which was currently operational in Canada, if implemented would help the country to build back stronger from post COVID -19.
