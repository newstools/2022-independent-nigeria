Big Brother Naija season 3 housemate, Leo Da-silva is currently under heavy backlash for aligning with the All Progressives Congress chieftain and presidential aspirant, Bola Ahmed Tinubu. This is coming after the reality star, Leo, took to his various social media handles to share a ‘Bola Tinubu Youth Summit poster with the theme; ‘Reinventing Our Future’ Following the announcement, a lot of Nigerians on social media have stormed the social media page of the reality star, raining insults and accusing him of betraying them for money. Russia Says Expects Written US Response To Security Proposals… U.S., Russia Agree To Keep Talking After Meeting On Ukraine @DanielRegha tweeted, ‘’Leo DaSilva campaigning for Tinubu is extremely disappointing cos he’s one of the few public figures who fought against tyranny, brutality & advocated for a better Nigeria. The sad reality is that a lot of celebs form activists online but dine with our so-called leaders in private.’’ @UlohoRespect wrote, ‘’Leo Dasilva one of the Judas in our midst has shown his true colors, more to reveal themselves as time unfolds. We are observing’’ @Hassanlabir tweeted, ‘’if you assume celebrities represent a people, toh, you’ve already got it wrong from the premise. or maybe you’re right but I know fucking Leo Dasilva doesn’t represent me and that’s why I’m not at all bothered but I guess I understand why you guys are.’’ ‘’It’s clear that the Leo DaSilva is an imbecile of epic proportions. clearly no different from Segalink. The guy is an unwitting pawn and he doesn’t realize it. Profoundly tragic.’’ @adeniran added.
