American goalkeeper Matt Turner is set to join Arsenal as his international manager confirms the latest step in his “incredible story”. Transfer guru Fabrizio Romano reported on Friday morning that the deal to bring Turner to the Emirates Stadium from the New England Revolution is almost complete. As a result of Turner’s arrival, which will occur at the end of the season, current back-up keeper Bernd Leno is set to leave the club in the summer.

USA manager Gregg Berhalter all but confirmed the transfer on Thursday night in his press conference following his side’s win over El Salvador. Speaking to the media, he said: “It’s a great story. He went to Fairfield, was undrafted in MLS, and now he’s playing as a starter with the US national team and he joins Arsenal. It’s an incredible story.” Turner was not selected during the 2016 MLS draft after leaving Fairfield University, having also been playing for fourth tier Jersey Express during the college off-season. He was, however, picked up by New England, before being loaned out to USL side Richmond Kickers for the next two years.
