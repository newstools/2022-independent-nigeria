BENIN  – Ohen elders and members of Ekiugbo community in Uhunwonde Local Gov­ernment Area of Edo State have cried out to the Inspector General Police, Al­kali Usman Baba, over alleged attempt by the Legal Section of the Force CIID, Abuja, to bungle investigation and set free the alleged murder of their son, Ikpomwonsa Omoruyi, by one Justin. The community noted that after a painstaking investigation by the SWAT team, which linked the murder suspect to the death of Ikpomwonsa, they were shocked to observe that the legal section in the force CIID had suddenly resorted to measures unknown to the law to per­vert justice. They appealed to the IGP to order ei­ther the Legal Section of the AIG Zone 5 headquarters Benin to take over the case file as they no longer have confidence in the Legal Section of the Force CIID handling the matter.
