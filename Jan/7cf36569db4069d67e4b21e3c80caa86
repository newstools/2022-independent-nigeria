LAGOS – A Senior Advocate of Nigeria, Mr. Ebun-Olu Adegoruwa, has blamed the recent saga be­tween Lagos State Governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu, and the Nigerian Police on the 1999 Constitution, saying that the constitution does not serve the interest of Nigerians. The senior lawyer noted that the 1999 Constitution tells a lie against the people of Ni­geria when it claims that the country is running a federa­tion but strips the Governor of a state of powers over se­curity. He added that only restruc­turing could save the nation and put an end to these kinds of events in the future.

The CSP told the governor that he and his armed colleagues were in the estate on the orders of the Inspector-General of Police, Usman Baba; as well as the Attorney General of the Fed­eration, Abubakar Malami (SAN). Sanwo-Olu had led mem­bers of his cabinet to visit the residents, who were protest­ing the continuous presence of armed policemen who had besieged the estate since De­cember 2020 in the company of suspected land grabbers and members of a family who had planned to demolish property in the choice estate to execute a Supreme Court judgment. The Governor, after failed attempts to persuade the po­licemen to leave the estate, de­clared their presence illegal, adding that he would make calls to the IGP and the AGF.
