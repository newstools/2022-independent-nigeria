ABUJA – The Peoples Demo­cratic Party (PDP) has said that it has not zoned its presi­dential ticket ahead of the 2023 election. It would be recalled that there were insinuations in some quarters that the party had zoned the ticket to the North. Specifically, the former governor of Niger State, Babangida Aliyu, was re­ported to have said while receiving Atiku Abuba­kar‘s support group, that the PDP had zoned the presidential ticket to the North.

PDP, in a statement by its spokesman, Hon. Debo Ologunagba, said that the statement was completely misleading as it did not in any way represent the party’s position. “For the avoidance of doubt, the PDP emphati­cally and unequivocally states that it has not zoned its presidential ticket to any part of the country. “The PDP is a political party founded on dem­ocratic principles and every action of the par­ty, including zoning, is based on extensive con­sultations, discussions and consideration of all the issues as well as the various tendencies and interests across the na­tion, with the main objec­tive of ensuring that the unity, peaceful co-exis­tence and development of our nation are reinforced and prom, therefore, urg­es Nigerians, our teeming members and supporters to completely disregard the unfounded zoning claims as being peddled. “Our party also cau­tions those behind the claims to desist forth­with,” the party said.
