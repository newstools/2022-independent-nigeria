KATSINA  – Alhaji Mustapha Mu­hammed Inuwa, Secre­tary to the Government of Katsina State (SG), has attributed the lack of syn­ergy among the governors in the North-west and secu­rity agencies as one of the major factor behind the insecurity situation in the region. Inuw, who made this as­sertion at a two day capacity building workshop organ­ised by the Katsina State Correspondents Chapel with the theme, ‘Journalism in the Midst of Insecurity’, opined that, if the governors and security agencies could work together, the menace of insecurity would end in the affected states within a short period of time. “If the state governors and security agencies work together with the desired understanding of the sit­uation and carry out their operations simultaneous­ly, banditry and other se­curity challenges bedev­iling the zone and other regions of the country would end in six months,” he stressed..

He maintained that it was very important for the state Chief Executives to meet regularly to discuss, review issues and arrive at a work plan that they would ensure its implementation as planned. While stressing that the synergy among the securi­ty agencies was also very important, he said this had been lacking, “as you will find the security agencies are doing things different­ly, separately and without understanding. “If security agencies will work together and carry out these operations simultane­ously, believe you me, the way we know this area this thing (banditry) may not last more than six months to finish but unfortunately this has not been taken into consideration.” Comrade Muhammed Garba, the Kano State Com­missioner for Information, in his address, called for the use of technology and additional security person­nel to the north-west region to ward off these menace of Banditry and other crim­inal elements terrorising the zone.
