He said gone were the days when youths after graduation would be waiting on the government to provide them jobs. In his opinion, the youth population must learn to deploy the knowledge gained in school to create a meaningful life for themselves. His words, “the youths should not wait on the government to provide jobs for them. They should learn to work hard and use that knowledge they have acquired to help themselves”. He also said he felt the pains of Nigerians, but wondered why they were not taking advantage of the agricultural opportunities to grow food and become self-sufficient. POLL Buhari also noted that his plans to exit 100million Nigerians out of poverty may have suffered some setbacks, as he noted that funds were required to buy machinery and build infrastructures that would support such course.
