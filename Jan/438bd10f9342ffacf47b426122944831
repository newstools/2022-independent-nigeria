BAUCHI – Following the violence that marred the 21st memorial anniversary of late Baba Peter Gonto on 30th and 31st December 2021, the Bauchi state government has dragged the former Speaker of the House of Representatives, Barrister Yakubu Dogara and 28 others before a Bauchi High Court for 11 count criminal charges. Recall that the former Speaker, Yakubu Dogara had allegedly written a letter to the Inspector General of Police, the Director-General of State Security Services, warning that there was impending security threat if the 21st remembrance anniversary of Baba Gonto was allowed to hold a development that led to accusation and counter-accusations among prominent Sayawa people. The eleven court charge as endorsed by the Chief Registra of the High Court of Bauchi, stated that Yakubu Dogara who is the number one defendant alongside 28 others were accused of conspiring to cause bodily harm to people in the area in order to frustrate the progress of the memorial anniversary.
