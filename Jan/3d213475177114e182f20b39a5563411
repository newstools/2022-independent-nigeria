The African Bar Association has condemned the forceful takeover of government in Burkina Faso by the Armed Forces of the country. President of the African Bar, Mr. Hannibal Uwaifo, in a statement made available to our Correspondent said the unconstitutional and illegal forceful takeover of Government in Burkina Faso represents another ignoble development in the chequered history of Democracy in West Africa. The statement reads in part, “The African Bar Association is saddened by the news of the unconstitutional and illegal forceful takeover of Government in Burkina Faso by the Armed Forces of that Country. This once again represents another ignoble development in the chequered history of Democracy in West Africa. While the Armed Forces may have genuine complaints, using an illegal method to achieve their individual and collective self-desires will not only deepen the insecurity in the country but will add to the bad Governance debacle the citizens are already burdened with.
