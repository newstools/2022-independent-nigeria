ABUJA – National leader of the All Progress Congress (APC), Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, has visited President Muhammadu Buhari to inform him of his intention to vie for the presidential ticket of the party in 2023. He made the disclosure while fielding questions from State House Correspondents after the closed-door meeting at the presidential villa, Abuja. Asked if he has informed Buhari of his ambition, the APC chieftain said: “I will answer that with categorical yes. I’ve informed the President of my intention but I have not informed Nigerians yet.

And I’ve not set a parameter of limitation to the extent of how many people I will consult. You will soon hear, all you want to hear is the categorical declaration. You’ve gotten that truth from me that I have informed Mr President of my ambition, I did not expect more answers than that.” Tinubu, however, declined to comment on his position regarding the Vice President, Yemi Osinbajo whose support groups have been mobilizing for his candidacy. According to him, with what he did in Lagos in his time as governor, he has the capacity to rule Nigeria. On Osinbajo’s potential ambition, Tinubu maintained that he would not discuss any individual. Also asked why he would not remain a kingmaker rather than being the king, he said there is nothing that stops a kingmaker from becoming the king unless he has committed murder.
