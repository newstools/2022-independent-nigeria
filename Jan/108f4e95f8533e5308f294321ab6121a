Players from a minimum of 20 states are expected in Lagos for the first national junior tennis championship of the new tennis season. The Azimuth Shipping Lines Junior Tennis Cham­pionship is hosting talented youngsters for the fourth year and the competition seems to have grown bigger than the previous editions as more play­ers are keen on participating in the age-grade competition. Players like Serena Telu­wo, Mary Udoffa, Seun Ogun­shakin, Mubarak Ganiyu, Gabriel Inyang, Nene Yaku­bu, among others, have risen through the ranks at the tour­nament sponsored by Cap­tain Stephen Owolabi Mar­tins, MD/CEO AZIMUTH Shipping Lines Limited, and this year’s edition looks to be spreading to other states. Djokovic Row: Second Player Loses Visa Over Vaccine Status Injury-Hit Halep Targets Top-10 Return In a brief chat with Ni­geria Tennis Live, Richard Inyang, the tournament di­rector, informed our corre­spondent that the organizers are particularly excited about this year’s edition, especially as Covid-19 prevented them from hosting the 2021 edition. “But we are back this year, and I can authoritatively in­form you that players will be glad they participated in this year’s edition,” Inyang, one of the coaches at the Victoria Gar­den City (VGC) club explained. “Already, we have players from about 20 states, includ­ing Lagos, showing interest in the tournament, and this clearly shows that the com­petition is not something that should be taken with levity. “It is an age grade champi­onship and we are very strict, direct and open with our screening to be sure that play­ers are actually the age they claim to be, and to ensure that the tournament lives up to its billing of discovering talents for the country,” he added. The experienced coach also noted that the competi­tion has the full backing of the Nigeria Tennis Feder­ation (NTF) as they will be sending a representative to the venue of the competition to offer moral support and to also cheer the players. POLL Coaches, players, officials, spectators are expected to ob­serve all Covid-19 protocols to prevent a contraction of the vi­rus which is brewing with se­ries of variants at the moment.
