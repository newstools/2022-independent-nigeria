Counsel to the Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU), Ambrose Alli University (AAU) Ekpoma, Chapter, Mr. Kingsley Obamogie has kicked against the move by the Edo State Attorney General and Commissioner for Justice, Mr. Oluwole Iyamu SAN to transfer the suit challenging the amendment of AAU Laws– Special Intervention Powers Provisions Law 2021 to Benin high court. Obamogie insisted that no cogent, convincing or compelling reason has been advanced by the state government for the said transfer of the suit which is presently pending before the Ekpoma Division of the Edo State High Court. He argued that the claimants, third, fourth and fifth defendants are residents or based in Ekpoma within the Ekpoma Judicial Division of the High Court of Edo State, adding that the university town is, therefore, the forum convenient.

Consequently, the suit can be heard more expeditiously in Ekpoma than Benin; Judges of the High Court of Edo State ply the Benin-Auchi Road to sit at Ehor, Ekpoma, Uromi, Ubiaja, Auchi, Fugar, Agenebode, Igarra, Afuze and Sabongidda-Ora. The Almighty God has been protecting them and the counsel that appears before them and by His grace, He will continue to do so. Obamogie argued that it was cause for concern that up to date, the defendants are yet to file their counter-affidavit and written address in opposition to the claimants’ originating summons filed on 8th November, 2021. According to him, the defendants who are in default of filing their processes cannot be heard to be asking for a transfer of the suit.
