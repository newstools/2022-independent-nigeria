Immediately I was introduced, I quickly po­sitioned myself to pene­trate through the weak Katsina defender.

The league is still open; I will do my best to write my name in gold with the team” “Shooting Stars (3SC) is one of the biggest team in the Nigerian league, with lots of achievements and I see it as a privilege to have an opportunity to be part of the team, to set up another good record” “I don’t really have a target for myself, but I believe at the end of the league I will be among the best players in terms of quality and goal scor­ing, with the support of my teammates to which I dedicate my first goal of the season” “Finally, I appeal to the NFF to look inward into our league and patronise us,” he said.
