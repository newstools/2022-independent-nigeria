AKURE  – Senator Nicholas Towowomo currently representing Ondo South Senatorial District in the Senate has declared that he would rather return home than defect from the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) to All Progressives Congress (APC). He made the declaration on the weekend while distributing 200 laptop computer sets to his constituents. Senator Tofowomo queried what was attractive in APC that would tempt him to defect to it, noting that the APC-led Feder­al Government had ruined the nation’s economy.

They have wrecked the economy of this country. So, it is over my dead body, I can never decamp to APC. It’s PDP in the morning, afternoon and in the evening. “If I leave PDP now, I’m going back home. If you look at the APC, what have they done to improve our economy? When I was in University, 70 kobo would give you one dollar. Now N580 is $1. This showed that they have wrecked the econo­my. So, it is not a party to go to at all. It is an insult to me if I go to APC.
