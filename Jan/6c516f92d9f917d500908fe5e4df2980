BENIN – The Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU), Ambrose Alli University (AAU), Ekpoma Chapter has again called on the vis­itor to the University and Governor of Edo State, Mr. Godwin Obaseki to without further delay constitute a regular Governing Council for the University. The union said this will enhance genuine reposi­tioning of the state-owned institution to do away with the present Special Intervention Team (SIT) which the union alleged was usurping the powers of the council. In a statement on Wednesday in Benin City, the Union stated that the constitution of a normal Governing Council and the sack of the SIT have become necessary because the latter was constituted mostly by some unqual­ified, incompetent and inexperienced persons to preside over the manage­ment of a University.
