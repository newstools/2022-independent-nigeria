Barcelona still hope to sign a new left-back before the end of the January transfer window and reportedly have five names under consideration. 32-year-old Jordi Alba remains the undisputed starter at Camp Nou and he is actually the only senior left-back in the squad, with 18-year-old Alex Balde still seen as too raw for a permanent spot in the first team. Finding some cover for Alba is a top priority for the remainder of the transfer window for Barcelona, and according to prominent Spanish journalist Gerard Romero, there are no fewer than five players being considered for a mid-season switch.

Weirdly enough, it’s acknowledged that none of these are actually Barcelona’s preferred targets for the role. Those in charge at Camp Nou would actually prefer to sign Jose Gaya or Alejandro Grimaldo, of Valencia and Benfica respectively, but the suggestion is that neither is available for transfer midway through the campaign. A lot of this will hinge on the future of right-back Sergino Dest, who is also comfortable playing on the left. The USMNT star is on the transfer list at Barcelona but is keen to stay and fight for his place at the club, despite interest from elsewhere. Chelsea and Bayern Munich have both been linked with Dest and any departure would free up the space, as well as wages, needed to pursue a new natural left-back. POLL There had been hopes that Barcelona could offload centre-back Samuel Umtiti, who recently signed a new contract seemingly to maintain value, but he is now set for an extended period on the sidelines after breaking a bone in his foot during training.
