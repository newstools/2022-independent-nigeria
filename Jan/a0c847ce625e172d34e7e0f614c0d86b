The Nigerai Union of Journalists has applauded the Nigerian Senate for the successful first reading of a bill entitled Advanced Rent (Residential Apartments, Office Spaces, etc) Regulation Bill 2022 which seeks to regulate the payment of rent being imposed by landlords. A statement dated January 21 signed and released by Chris Isiguzo, the National President of NUJ on Friday, described the bill as “timely and welcomed”. The private member bill is sponsored by a former President of Nigeria Union of Journalists, Senator Smart Adeyemi.

Payment of rent is a callous enterprise as landlords exploit the fact that workers don’t have enough to buy their own homes. “It is in the light of above that we support totally, this initiative by our former President which will make rent payment less cumbersome and burdensome for workers. “We believe the National Assembly should expedite action on this progressive bill in order to ameliorate the sufferings of workers who despite the fact that they are paid salaries monthly, greedy Landlords insist on annual payment of rent. Exploiting tenants by landlords who support their acts of victimization by arguing in terms of demand and supply basis is unhealthy, and this tendency must be confronted headlong to reduce the suffering of poor workers”; NUJ posited.
