LAGOS – Prince Kassim Afegbua, a chieftain of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has denied withdrawing the petition  he wrote to anti-graft agencies against the former national chairman of the party, Uche Secondus over alleged N10 billion fraud. Afegbua had last year submitted a petition to the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) and Independent Corrupt Practices and Other Offences Commission (ICPC)  in Abuja seeking serious investigation of the management of the party’s finances. In the petition, Afegbua asked the anti-graft agencies to scrutinize the N10 billion that allegedly accrued to PDP from 2017 till date, especially the money that accrued from sale of nomination forms for presidential, gubernatorial, House of Assembly and senatorial elections.

However speaking with Daily Independent, Afegbua said he is waiting for the anti-graft agencies to conclude their investigations. “Not at all, I didn’t withdraw any petition. It is left for EFCC to conclude their investigation” he said.
