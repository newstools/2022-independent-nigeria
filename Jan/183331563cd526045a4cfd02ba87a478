LAGOS  – Dr. Goodluck Jona­than, former Pres­ident, on Monday, said late Chief Er­nest Shonekan would have solved every problem relating to the 1999 Constitution if he had stayed longer as the head of the Interim National Gov­ernment (ING). Jonathan, who said his only regret about the death of the late Shonekan was that he left the government too early, insisted that if the former Head of State had stayed for about two to three years as the head of the ING, the coun­try wouldn’t be experiencing the controversies trailing the 1999 Constitution. The former President stat­ed this while fielding ques­tions from journalists after he paid a condolence visit to the Shonekan’s residence in Ikoyi, Lagos.

His words: “Chief Er­nest Shonekan is somebody I worked closely with as a member of the Council of States and I learnt so much from him. When I was in of­fice, I was presiding over the Council of States, even as a part timer, in terms of age, I was the youngest among the heads of state. “And when I left office, I also became a member and listening to him, I learnt a lot because he was a man with wisdom, a man with background in the corporate world, a good background in economic issues. “And as a private man, he founded the Nigerian Eco­nomic Summit Group that is still there till today. And for such a man, who had that kind of vision for this country, he was the brain behind Vision 2010, the NLG, these are investments and programmes of the Federal Government that he partici­pated in significantly.
