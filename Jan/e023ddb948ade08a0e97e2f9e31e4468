The Trade Union Congress (TUC), has stated that the Federal Government should ensure that price of rice in the market becomes affordable to the common man in order to boost food security as well as justify the rice revolution policy of the administration. The Labour Center in a communique issued at the end of its National Executive Council meeting, also said the privatisation of the power sector should be reviewed since the contracts have expired to ensure viability, job security and effectiveness of the sector.

The development of the agricultural value chain can create mass employment and put the country on the path of economic recovery and prosperity,” the communique reads. The TUC urged its members nation-wide to obtain their Permanent Voters Cards (PVCs) and ensure active participation in the democratic process ahead of 2023 general elections. “Members are also urged to support the Political Commission of the Congress in creating groundswell awareness for providing leadership alternatives that deliver on democratic dividends and transformative governance to the people,” the communique added.
