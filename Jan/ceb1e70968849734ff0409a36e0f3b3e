P/HARCOURT  – The Federal Government said it was working to establish three modular refineries in each of the oil producing Niger Delta states. It explained that the objective was to halt the illegal artisanal refining activities going on in oil producing areas and its impact on residents in the affected locations. Chief Sharon Ikeazor , the Minister of State for Environment, disclosed this in a statement issued by her ministry in Abuja .

POLL She added: “It is also the intention of government that other artisanal refiners that cannot be absorbed in the pilot modular refineries will be congregated into business clusters and the Alternative Livelihood Fund in the Hydrocarbon Pollution Remediation Project be utilized to set up businesses for them, especially on the management on spent oil to engage them. “These measures will help to drastically reduce the menace of artisanal refining, oil theft and pipeline vandalism to the benefit of our environment and bring prosperity to the oil host communities in the Niger Delta and to our nation at large.” She noted that the menace of artisanal refining, oil theft and pipeline vandalism were largely responsible for the devastating degradation of the Nigerian environment, especially in the Niger Delta region. “In fact, the much talked about Port Harcourt soot is caused by the activities of artisanal refineries due to the indiscriminate ‘cooking’ of stolen crude oil which releases very thick black smoke into the atmosphere, and later settles on surfaces as soot,” Ikeazor stated. Ikeazor said the campaigns were through the agency’s disaster risk reduction programme that focused on the socio-economic implications of artisanal refining, oil theft and pipeline vandalism and the need to bring these illegal activities to an end.
