WARRI – Delta State Governor Ifeanyi Arthur Okowa has begged the people of Delta State to pray for him so that God’s will may be done with regards to his successor in 2023 so he could have the will to obey God and not man. He spoke on Tuesday during a family thanksgiving at the Government House Chapel, Asaba, the State capital. He disclosed that the man who will succeed him will be by the power of God and not his own power, stressing that his successor will be a man who would keep the fire in the altar of God burning to the glory of His name.

He assured that God who spoke before he won the primaries in 2014 was still alive and will speak in a language that he could understand so as not to make mistakes. He charged the people not to mislead him on account of selfish interests but be guided by divine unction so as to do what is right. Okowa noted that he was praying hard for direction and that he was going to follow the leading of heaven, not of the flesh or man so he could finish well and hand over to a worthy successor. The governor added that he was not going to follow a path that will lead to nowhere but to a sure destination that will bring honour to God and blessings to all Deltans. POLL The service was attended by the Deputy Governor, Barr Kingsley Otuaro, Secretary to the State Government, Chief of staff, Commissioners and other top government officials besides traditional rulers.
