BENIN – Joint security personnel have been drafted to wade into herd­ers and farmers clashes, which had provoked outrage in Sec­ond Abumwenre Camp in Ovia North East Local Government Area of the State last Sunday. The security team, compris­ing the Nigeria Army and the Nigeria police were accompa­nied by a team of journalists to visit the multi-ethnic camp on Tuesday after it was reported that the residents of the com­munity were sacked by scores of suspected Fulani herdsmen who allegedly dressed in mili­tary uniform. The said herdsmen report­edly invaded the farming com­munity, chased away the villag­ers and took over their farms, homes and property.
