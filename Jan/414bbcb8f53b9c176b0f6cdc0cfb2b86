LAGOS – Nigeria started the 2021 Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) on a winning note when they piped Egypt 1-0 in their opening group D game. The Super Eagles who started the match the better side outplayed the Pharaohs and deservedly went into the lead in the 30th minute when Leicester City man, Kelechi Iheanaco, fired from outside the box with a ferocious shot which beat the Egyptian goalie. Despite the goal, the three times African champions continued their onslaught with the goal scorer, Ihe­anacho, coming very close before the break. …“33” Export Lager Hails Super Eagles’ Bright Start MTN Backs Pinnick- Led Super Eagles In the second half, Nige­ria continued from where they stopped but were undone by poor finishing as both Moses Simon of Nantes of France and Sam­uel Chukwueze of Villar­real of Spain sustained the pressure from the flanks as the Nigerian side contin­ued to waste chances upon chances. However, as the match continued to wind down, the Pharaohs, buoyed by their slim trailing of the Super Eagles, gradually came into the match with dominant displays. Their danger man, Mo­hammed Salah, came close to leveling proceedings twice but failed to connect the ball very well after he was put through by El-Neny. At other time, the Liverpool attacker was flagged offside as sustained their pressure to equalize to no avail. Not even the four minutes added time could produce further goals from both sides as Su­per Eagles won the tie. Meanwhile, Nigeria will next face Sudan before meeting Guinea Bissau as part of group games.
