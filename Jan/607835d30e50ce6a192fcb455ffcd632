LAGOS -The Centre for the promotion of Private Enterprise (CPPE), has appealed to the finance minister to review the recent provisions to Tax Appeal Tribunals rules compelling those who have tax disputes to pay 50 per cent of the amount in dispute before their appeal can be heard. Dr Muda Yusuf, the Chief Executive, CPPE, while speaking with select journalist in Lagos on the state of the nation’s economy, said: “We submit that this is contrary to the principle of natural justice, it constitutes an obstruction to fair hearing. “We therefore, call on the finance minister to review this policy urgently. Besides, the rule is in conflict with the FIRS Establishment Act that setup the tribunal.

These include the Education Tax, Information Technology tax, Police Fund levy, and the Tertiary Healthcare Fund levy recently passed by NASS among others. This is in addition to the burden of dealing with multiple tax agencies from FIRS to States IRS, Customs, etc all trying to collect revenue and conduct tax audits. These taxes should be harmonized,” he said.
