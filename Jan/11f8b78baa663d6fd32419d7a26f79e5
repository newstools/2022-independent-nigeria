LAGOS  – Chief Ike Shorunmu, the former Super Ea­gles goalkeeper and coach, has warned the national team coaches to beware of the Black Stars of Ghana ahead of the potential FIFA World Cup qualifying playoff in March.

The Black Stars, it would be recalled, fell flat at the AFCON, failing to go beyond the group stage as unfancied Comoros Island booked the round of 16 ticket at their expense and Sho­runmu said all these would pale into insignificance when they file out against the Super Eagles in March for the World Cup qualifying playoff.
