Manchester City’s long winning run in the Premier League ended at 12 matches on Saturday after a 1-1 draw at Southampton, which took points off the leaders for the second time this season. City needed a 65th-minute header by Aymeric Laporte to earn a point at St. Mary’s, after Southampton took the lead through Kyle Walker-Peters. Pep Guardiola’s team had won every game in the league since a 2-0 home loss to Crystal Palace on Oct. 30.

Southampton’s players defended stoutly after the break, just like they did when collecting a 0-0 draw at Etihad Stadium in September. And they were dangerous on the counterattack, especially through Armando Broja, who had a goal disallowed for offside and also headed against a post. City extended its lead over Liverpool to 12 points but has played two more games than the Reds, who visit Palace on Sunday.
