ABUJA  – Monthly rent in the nation’s capital has been projected as a better option to recalibrate the Abuja property market index, according to the Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC). The labour organisation made this known while expressing its total support for the bill at the National Assembly aimed at outlawing yearly rent in the Federal Capital Territory (FCT). According to the NLC, the bill on monthly rent introduced by the Senator representing Kogi West Senatorial District in the Nigerian Senate, Senator Smart Adeyemi, is titled “Advanced Rent (Residential Apartments, Office Spaces, etc.) Regulation Bill 2022” and has gone through the first reading at the floor of the Nigerian Senate.

This is aimed at providing legal support for Nigerians especially workers who do not own houses of their own and thus are most times exposed to the greed of shylock landlords,” the NLC president said. He stated that the private member bill is an improvement on the Lagos Tenancy Law, which, under Section, 4 on Advance Rent, outlaws the payment of rent in excess of six months and one year. The bill, he explained further is also in tandem with the rent regime in most parts of the world, especially as it obtains in contemporary African countries, including South Africa and Kenya. The labour leader said Nigerian workers welcome this legislative initiative by Senator Smart Adeyemi, who is also a comrade as a former president of the Nigeria Union of Journalists (NUJ), an affiliate of the NLC.
