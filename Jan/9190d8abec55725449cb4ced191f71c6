American film director, film producer, writer, and actor Spike Lee will receive the lifetime achievement award for distinguished achievement in motion picture direction from the Directors Guild of America. The group announced Lee as the recipient of the organization’s top honour on Wednesday morning. “Icon. Trailblazer. Visionary. Spike Lee has changed the face of cinema, and there is no single word that encapsulates his significance to the craft of directing,” said Lesli Linka Glatter, president of the DGA. “From his groundbreaking ‘Do the Right Thing,’ ‘BlacKkKlansman’ and everything in between — to his signature ‘double dolly’ shot, Spike is an innovator on so many levels. His bold and passionate storytelling over the past three decades has masterfully entertained, as it held a stark mirror to our society and culture.” Funke Akindele, Omoni Oboli, Others Celebrate With AY Over New… Flomat Books Opens New Outlet Lee will be honoured with the lifetime achievement award at the DGA’s 74th annual awards ceremony on March 12.
