Leadway Assurance, has ex­tended its flagship Agric-in­surance cover to cover crop farmers for losses incurred due to cattle grazing encroach­ment into their farmlands. This unique and timely pol­icy is in response to the plight of farmers who have suffered huge financial losses arising from the destruction of their crops and farmlands during en­croachment by nomadic cattle. According to Mr. Ayoola Fa­tona, Head, Agric and Micro In­surance, Leadway Assurance, the extended policy coverage will encourage continued in­vestments in farming to pre­vent nationwide food security. NYSC Gets Commendation On Innovative Service Delivery Absence of Governing Council Hindering AAU Progress, ASUU… “As a leading risk bearer and insurance service provid­er especially for the agribusi­ness sector, we aim to provide top-notch service, satisfy our esteemed farmers, agribusi­ness investors with our dy­namic, bespoke and compre­hensive insurance solutions. The call by farmers for us to extend insurance cover to include the risk of cattle en­croachment has been grow­ing over the years, and in our usual characteristic manner of responding to the needs of our customers, we decided to cover the peril of cattle en­croachment as an extension to our existing crops policy. “Our existing crops policy covers farmers at the time of loss, mostly against natural perils like flood, drought, windstorm, prolonged dry spell etc. The farmers who suffer losses relating to ani­mal encroachment would get compensated with the deploy­ment of this exemplary risk management tool. It is a win-win solution for the farm­ing ecosystem and the food consuming population in Nigeria. With this audacious step, there is no gainsaying that Leadway Assurance is poised to make farming an endeavour that bears peace of mind, despite the increas­ing farmers-herders’ conflicts that dominate the agricultur­al sector in Nigeria today.” Mr. Fatona added.
