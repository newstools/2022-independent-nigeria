Andy Bond, the chief executive of the owner of British discount retailer Poundland, is to step down because of health reasons at the end of March, less than a year after leading a 5 billion euros ($5.7 billion) flotation of the business. Pepco Group, which also owns European discount retailer brands PEPCO and Dealz, said on Wednesday it has appointed Trevor Masters, currently group chief operating officer, to the role of interim CEO from March 31. The board will immediately start a search process with external support and will evaluate internal and external candidates for the role of CEO.

The group was listed on the Warsaw Stock Exchange in May 2021. Prior to joining Pepco, Bond was the boss of the UK supermarket group Asda. “Every great journey must come to an end and it is with much reluctance that I have decided now is the right time to focus my energies on my health,” said Bond. He will remain an advisor to the Pepco board until the end of the financial year.
