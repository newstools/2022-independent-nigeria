LAGOS  – In other countries, elec­tions are simple processes and routines; people go to the polling units, vote and go back to their businesses. But that is not the case in Nigeria where elections are a matter of life and death. Elections are like wars and people get injured and die. The November 6, 2021, Anambra State gubernato­rial election has come and gone but some people in the state are still reeling from the losses they suffered during and after the election. The Bernard Nwankwo family is yet to get over the loss it suffered before the election. On October 10, 2021, Akachukwu Nwank­wo was caught in a fracas between Nigerian soldiers and members of the Indig­enous People of Biafra; she was injured and taken to Oko Community Hospital, where she later died.
