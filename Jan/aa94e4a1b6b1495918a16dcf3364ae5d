A North Carolina man, Danny Sims said his family’s tendency for pranking each other has made it difficult to convince them he had won a $250,000 lottery prize. Sims, 43, of Ellenboro, told Carolina Education Lottery officials that he bought a ‘20X The Cash scratch-off ticket’ from the Key Largo Food Mart in Mooresboro, only to realise he had actually won. “It took me a while to realise I actually won something after the shock wore off, I was so excited I had tears in my eyes.” Sims said Kogi: Angry Mob Sets Police Barrack Ablaze Over Slain Boy NAWOJ Advocates Justice For Hanifa, Others According to him, Sims initially thought he had won $25, but soon realized he had scored a $250,000 jackpot. “I just froze and thought, ‘Oh my God, I thought it couldn’t be real. It was so hard to believe,” he said. After recovering from the shock, Sims said he tried to tell his family about his good fortune, but convincing them he was telling the truth turned out to be a near-impossible task. “We are pranksters, we are always pranking each other, so they thought I was just messing with them,” He said. In order to convince them he stated that he would use some of the prize money to help pay off his stepfather’s house.
