LAGOS – In the wake of incidences of blatant ambush marketing and intentional deceptive advertising by some businesses, targeted at illegitimately identifying with the Super Eagles and the team’s campaign at the 33rd Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) ongoing in Cameroon, the Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) on Tuesday assured Coca-Cola Nigeria Limited of full protection of its partnership rights. President of the NFF and FIFA Council Member, Mr. Amaju Pinnick flew out of Cameroon to Lagos to deliver the words of assurance to the soft drinks behemoth, reiterating that the NFF would not hesitate to drag businesses infringing on the rights of Coca-Cola, and indeed any of NFF’s partners and sponsors, to the law courts. “We are unhappy with the behaviour of these companies that went to town in a bid to intentionally identify with the Super Eagles when they have no such right or leeway. It is most condemnable.
