We could be looking at Gareth Bale’s final months for Real Madrid. The prevailing thought is that this will mainly hinge on the status of the Welsh national team qualifying for the 2022 World Cup, According to an article by David Ornstein of The Athletic. At 32, Bale’s career began under the tutelage of George Burley at Southampton FC. He came to Real Madrid via the Tottenham Hotspurs in 2013 and, minus a season long stint back at Tottenham, has been here ever since. It is no secret that his past few seasons have been plagued with injury with Bale. In his 20/21 season at Tottenham, Bale had 20 appearances (10 of which were as substitute) of a possible 38 matches. At Real Madrid this season, he has racked up a total of three appearances out of a possible 19 La Liga matches. While an exit during the Winter transfer window doesn’t seem likely, there have been no indications of either side negotiating for an extension on his contract.
