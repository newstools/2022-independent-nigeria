Newcastle United have reportedly made a big offer for Atalanta wing-back Robin Gosens, tripling his current salary, La Dea don’t want to sell. Gosens has been sorely missed so far this season, as he has been out of action since suffering a serious muscular injury on September 29. They failed to reach the Champions League Round of 16 and instead will fight it out to enter the Europa League.

It’s reported he has accepted the personal terms, a three-and-a-half-year contract worth €3.5m net per season. That would effectively triple his current salary in Bergamo. Newcastle are certainly not short on cash after the takeover from Saudi investment fund PIF, but Atalanta are top four in Serie A and aiming to qualify for the Champions League for the fourth season running. Since his arrival in 2017, Gosens has contributed 29 goals and 21 assists in 157 competitive matches for La Dea and they are in no rush to let him leave.
