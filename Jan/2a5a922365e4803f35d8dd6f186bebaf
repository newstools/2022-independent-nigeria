Without doubts; Sijibomi Ogundele, the architectural sensational is redefining luxury building in Nigeria with his fast-rising real estate and construction firm, Sujimoto. His success secret, however, is his belief in the above quote. While others shut down and went on break for the yuletide, the very intelligent construction giant was busy re-strategising with the sole aim of remaining the leader in the sector. This quintessential real estate merchant is determined to dominate the scene for a long time to come, and he has continued to back his projection with visible, convincing and laudable facts: this is evident in the number of projects he has so far handled since he ventured into the business. A few years into the sector, his accomplishments have surpassed many others who had been in the industry long before him. Ogundele can be described as a man gifted with the Midas touch, showing no signs of slowing down at all, while he has set a goal and mission for himself in 2022 and beyond to rub shoulders with other world-class real estate giants across the globe. He is building an intimidating profile that will be difficult for anyone to beat in this part of the world. He is not resting on his oars until he achieves this with a steely resolve to further transform and revamp the nation’s real estate sector to compete with the rest of the world, in terms of quality, affordability and luxury homes. It was also hinted that his new building Sujimoto’s Lucrezia De Medici (Maisonettes and Penthouses) at Banana Island is expected to be delivered this year.
