Top of the list of stars set for Old Trafford exits is Anthony Martial, with the French forward’s fall from grace at the club well documented. The striker arrived in Manchester with a bang in 2015, scoring on his debut against Liverpool before bagging a brace in his second game against Southampton, but he has since struggled for form and fallen out of favour. The Frenchman has scored just eight goals in his last 46 matches for the Red Devils, and both Ole Gunner Solskjaer and Ralf Rangnick have favoured the likes of Mason Greenwood and Edinson Cavani. Martial Wishes To Leave Man-Utd In January, Says Agent Ronaldo vs  Messi Facing Potential Showdown With PSG Possible… A loan move to Spanish side Sevilla had been touted, however the two clubs couldn’t reach an agreement and United are now having to look elsewhere to offload the forward. Their hunt for potential suitors has lead them to a possible swap deal involving Barcelona star Ousmane Dembele, as per Catalan outlet Ara. The report states that the La Liga side have approached United about the proposal, with Dembele also having struggled to impress in Barcelona due to both injuries and poor form. The Frenchman has played just 126 times in four years since joining the Catalan side from Borussia Dortmund, and Barca boss Xavi is prepared to let the forward leave before his contract expires at the end of the season. The Spanish side are in a delicate financial situation at present, and a swap deal could allow them to bolster their ranks and add attacking threat without costing them a penny. POLL The recent acquisition of Ferran Torres from Manchester City could prove costly, with the fee possibly rising as high as £54 million, and Barca are therefore wary that they may not be able to afford further transfer fees.
