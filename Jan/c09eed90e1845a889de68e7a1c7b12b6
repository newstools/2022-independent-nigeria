We remain committed to providing access to affordable and reliable mobility options at any time and for everyone.” Users will be able to see the booking fee before the journey begins, and it will also appear on their receipts afterwards. Uber is not the only ride-hailing company to introduce this new booking fee. Earlier this month, Bolt also introduced a 3% booking fee to cover operational costs and the improvement of features on the Bolt app. Riders have resorted to social media to express their dissatisfaction with how pricing on the ride-hailing app continues to rise with each journey. Users of the Uber app have also noticed a pricing increase, particularly around the festive season. In April, Professional E-hailing Drivers and Private Owners Association (PEDPA), which represents Uber and Bolt drivers, called on e-hailing companies to raise their fares to reflect the current economic state in the country.
