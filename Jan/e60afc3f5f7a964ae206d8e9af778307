Former Kano State Governor, Rabiu Kwankwaso, says he has no regret supporting Governor Abdullahi Ganduje to succeed him as the Chief Executive of the state. During his appearance on Channels Television’s Sunday Politics, Senator Kwankwaso spoke about his relationship with Governor Ganduje in the past, as well as how they both worked together until 2015. “I have no regret whatsoever because we are still strong, much stronger than 2015. Not only in Kano but across the country and beyond,” he said.

When Ganduje became governor, Kwankwaso was a Senator representing Kano Central Senatorial District in 2015. Though elected on the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), his then deputy, Abdullahi Ganduje, succeeded him in 2015 as the candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC). “He (Ganduje) was my deputy from 1999 to 2003 and, of course, my SA when I was the Minister of Defence and thereafter in 2007, I lobbied the then President Yar’Adua and, of course, he got a job in the Chad Republic to be the Executive Secretary of Chad Basin,” the governor said. “He was there when I got a ticket in 2010. I asked him to resign and come back to Nigeria to be my deputy. When I was going, I thought we should have an inclusive government by supporting him to become governor.” POLL Source: Channels Tv
