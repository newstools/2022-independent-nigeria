I ThankGod for my instincts.

Huspuppi made people feel they are not doing well despite their achievements. “I understand the APC government increased level of joblessness in our country Nigeria but that is not a justification for crime. A lot of youths who were not contented ended up joining fraud. “Today they are regretting it because they now know that no matter how long you enjoy crime money, regrettable time will surely come. Huspuppi’s lifestyle and the final US judgment on him should be studied in school so our students, youths can understand the danger of being a fraudster. “I just heard US Court will sentence Hushpuppi on Valentine’s Day. Whichever the outcome of that judgment will be, Huspuppi killed himself the moment he signed up for the crime.” POLL Recall that The Federal Bureau of Investigation, FBI, had arrested Hushpuppi a few years ago for alleged advanced fee fraud.
