Concerned Jere Progressive Group (COJEPG) and the entire supporters of Hon Ahmed Satomi, member Federal House of Representative (Jere constituency of Borno State) expressed shock over the incident, described the report on social media as unsubstantiated claims and baseless. Leader of COJEPG, Comrade Mustapha Kwali Kwali at a press briefing in Maiduguri today who in the company of his members said, ” we categorically exonerate our own Federal Lawmaker, Hon Satomi from such act, giving the fact that, the Lawmaker who has been doing all he could to better the lives of the people of the state before, during when he was the Chairman of Borno State Emergency Management Agency, SEMA, and as well, after he became the federal lawmaker representing the good people of Jere, is unprecedented and a welcome development by all and sundry. ” It is worrisome that some who chose do be paid critics against Satomi for no justifiable reason took to their social media platforms, especially Facebook pages. “This incident and social media posts against our Lawmaker is shameless, as Hon Satomi’s Facebook account was hacked for more than one year, and he chose not to be on Facebook. “We are particularly shocked to also came across posts doctored by same critics who wrote, shared or neither posted on behalf of the owner of the restaurant, Fadila  Abdulraham with all sorts of accusations against our Lawmaker. “To this end, in as much as we don’t want to join issues with some social media users who are hellbent, to cut the story short for clarity purpose, we urge the general public to please disassociate themselves from these baseless and unsubstantiated claims, as our federal Lawmaker, Hon Satomi will never be distracted in his quest to better the lives of Jereians, the good people of Borno and by extension Nigerians as a whole.
