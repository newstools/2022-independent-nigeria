Southeast and Ndi Igbo in general has contributed so much in socio economic growth and development of Nigeria.” “Southeast and Ndi Igbo in general has globally acceptable personalities that are educationally, economically, socially capable. They also parades young energetic and politically sagacious individuals who take Nigerians to greater heights as their President even in time like this.” “However, any individual or organization that does not in any way support zoning of 2023 Nigerian President to southeast or Ndi Igbo is an enemy of progressive and a united Nigeria. Such people do not have the moral right to criticize those clamouring for power to remain in the North 2023 because equity and fairness favours southeast and Ndi Igbo in general. “We call upon the likes of His Excellency Mr. Peter Obi , Hon Emeka Nwajiuba and His Excellency Rt. Hon. Chibuike Amaechi to declare their intention to run for 2023 presidency or we will build tent in their houses until they do so” the National Coordinator stated.
