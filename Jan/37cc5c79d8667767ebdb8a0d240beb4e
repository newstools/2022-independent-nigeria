Against the backdrop of the People’s Democratic Party, PDP, pushing hard to reclaim power in 2023, the All Progressives Congress, APC, says it would not only retain power at the national but win the governorship in Rivers State. Speaking the mind of the party on Sunday at Ogba/Egbema/Ndoni local government area of Rivers state, leader of the APC in the state, former Senator Magnus Abe said the party will take over power from the PDP in Rivers State. Senator Abe who was at ONELGA to inaugurate a political group known as Rivers Voice of freedom, RIV, tasked the APC members across the country to work hard for the dream to be a reality.

According to him, “some people said the problem of our party in Rivers State is because Senator Magnus Abe wants to be Governor. You all the truth. It this party, we will work for peace. But if they bring war, we will work for victory”. Senator Abe informed his supporters at the event that crisis had never bred victory but only peace could afford the party the dream of every member in Rivers State and Nigeria generally in 2023. Earlier in his remarks, former Senator Wilson Ake assured members of RIV that senator Magnus Abe was “destined to be the next Governor of Rivers State”, adding that the national leader of APC, Bola Ahmed Tinubu would succeed Muhammadu Buhari as President.
