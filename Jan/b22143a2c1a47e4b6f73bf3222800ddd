Pastor Enoch Adeboye, General Overseer of The Redeemed Christian Church of God (RCCG), has advised individuals to approach the year with determination to offer thanks despite the challenges they might encounter. Adeboye, prior to his sermon last Sunday at the National Headquarters, Ebute Metta, Lagos, led the congregation in offering prayer of thanksgiving for 2021 and the new year, while asking that it be a year of double miracles, blessings and testimonies. He encouraged worshipers to stand on God’s promises, instead of showing despair when it looks like God was taking long to answer their prayers. Remembering God’s Generals Who Answered The Last Call In 2021 Focus On Productivity, Akinadewo Tells Christians “You must approach this new year with a determination, that no matter what is happening you will give thanks. Even if you are hungry still give thanks. If you are hungry it is a sign of being alive. Dead people don’t hungry so give thanks. “Even when you don’t have new clothes, still give thanks. Only mad people are considered to wear rags. Thank God that your head is still correct. What if people hate you? Still give thanks. It doesn’t matter who hates you, be thankful because God loves you. “What if the answers to your prayers are delayed? Still give thanks, God has His timetable. If He delayed the answer in 2021, He might be preparing it for 2022. At times when God delays an answer to your prayer, it might be because He has something superior to give you. “Any prayer you pray, that God knows will end badly for you, may He never answer. Once God Has said something, He is surely going to do on it. But, the taller a building will be, the deeper the foundation. So, if God Has promised you something major, it might take a little time but it will come to pass,” Adeboye stated. He reminded the worshipers to stay away from sins, for their prayers not to be futile.
