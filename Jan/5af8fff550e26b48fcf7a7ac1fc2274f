Wolverhampton have won their first match at Old Trafford against Manchester United since 1980 courtesy of a Joao Moutinho strike in the 82nd minute of the match where the Red Devils were second best from start to finish. Wolves substitute Adama Traore sent a cross into the Man United area but long-lost defender Phil Jones headed it out of the box but it was met by Joao Moutinho unleashed a half-volley into the bottom corner from 20 yards out to send the away fans into a delirious celebration, and the Old Trafford crowd, into silence.
