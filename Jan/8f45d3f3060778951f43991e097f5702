In addressing current challeng­es and trends of the tourism industry, the United Nations World Tourism Organisation (UNWTO) is focusing on in­novation, education, digital transformation and invest­ments as strategies to apply in generating new business opportunities that will ensure global competitiveness, growth and sustainable development of the tourism sector. This was in line with the vision and objectives of the Secretary General of the UN­WTO, Mr. Zurab Pololikashvili, as part of his new priorities to harness innovation and digital advances that would provide tourism with the opportunities to improve inclusiveness, local community empowerment and efficient resource management within a wider sustainable de­velopment agenda. According to a release signed by the National Presi­dent of Institute for Tourism Professionals of Nigeria, Chief Abiodun Odusanwo, “To achieve the set objectives, the UNWTO is proposing hosting of forums by sectoral stake­holders of the industry across the globe at local, national, re­gional and international levels to create synergy through col­laborative actions between gov­ernments, academia, corporate organisations, micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs), investors, business support partners, etc., to provide un­derstanding of current social trends and customer needs.” Rep Commends Akeredolu’s Commitment To Security In Ondo UAMC Holds 80th Annual Conference Back here in Nigeria, the ITPN had been cashing in on the digital transformation quest of the UNWTO to drive the nation’s tourism industry with a collaborative partner­ship with the Federal Ministry of Communication and Digi­tal Economy and its agencies aimed at, not only to serve the digitalisation needs of the tour­ism industry, but help achieve the goals of the Ministry in the promotion of digitalization in every sector of the Nigerian economy.
