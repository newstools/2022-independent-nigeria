Arsenal supporters seem almost entirely in agreement with manager Mikel Arteta in their apparent shared admiration of Leicester City midfielder Youri Tielemans. The Belgium international has entered the final 18 months of the four-year contract signed when the loan move from Monaco was made permanent in July 2019, and interest from Premier League rivals is building with the January transfer window open. Liverpool have also been reported as interested in the 24-year-old recently, but that speculation has been dismissed for this winter CBS Sports journalist Ben Jacobs, with Arsenal said to be the “one to watch”.

In the final third he got the KDB devastation. I’m just worried about his defensive ability – particularly in transition. Don’t think he’s the right profile for us, as amazing as he is. Gary Griffin: Tielemans is a proper modern midfielder, can do everything tackle press score vision he’s got the lot. I remember watching him at Anderlecht 18 years old playing in the Champions League. I knew he was top class even then. POLL I’ve always wanted him at Arsenal even before Leicester spent 35 million on him. B Terty: Doubt we get Tielemans. Malcolm Teel: Get Tielemans, underrated aspect is his penalty-taking, something we haven’t been too good at this season. Gregory Bealer: If Tielemans could be obtained I’d be most happy as he’s proven good in the PL.
