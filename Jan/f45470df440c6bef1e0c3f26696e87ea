Arsenal coach Mikel Arteta has wished Ainsley Maitland-Niles well following his move to Jose Mourinho’s Roma. The 24-year-old Englishman landed in Rome earlier this afternoon after signing for the Giallorossi on a six-month dry loan deal, giving him the chance to prove his worth after struggling for minutes in North London. Speaking to gathered reporters in a press conference earlier today, Arteta discussed Maitland-Niles’ move to Roma and his decision to leave Arsenal.

We already had this conversation in the summer and we decided to keep him at the club and assess the situation in December, but with the amount of minutes that he has played, he’s entitled to that opportunity. “When a player feels that way and has a strong argument like he has, it’s very difficult to turn it away, so we decided to let him go and we wish him all the best.” The 24-year-old Maitland-Niles, who is contracted to Arsenal until 2023, has made only 11 appearances across all competitions this season for the Gunners, for a total of 472 minutes. In that time, he has provided one assist, making only two Premier League starts. With the Englishman joining the Giallorossi on a dry loan, he’ll be returning to North London at the end of the season. This gives him the chance to shine under Mourinho in an attempt to win back a spot in the Arsenal squad.
