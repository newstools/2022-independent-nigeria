The Arewa Consultative Forum (ACF) has said that Indigenous People of Biafra IPOB’s pronouncement to ban the singing of the National Anthem and the transportation of livestock to the south-east is a declaration of war. The National Publicity Secretary of the ACF, Emmanuel Yawe, who commented on the plan by the Amalgamated Union of Foodstuff and Cattle Dealers of Nigeria to ban the movement of foodstuffs from the north to the south-east noted that the order by IPOB was unnecessary as Nigeria was not at war, enjoining all well-meaning Nigerians to call the Biafra agitators to order. He described as justifiable the fear and concerns of the Amalgamated Union of Foodstuff & Cattle Dealers of Nigeria following the threat by the IPOB.

Somebody should call IPOB to order. We are still one country and not at war. Their pronouncements amount to an open declaration of war,” he added.
