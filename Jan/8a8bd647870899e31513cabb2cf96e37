The provisional death toll has risen to at least 48 in ongoing armed clashes in northeastern Syria around a prison run by Kurdish-Syrian forces, where thousands of ISIS fighters are being held, said the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR). It said the clashes are still underway near Ghweiran prison in the northeastern region of Hasake. US military helicopters are flying over the area in search of approximately 80 escaped prisoners, says the Observatory, which uses a dense network of local sources.

The ISIS fighters started the prison attack during the night, but clashes have continued into Friday. The fighters have positioned themselves in an area of Hasake near the prison and are using civilians as human shields, local sources said.
