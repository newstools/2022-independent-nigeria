Zenith Labour Party (ZLP) has praised Imo State Governor Hope Uzodinma for not exposing the names of the sponsors of insecurity in the state. This was disclosed by the party’s national chairman, Chief Dan Nwanyanwu, on Thursday in a statement released in Abuja. According to the statement, Uzodinma’s decision to expose the sponsors will amount to opening the window of escape by the culprits and by refusing to do so, he has blocked the route for the said sponsors to escape.

This escape they would have achieved through court processes. “For those who are attacking the governor for not naming and shaming the culprits are the same people that are involved and are condemning the governor because the route of escape has been blocked.” “The Imo State citizens are aware of those who looted their treasury. They also know the sponsors of terrorism in the state. The fact cannot change.” The party further advised the governor to give the police the chance to finish their investigation and charging suspected sponsors to court without recourse to anybody.
