Roberto Martinez is interested in returning to Everton but has terms when it comes to taking the job, according to reports. The Toffees sacked Rafa Benitez on Sunday just a day after losing 2-1 to Norwich City at Carrow Road. Now, owner Farhad Moshiri is examining his options as he gears up for yet another managerial appointment. Everton had high hopes for Benitez when they appointed him as a replacement for Carlo Ancelotti back in the summer. Ancelotti left for Real Madrid and the Spaniard was seen as the ideal candidate to take over and make Goodison Park a fortress again.

Martinez is on their shortlist, six years after he became the first manager of the Moshiri era to lose his job. POLL Though he’s currently contracted to the Belgium national team, the Daily Mail say there’s still a chance the 48-year-old will come back. It’s stated Martinez doesn’t want any role at Goodison to be on an interim basis, and would instead prefer to return permanently. He has a £2million release clause in his Belgium contract, which is due to expire after the World Cup later in the year. Yet Martinez wants Belgium’s blessing, too, if he’s to make a sensational comeback. The Red Devils want to keep him amid talks with Everton yet there’s a sense that, with the Spaniard’s deal winding down, they could be forced into negotiating a departure instead.
