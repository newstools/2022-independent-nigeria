ABUJA – The Nigeria Agricultural Quarantine Service (NAQS) has clarified that Donkey Hide remains on the Export Prohibition List, stressing that the resumption of the certification of that commodity for export hinges on the rebound of the Nigerian donkey herd which is still classified as an endangered species. Reacting to a news report that erroneously suggested that NAQS had resumed the certification of Donkey Skin for export, the Director General of the agency, Dr. Vincent Isegbe in a statement on Tuesday, pointed out that the Agency met with all the relevant associations in September 2021 to chart a course toward restocking the donkeys through breeding and ranching in order to put the animals beyond the threat of extinction. Isegbe added that the government would consider delisting Donkey Hide from the contraband category only after the scale has tilted in favour of the recovery of the Nigerian donkeys.
