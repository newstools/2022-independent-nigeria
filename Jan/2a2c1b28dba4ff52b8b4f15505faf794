ABUJA – A civil society organisation under the aegis of Vanguard for Transparent Leadership and Democracy (VATLAD), has criticised the National Assembly for referring the Electoral Act Amendment Bill 2021 to President Muhammadu Buhari for his reconsideration and possible assent. The group which has threatened to commence legal action against NASS, however, clarified that the back and forth movement of the bill negates the constitutional provisions of section 4 (1) of the 1999 Nigerian Constitution, as amended, which unambiguously states that the constitutional lawmaking for Nigerians and Nigeria is exclusively that of the Legislature, in this case, the National Assembly. According to Igbini Emmanuel, National President of VATLAD, it is not a shared duty between the Executive and the Legislative Arms to enact such laws.

It is now entirely left exclusively to members of the Senate and House of Representatives to complete the final process of making this Bill become an Act by simply remobilising yourselves as you reportedly did in the passage of the Bill to meet the required two-thirds majority of the total of four hundred and sixty-nine members to pass this Bill to become an Act of the Federal Republic of Nigeria. POLL “In June 2000, this was exactly the process followed by the National Assembly in establishing the NDDC Act after then President Obasanjo withheld his assent,” the Civil Society Group emphasised in its statement made available to Saturday independent.
