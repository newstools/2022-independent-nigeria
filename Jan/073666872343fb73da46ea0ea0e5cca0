ABUJA – Former President of Senate, Anyim Pius Anyim has described the late Bashir Tofa as an apostle of politics without bitterness. He said the late elder statesman and veteran politician was a “committed Nigerian who throughout his more than 40 years of active partisan politics demonstrated his strong belief in politics of accommodation and consensus-building. “He was so committed to a peaceful Nigeria that throughout the electioneering campaigns leading to the 1993 presidential elections, in which he was the candidate of the National Republican Convention (NRC), Alhaji Tofa never did anything, in words or actions, that could have instigated crisis in any form.” Anyim commends Alhaji Tofa’s “politics without bitterness” and strongly recommends such disposition to politicians of today in the interest of the peace, unity and harmony of our dear country even as we approach the 2023 general elections. In a statement signed by Sam Nwaobasi, Media Adviser to the former Number Three Man, Anyim expressed regret that Tofa died when his experience and elderly counsel would be most needed as the country battles with multiple challenges. Anyim condoled with the late Tofa’s family, the good people of Kano State and Tofa’s many friends and associates all over Nigeria. He also prayed that the Almighty God would grant the soul of Alhaji Tofa eternal rest.
