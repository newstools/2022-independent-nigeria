To compound the economic challenges of COVID-19 pandemic, business activities were disrupted by the End-SARS protests.” POLL It further stated that the deployment of technological tools was a game-changer for the Service. “Upon the coming into office of the current management, the Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS) began strategic administrative and operational reforms; and the implementation of new policies that would improve its capacity towards the fulfilment of its mandate. “The deployment of a new automated tax administration system, the “TaxPro Max” in June 2021 was a game-changer. With the solution, taxpayers experienced ease of registration, reporting, payment and issuance of Tax Clearance Certificates while the Service experienced greater efficiency in the deployment of resources thereby leading to improved revenue collection.” The FIRS stated that strong opposition to its statutory mandates by certain interests posed a major setback in the full implementation of its reforms.
