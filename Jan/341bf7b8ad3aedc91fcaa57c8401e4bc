AKURE – Ondo State Governor Rotimi Akeredolu has appointed the Commander, Ondo State Security Network, otherwise known as Amotekun Corps, Akogun Adetunji Adeleye, as his Special Adviser on Security Matters. This was contained in a statement by the governor’s Chief Press Secretary, Richard Olatunde, on Tuesday in Akure, the state capital. According to the statement, the new appointment which took immediate effect, would not affect the position of Adeleye as the Commander of the Amotekun Corps in the state.

Meanwhile, Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) Publicity Secretary in the state, Kennedy Ikantu Peretei, has described the appointment as “another wrong step taken by the governor.” He said the ”appointment is like when President is also appointing Chief of Army Staff as a security adviser.” Peretei alleged that “We have said earlier that this is the government of the family and siblings. Now he has appointed his kinsman as a security adviser in order to draw illegally from the security votes of the government. POLL “The man, Adetunji Adeleye is already in the security council. Why should he now appoint him again as a special adviser on security matters? This appointment is tantamount to the President appointing Inspector General of Police(IGP) as a security adviser.”
