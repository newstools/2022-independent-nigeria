In November 2021, new commercial vehicle registrations across the European Union (EU) retreated (-14.7 per cent) for the fifth consecutive month. The van segment’s double-digit drop weighed heavily on the overall result, as vans accounted for over 80 per cent of total commercial vehicle sales in the European Union. The region’s four major markets posted strong declines last month, with the sharpest drop seen in Spain (-30.4%).

The largest markets performed well so far this year, especially Italy (+17.6 per cent) and France (+9.4 per cent), although the percentage increases in Germany (+1.3 per cent) and Spain (+0.6 per cent) fell significantly compared to earlier months. New light commercial vehicles (LCV) up to 3.5t Last month, the market for new vans in the European Union saw another double-digit decline (-16.6 per cent), as the ongoing shortage of semiconductors continued to hamper vehicle output. The region’s performance was not helped by the weak results of the major EU markets: Spain (-33 per cent), Germany (-24.7 per cent), Italy (-16.2 per cent) and France (-12.1 per cent). POLL From January to November, EU light commercial vehicle registrations were still up by 10.8 per cent at 1.4 million units, despite the weak performance of recent months. Looking at the largest markets for new vans, Italy (+17.1 per cent) and France (+9.7 per cent) managed to remain in positive territory, while cumulative volumes in Germany (+0.4 per cent) and Spain (-0.4 per cent) were more or less stable compared to 2020. New heavy commercial vehicles (HCV) of 16t and over In November, heavy truck sales in the European Union declined less steeply (-3.5 per cent) than those of vans. The Central European countries continued to provide positive support (+13.4 per cent) to the region’s performance, but this was not enough to offset the double-digit drops posted by the four major markets in Western Europe.

New medium and heavy commercial vehicles (MHCV) over 3.5t Last month, EU demand for trucks contracted by 6 per cent, counting 23,678 units sold. Similar to the heavy-truck segment, Western Europe’s performance was worse than in November 2020: Spain (-17.5 per cent), Germany (-14.1 per cent), France (-13.8 per cent) and Italy (-8.5 per cent). By contrast, most markets in Central Europe recorded gains last month. Eleven months into 2021, new truck sales in the European Union increased by 16.6 per cent year-to-date, with 264,031 units registered in total. The low base for comparison in earlier months of the year helped the region’s four largest markets to remain in positive territory so far: Italy (+22.6 per cent), Spain (+8.6 per cent), France (+6.1 per cent) and Germany (+4.8 per cent). New medium and heavy buses & coaches (MHBC) over 3.5t In November 2021, buses were the only segment showing a slight increase (+1.6 per cent) in new registrations.

From January to November, new bus and coach registrations across the EU grew by +2.3 per cent to reach 26,101 units.
