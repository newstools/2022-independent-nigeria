ABUJA – The alleged appointment of Alhaji Muhammed Abuba­kar, who retired from active service from the Federal Cap­ital Territory Administration (FCTA) Department of Eco­nomics, Planning, Revenue and Public Private Partner­ship has been condemned by a Civil Society Organisation. This was contained in a statement by the President of the Civil Service Watch for Good Governance (CSWGG), Ambassador Abila Garba which a copy was made avail­able to newsmen in Abuja. The statement reads: “For God sake he has been retired and tired by the Federal Gov­ernment why bringing him in to head a newly created and sensitive department of the FCTA that has more to do with the economic drive of the administration. RED ALERT: New Ransomware Attacking Organisational Networks… I Endorsed Tinubu For Presidency In 2019, I Have Rejected Him… “We have been keen follow­ers of the Federal Capital Ter­ritory Administration (FCTA) and its agencies. We have come to a conclusion that if the appointment of someone who for years was not in touch with new trend and ideas of governance will be allowed to assume office, it will demands for serious attention since the All Progressives Congress (APC) is believed to have come with a complete fight against corruption, favoritism and compromise that has eaten deep into the fabric of Nigeria in the past years.” The group, therefore, de­manded for prompt action by the Minister and for him to have a rethink and be in the same page with President Muhammadu Buhari “who is believed would not tolerate in­competency done by past ad­ministration no matter who.”
