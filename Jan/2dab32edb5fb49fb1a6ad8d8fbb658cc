The Human Rights Writers Association of Nigeria, HURIWA has asked the people of Plateau State to hold their governor, Simon Lalong responsible for the deteriorating security crisis in the state. Daily Post reports that in a statement on Monday, the rights group explained that the governor must be held responsible following the alleged inability of his administration to work with the State House of Assembly under the “past leadership to stamp out the earliest manifestations of armed Fulani insurgency targeting Christians”. HURIWA spoke against the backdrops of incessant attacks by suspected armed herdsmen including the mass killings of Irigwe Christians and the high-profile kidnappings of influential traditional rulers in the state. 3 Killed, 6 Injured In Suspected Drone Attack In Abu Dhabi COVID-19: Winter Olympics Tickets Won’t Be Sold To General… The rights group faulted President Muhammadu Buhari for reportedly endorsing a “peace treaty between aggressors from the Fulani ethnicity and Christians of Plateau State” stressing that “appeasement of mass killers is the reason for the widespread State of insecurity in Nigeria”. HURIWA said the government of Plateau State must put up workable security architecture to frustrate the attempts by Fulani terrorists to move their operational base from Kaduna forests to neighboring Plateau State.
