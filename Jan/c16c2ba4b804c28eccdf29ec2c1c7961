LAGOS – Pan-Yoruba Socio-cultural group, Afenifere has welcomed the declaration of interest by Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu to run for the Presidency come 2023. The group in a statement signed by Bayo Aina, the Sec­retary-general of the group saluted the foresight, personal sacrifices and doggedness of all leaders across the length and breadth of Nigeria whose courage of conviction eventu­ally birthed the APC in 2014. “We are happy that the South West zone wholly em­braced the APC, since 2015 and this has enabled the zone to participate as an equal stake­holder with other zones in the affairs of the Nation. This has now placed the zone in a pivotal position to produce the successor to President Buhari.

We must all be ready to face this reality. “We appeal to the various contestants to run the race with mutual respect, dignity, sportsmanship and genuine “Omoluabi” ethos such that Nigeria in general and the Southwest particularly will even be more united as we approach the 2023 election. We must avoid a fractricidal engagement by all means . He said that Afenifere hopes to play a role with tradi­tional rulers, religious leaders and other major stakeholders to ensure that the Southwest remains united in the match towards 2023.
