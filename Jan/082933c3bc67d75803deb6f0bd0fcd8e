Mr. President said he would reschedule the visit to the state next week and the fixed date would be communicated to us in due course,” Matawalle said. “Some of the security chiefs are currently in Katsina but can’t fly to Zamfara for the same reason. Based on this, we are extending our apology to the good people of the state for the postponement for reason beyond our control. We thank Mr. President for his love for the state. Earlier, Buhari had commissioned a three million metric tonnes cement plant of BUA in Sokoto. The President was accompanied by the Governor of Sokoto State, Rt. Hon.
