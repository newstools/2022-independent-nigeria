The woman and another neighbour, a man beat her up. “The neighbours also took the victim to the hospital and paid the bill. The woman had the girl in her first marriage before she got married to her present husband. On the day she poured hot water on the girl, the victim lost the key to their apartment, but she later found it. But the mother insisted on beating her and the girl was scared to go near the house. “It was after that incident that the mother told her to grind pepper, but the girl did not run the errand. She thought that the mother wanted to lure her in and punish her. The mother later seized the girl and poured hot water on her, causing her bodily injury,” the neighbour said.
