LAGOS – Nigerian socio-political activist and co-convener of Bring Back Our Girls Movement, Aisha Yesufu has shared her opinion on what politics is not and what she believes it should be. The popular daring activist shared her opinion on her official verified twitter handle, @AishaYesufu, today, while responding to a fellow activist’s comment on how Oyo State Governor, Seyi Makinde, accorded APC National Leader and former Governor of Lagos State, Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu much respect, during the latter’s courtesy visit today at the Government House in Oyo State. The activist, simply known as Tosin, with twitter handle @Dontee_ wrote; “Politicians will always be Politician. See the Honour Seyi gave Tinubu. That’s why nobody should die in their war…. It does not worth it, Seyi might be in APC tomorrow if it serves his interests. Its about interest and nothing more.” RED ALERT: New Ransomware Attacking Organisational Networks… I Endorsed Tinubu For Presidency In 2019, I Have Rejected Him… See tweet below; Politicians will always be Politician. See the Honour Seyi gave Tinubu. That's why nobody should die in their war…. It does not worth it, Seyi might be in APC tomorrow if it serves his interests. Its about interest and nothing more. https://t.co/b6M24i6S4f Responding, Aisha Yesufu said; “Politics is not a love affair. Emotions are not needed. It is gullible citizens that carry emotions into politics. That’s why some of them are enemies with citizens they have never seen because of voting choices in 2015. Politics is about alignment of interest and pragmatism.” See her tweet below; Politics is not a love affair. Emotions are not needed. It is gullible citizens that carry emotions into politics.
