Liverpool forward Sadio Mane was involved in a major injury scare as he helped shoot Senegal into the quarter-finals of the Africa Cup of Nations in Cameroon. Mane suffered a sickening clash of heads with Cape Verde goalkeeper Vozinha as they challenged for a long ball shortly before the hour of their round of 16 game on Tuesday. The Reds forward appeared to have been momentarily knocked unconscious before his head struck the turf heavily on landing, while Vozinha was left in obvious distress with concern immediately raised over his wellbe.

Despite clearly being affected by the collision, Mane controversially remained on the field with Senegal opting not to substitute the Liverpool man. And six minutes after the incident, Mane broke Cape Verde’s resistance with a superb 63rd-minute strike when he curled into the top corner off the underside of the crossbar after the ball fell to him at a corner. However, after a long VAR check to confirm the goal, Mane crumpled to the turf in clear pain while holding his head, with the 29-year-old eventually helped to his feet by team-mates before being assisted off the field by the national team’s medical staff. Liverpool are now awaiting an update on the player’s condition. POLL Mane’s goal was added to in injury time by Bamba Dieng to extend Senegal’s run in the competition, although whether the Liverpool man will be available for the quarter-final on Sunday remains to be seen.
