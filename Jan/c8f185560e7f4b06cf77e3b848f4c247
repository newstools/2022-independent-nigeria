Juventus will hold onto Alvaro Morata a little longer even though Barcelona are strongly chasing after him. Coach Massimiliano Allegri had a meeting with the player and told him that he wanted him to stay. The striker has practiced well after the winter break and showed no signs of malcontent, Sky Sport reports. The Bianconeri will put up resistance at least until the Supercoppa on January 12th since they have three key games in short order. They will face Napoli and Roma before colliding with Inter. Moreover, they are struggling to find a viable alternative. The management also told the Spaniard that no decision had been made yet on his future. They hold a €35M option to buy him out at the end of the season after spending €20M for the loans. Barcelona proposed to Morata a formula similar to the one used by Juventus. They guaranteed an 18-month spell and not a permanent move. The Blaugrana have not come to terms with Atletico Madrid either, further delaying the deal.

However, they do not want to commit to anybody for more than six months. Mauro Icardi is their preferred target, but he will not transfer in such fashion. In addition, he has very high wages. Regardless of what will happen with Morata and Barcelona, Juventus plan to find their new no.9 next summer. Since Dusan Vlahovic might be too expensive, Gianluca Scamacca is steadily gaining steam as a candidate, Gianluca Di Marzio reports.
