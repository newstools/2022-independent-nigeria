Watford have bolstered their squad with a new signing as they prepare to face Leicester City in the FA Cup. Claudio Ranieri’s side have announced the arrival of defender Samir from Italian side Udinese. The 27-year-old has joined the Hornets on a three-and-a-half-year deal. Cenk Tosun Makes Besiktas Transfer Admission, Outlines Everton… West Ham Extend Michail Antonio’s Contract Until 2025 Watford have not stated that the deal is subject to international clearance, meaning Samir could make his debut at the King Power Stadium on Saturday afternoon. In the sides’ last meeting, a blunder by defender William Troost-Ekong gifted Leicester one of four goals they scored on the night. City went on to win 4-2 in a snowy affair at the King Power Stadium in the Premier League. Troost-Ekong is now away with Nigeria at the Africa Cup of Nations alongside Leicester counterparts Wilfred Ndidi and Kelechi Iheanacho. Leicester will also be without defender Daniel Amartey, who is also at the tournament with Ghana. POLL City will be hoping for a defensive signing of their own this month, albeit on loan, though it seems unlikely one will arrive before the match against Watford. Jannik Vestergaard is the club’s only fit and available senior defender heading into the FA Cup tie.
