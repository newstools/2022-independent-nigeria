When you are in a political party without having access to power or government, it is like joining a pressure group or union.” “We have the Governor, what else are we looking for? The whole government’s structure in Oredo is here. The governor is from PDP; we have senators from PDP; Chief of Staff to the Governor is from PDP; Solicitor General from PDP and Commissioners from PDP. “Anybody that is not here is not ready to win, because we must continue to win. I appeal to you to go back and get more people because election is about numbers and we need the numbers to win. “Election is coming soon, including Local Government, House of Assembly, Senate and Presidential elections and together, we must win the elections,” he added.
