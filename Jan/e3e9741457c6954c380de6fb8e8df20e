According to him, “The union had a closed door meeting with the Permanent Secretary, Federal Capital Territory Administration, FCTA that lasted for several hours, while the union insisted, demanding for the promotion arrears, it was eventually paid”. After a meeting with the Permanent Secretary on the 2018 promotion arrears we expected this money before now. And now they saw the need to release it. Its all the areas of 2018. You know the teachers are in two fold. You know we have teachers from the secondary School and teachers from the primary Schools. So the payment is for the teachers in the Secondary Schools and we are still discussing with the Area Council Chairmen to see the need of paying for that of LEA teachers ” he said. It could be recalled that the union under the leadership of Comrade Stephen Knabayi has been demanding for promotion arrears of teachers.
