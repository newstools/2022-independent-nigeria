The People’s Democratic Party, PDP, Chieftain in a new year message to Nigerians said it is the Grace of God that has been sustaining us as a nation, and for us to move beyond where we are and achieve better growth we all have to be more patriotic, obey the laws of the land and remain committed to the vision of our forebearers. According to him, Nigeria has all it takes to be great in terms of human and natural resources but leadership problems and uncooperating attitude of the followers, as well as poor implementation of policies, are responsible for the poor growth and economic situation we found ourselves.
