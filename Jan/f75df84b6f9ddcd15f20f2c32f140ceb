With excitement mounting as Africa’s finest stars prepare to gather for the TotalEnergies African Cup of Nations (AFCON) Cameroon 2021, the Confederation of African Football (CAF) and the Local Organising Committee (LOC ) has unveiled the vibrant tournament poster in Cameroon on Thursday. Symbolising football’s energy and passion – and its ability to unite across all colours and creeds on the African continent – the poster also pays homage to the colourful traditions of the host nation, Cameroon.

The host country, Cameroon, is illustrated both directly and symbolically, firstly by continuing the CAF AFCON tradition of placing a star on the country’s location on the map to show the host country. Africa is a land of energy and since football is and remains a source of energy and passion, we will all come together in Cameroon to celebrate the enriching diversity of our continent. Finally, we are left with the symbolism of the ‘Toghu’, a traditional Cameroonian cloth, worn by chiefs and notables, both men and women, often made of black velvet on which are hand-embroidered patterns and decorations with thread of various colours.
