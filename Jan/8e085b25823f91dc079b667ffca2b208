LAGOS  – Barely 24 hours after the Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority (NCAA) approved bigger aircraft to land and take-off at the newly opened Anambra Airport, Air Peace has deployed its newly acquired E195-E2 and Boeing 737-700 and its equivalent aircraft to the route. The airline said it has also increased flight frequencies on specific domestic routes, including Anambra, Yola and Owerri. Mr. Stanely Olisa, the Spokesperson of the airline, in a statement said that the airline’s brand new Embraer 195-E2 and Boeing 737 aircraft, with more passenger capacity, would be deployed on the Anambra route, adding that frequency has been increased to daily flights for the same airport.

He added that flights to Yola and Ibadan would also be operated daily, while Gombe flights would now be operated five days a week. “Passengers can now connect Owerri with three daily flights from Lagos and Abuja on the brand new Embraer 195-E2. These additional frequencies will take effect from January 28, 2022”, Olisa added. Air Peace was the first airline to touch down at the new Anambra Airport on April 30, 2021, and commenced scheduled operations properly on December 7, 2021, with an initial frequency of four flights weekly. The airport had recorded 142 flights with 3,865 passengers landing and taking off after one month of its inauguration, according to the Anambra Commissioner for Works, Mr. Marcel Ifejiofor in an interview granted earlier this month.
