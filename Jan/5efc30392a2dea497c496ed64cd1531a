According to Lalong, having fought doggedly for the emancipation of his people, the late Royal Father embraced everybody within his domain irrespective of religious, ethnic and political affiliations and continued to advocate peaceful coexistence amidst the security challenges that confronted Kaduna State at various times. The Northern Governors Forum Chairman said the Royal Father was a man who believed in entrepreneurship and productivity which he did not only practice, but encouraged and mentored many youths to embrace, especially in agriculture and business. Lalong said the late Agwam Bajju also played a key role in the efforts to strengthening the traditional institution in the Northern Region and the nation at large and make it more capable of contributing to the governance of the nation. Governor Lalong Charged the family and people of Bajju Chiefdom to accept his death as the will of God and sustain his legacies of love, hardwork, honesty and patriotism.
