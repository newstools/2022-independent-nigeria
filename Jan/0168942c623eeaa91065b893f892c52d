They observed that such laws like CAMA, social me­dia bill and hate speech bill are reminiscent of the sa­tanic Decree 2 of 1984. They emphasized the need for government to re­spect civil society organi­sations as a key pillar of democracy accountable to the people, and as develop­ment actors in their own rights. They also said gov­ernments should engage with; provide support and emergency assistance to, and take action in defense of Human Rights Defend­ers (HRDs); hold effective, inclusive and transparent consultations with CSOs regarding national de­velopment priorities and guarantee meaningful CSO participation in deci­sion-making and creation of public policies; imple­ment public policies to pro­mote and strengthen CSOs. Government, the stake­holders said, should take concrete steps to reverse the trends of shrinking and closing civic spaces in development, to protect and enable space for civil society, including enabling laws and regulations, democratic accountabili­ty based on human rights norms and human rights standards, and the full protection of civil society under attack.
