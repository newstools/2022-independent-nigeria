Emefiele stated that one of the vital lessons learned from the COVID-19 outbreak was the need to make conscious measures to diversify Nigeria’s economic base. He explained that the country must do all necessary to decrease the country’s imports of products. “Proactive steps on the part of stakeholders in the private sector, in collaboration with the government in supporting the growth of sectors such as manufacturing, ICT, and infrastructure, will strengthen our ability to deal with the challenges of COVID-19, and stimulate further growth of our economy,” he said. Speaking about the importance of creating an efficient infrastructure ecosystem in Nigeria and the importance of improved infrastructure in the development of the Nigerian economy, the CBN Governor, however, revealed that all necessary approvals had been obtained for the Infrastructure Corporation to begin operations in early 2022.
