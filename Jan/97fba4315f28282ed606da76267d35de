Street to School,’ a non-governmental organisation has successfully fed 100 families in the Agbado area of Lagos on Saturday, December 25 when it held its ‘Christmas on the Street’ Initiative. The annual tradition for the organisation this year took a different turn as the humanitarians gave out cash gifts as opposed to foodstuffs like rice, oil and other sundry. ‘Street to School’ is an organisation that supports the education of out-of-school children and primary school drop-outs in Nigeria through her annual education sponsorship scheme and the establishment of tuition-free schools where children are provided with basic learning materials and enjoy free meals. The aspiration for them is to see a world where no child is left behind in attaining quality education. 7.5-Foot-Long Mushroom Canoe Merits Guinness World Record Heart Gestures Made By 265 People Makes Guinness World Records According to the visioner of ‘Street to School,’ Mrs Oluwatosin Taiwo, the Christmas on the street initiative has been on for the past nine years. “What we do is to give out foodstuff to identify needy families in rural communities. “This year, we gave out a cash gift of N5000 to each of these households because we realise that some people don’t need actual foodstuff, but need other things. This is the first time we are doing this and we targeted over 100 families. We have our strategy on identifying these families and we executed as needed.”
