Nigerian lawyer and human rights activist, Reno Omokri has aired his personal conviction about polygamy, stating that God never condemned the practice in the Bible. The former presidential aide disclosed this via his official Instagram page, stating that God only stated in Malachi 2:6 that Ge hates divorce, it wasn’t stated anywhere in the Bible that polygamy was sinful. Omokri wrote, “Well, what I am about to say is purely my personal opinion, from my understanding of Scripture. I do not speak for Christianity as a faith. Ukrainian President Downplays Talk Of Russian Invasion 10 Injured In Pittsburgh Bridge Collapse “If we go by 2 Samuel 12:8, we see that God Himself gave David multiple wives. That verse says “I gave your master’s house to you, and your master’s wives.” Also, Old Testament Prophets were polygamous. The New Testament mandates monogamy for only overseers-1 Timothy 3:2. I can not say polygamy is a sin. “However, the definition of what is sinful in the New Testament is subjective. According to the New Testament, “whatever is not from faith is sin”-Romans 14:23. “From the above, if you do anything from the conviction of your faith, flowing from your conscience, it is not sinful. However, if your conscience is against it, then it is sin for you.What God hates is divorce. We see this in Malachi 2:6. You will never see anywhere where God condemned polygamy. “Some people quote Matthew 19:5 and Genesis 2:24 “a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife, and the two will become one flesh.” Some people understand this to mean that polygamy is out of the question. “But among the Commandments that God gave the Israelites through Moses, were laws governing polygamy, for example Exodus 21:10, Deuteronomy 21:15-17. POLL “However, let me restate that these are not doctrines. These are my privately held opinions which I will never preach on an altar as the ‘thus says the Lord’. Thank you and may God bless you.”
