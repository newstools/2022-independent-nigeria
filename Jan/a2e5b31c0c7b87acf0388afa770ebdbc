Barcelona boss Xavi says France winger Ousmane Dembele must sign a new contract with the club or he will have to leave. Dembele’s deal runs out in the summer and Xavi says talks over a renewal have been taking place for five months and “we cannot wait any longer”. “Either the player renews or we look for an exit for the player – there is no other possibility,” he added.

He has been linked with a host of clubs, including Manchester United, Newcastle and now Liverpool. “He wants to stay but it has not been agreed so we have to make a decision as a club and that is either to renew or find an exit,” said Xavi, who took over as Barcelona boss in November. “It’s a shame. He has played every possible minute since I have been coach.”
