LYON have ‘categorically denied’ an agreement has been made with Newcastle United for the sale of Brazilian midfielder Bruno Guimaraes. Reports circulated this morning that a bid of around £30 million pounds from the Magpies had been accepted by French side with the 24-year-old due to undergo a medical in his homeland in Brazil, where he is currently on international duty. However, Lyon have publicly denied an agreement with the club pointing the finger at media for pedalling misinformation. Newcastle United Discouraged From Striker Bid Chelsea Could Recall Italy International Emerson From Lyon The club said: “Olympique Lyonnais categorically denies the false information disseminated by many media reporting an agreement between Newcastle and OL for the transfer of Brazilian international midfielder Bruno Guimaraes. “In this transfer window period where the slightest rumor is often presented as reality, Olympique Lyonnais reminds that only information officially released by the club is to be taken into consideration.” The club has a history of denying deals for players only for them to go through at a later stage. The French side were quick to deny Ferland Mendy’s move to Real Madrid in 2019. Newcastle are reported to be attempting to push through a deal before the window closes in four days time. They have switched their attentions to midfielder Guimaraes after walking away from negotiations for Manchester United’s Jesse Lingard.
