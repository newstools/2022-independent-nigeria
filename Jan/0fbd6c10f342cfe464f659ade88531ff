Ajax goalkeeper Andre Onana is reportedly a step away from completing his long-awaited move to Inter. Per Sky Sport Italia (via SempreInter), the Cameroon international is set to arrive in Milan to put pen to paper on a long-term contract before finalizing his switch in the summer. Onana has been on Inter’s radar for quite some time now, with the Nerazzurri identifying the 25-year-old as a long-term replacement for the long-serving stalwart Samir Handanovic. The veteran shot-stopper could be offered a new deal in the coming weeks, but only to play second fiddle to Onana come the 2022/23 season. Handanovic’s current contract at the Stadio Giuseppe Meazza runs out at the end of the season, with Inter considering offering him a one-year extension. The Slovenian committing to a new deal should not affect the club’s pursuit of the Ajax star that could be finalized in the coming weeks. Antonio, Lanzini Score As West Ham Triumph Southampton Midfielder Retires At 26 Onana is well into the final year of his deal in Amsterdam and has already told the Lancers he has no intention of extending his stay in the Eredivisie. He reportedly has an agreement with Inter in principal to join the club in the summer. The Cameroonian should arrive in Milan by the end of January to sign the papers. Given his contractual situation at Ajax, it comes as no surprise that he has not made a single Eredivisie appearance this season. Since Erik ten Hag is unlikely to bring his wantaway goalkeeper back into his starting line-up by the end of the season, Inter may have to be patient with Onana once the deal becomes official. The highly-rated keeper may need a bit of time to regain form. Therefore, Inter’s hopes of extending Handanovic’s contract make sense.
