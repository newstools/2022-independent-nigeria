While noting that it is not a negative thing for the party members to express their opinion, he said that it is a sign that they are passionate about the party winning the 2022 governorship election in the state. Meanwhile, some aggrieved PDP members from Ekiti State have staged a peaceful protest outside the party’s national secretariat. The protesters, who carried placards with different inscriptions, expressed their displeasure over what they described as an attempt by Fayose to impose his candidate on the people.
