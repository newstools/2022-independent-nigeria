AKURE – Politicians in Ekiti State have been called upon to embrace peace in all their dealings before, during and after the forthcoming gubernatorial election in the state. Dr Olusegun Aderemi, the Nigeria Regional President, Occupational Safety and Health Association (OSHA), UK, made the appeal on Tuesday on the heel of the festering crisis among some politicians in the state over the weekend. He noted that the love of the people and the state should be paramount to anyone who’s aspiring to occupy any public office in the state.

He, therefore, appealed to politicians to see one another first as brothers and sisters from the same root, saying they all had no elsewhere to run to if the state is destroyed. Dr Aderemi stated that Ekiti is known for excellence in academics and intellectual prowess, adding that many people look up to the state for encouragement. He appreciated all the leaders both in the political circle and non-politicians for their contributions to the development of the state since it was created in 1996. The Aramoko-born international businessman and Safety/Security expert, therefore, appealed to elder statesmen in the state to intervene timely in the festering crisis among politicians in the state before it escalated.
