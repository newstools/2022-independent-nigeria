Abdullahi said that the Centre had in 2021 trained over 700 young people who were selected from various rural communities in the state, adding that he was very happy that the Centre has co-opted young Almajiris into the system. “We have been collaborating with Engausa like the founder said. “As a result of intervention, we have done for the Centre last year; they had multiplied the number of people they trained. In 2021, as they trained more than 700 people in this Centre as a result of this collaboration,” he said. He added that the Agency has been expanding its collaboration, adding that more efforts would be deployed this year to help the less privileged children to have access to digital technology. POLL “One of our mandates is to implement the policy under the National Digital Economy Policy for digital Nigeria to logical conclusion in achieving the 95 per cent digital literacy by 2030. “You know government cannot do it alone, we need to partner with Centres like Engausa to achieve this. “So, we are working with them to even expand this Centre beyond Kano to other States and also to see how we can equip them more,” DG added. Explaining further, he said: “we are also looking at how we can assist the children who have participated in this programme to start their own businesses.” Earlier, the founder of the Centre, Mr Mustapha Ringim, said the Centre was out to bridge the gap among the young people, especially those who cannot make it in formal school.

Ringim said he had realised that Language should not be a barrier to achieving one’s dream, especially when it comes to global technology. He argued that there are lot of developments in countries which are not using English Language as medium of learning skills, like European countries where English is not well spoken but still technology, innovation and creativity is flourishing in those countries. “So, I realised that English Language is not the only medium of learning, it is not the only medium of productivity when it comes to knowledge and when it comes to practising what you know. “That is why I break the language barrier of English and domesticated the technology and the skills I have in me so that the people will easily tap from my knowledge through the use of Hausa language for better understanding of the subject matter, “ he explained
