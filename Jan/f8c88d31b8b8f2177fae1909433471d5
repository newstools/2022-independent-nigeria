I’ll come around when the ban is lifted to speak to you one-on-one in your various enclaves. However, my Speaker and other well-spirited Nigerians are moving around the country and are talking to people of importance, especially critical stakeholders like you. “I want to promise you that I will not disappoint any of you, looking at the relationship I have with the Speaker of the Kogi State House of Assembly, I know that by the grace of God, we will have a more robust and wonderful relationship. We will get to the Presidential Villa on May 29th, 2023. “I need your support, I need your prayers, I need your buy-in, I need you very much so that together, we can save this country and build on the successes of President Muhammadu Buhari. I once again promise that I will not betray your trust, I will not disappoint you because I am a man who keeps promises and trust.”
