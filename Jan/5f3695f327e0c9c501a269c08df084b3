She said the viewing centres are located at Teslim Balogun Stadium in Surulere; Campos Mini Stadium, Lagos Island; Naval Yard, Ajegunle; and Abesan playground. Others, according to the statement, are Bishop Aggrey Youth Centre, Mushin; Epe Recreation Centre, Italewa Ikorodu; Badagry Grammar School, Badagry; Agege Stadium, Agege; and Mobolaji Johnson Sports Center, Rowe Park, Yaba. “When Nigeria took on Egypt in their first Group match on Tuesday, all the centres were filled with Nigerians coming out in their numbers to show their patriotic support for their darling Eagles, who eventually won with 1-0,” it said. “The idea of the private sectors partnering with State Government is to bring football closer to Lagos residents which will be more fun and entertaining as fans watch all the matches of the Africa Cup of Nations 2021 (AFCON). POLL “As part of this administration’s theme, the viewing centres will serve as an avenue to bring people together for a better world and this is what LSSC is doing with the AFCON Viewing Centres.”
