ENUGU – There was tension in Enugu as gunmen en­forcing sit-at-home at­tacked Enugu South Local Government Area of­fice of the All Progressives Congress (APC) during their meeting and shot dead the state youth leader of the par­ty, Mr. Kelvin Ezeoha, and one other member. This is coming as the sit-at-home order entered the third day in Enugu, paralysing ac­tivities in the state. The order which com­menced on Monday despite the cancelation by IPOB has kept residents of the state at home. Expert Says FCTA Can Revamp Revenue, Reduce Cost Of Governance FCT-IRS Launches Aggressive Tax Drive To Meet N200bn Target It was gathered that mem­bers of the party from Ward III, Obeagu Awkunanaw, Enugu South Local Govern­ment Area, were having a reconciliation meeting at the party office located in their ward when the armed gun­men numbering over seven stormed the venue killing the two party members instantly while whisking away one oth­er person. A chieftain of the party, who spoke to Daily Indepen­dent on condition of ano­nymity, said, “Some gunmen invaded Enugu South LGA APC meeting this evening while their meeting was in progress, opened fire on the party members.” He said, “They killed the immediate past Enugu South Local Government Area chairman of the party, now the incumbent state youth leader, Mr. Kelvin Ezeoha, and one other person, while a par­ty member was kidnapped. It was not yet clear if the killing was a case of political assassination or handiwork of suspected members of the proscribed Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB). Meanwhile, the streets of Enugu metropolis continued to remain deserted as banks, shops, markets, offices and schools remain closed. POLL A resident of Obiagu in Enugu metropolis, Godwin Egbo, described the sit-at-home as an act of wickedness. Efforts to speak with the state Police Public Relations Officer, ASP Daniel Ndukwe, proved abortive as he did not reply messages sent to him through his phone.
