Fabio Cannavaro is close to becoming the new manager of the Poland national team after Paulo Sousa left for Flamengo after less than a year in charge. Former Fiorentina coach Sousa walked away at the end of December in order to take the job at Brazilian club Flamengo instead, having overseen just 15 games with six wins, five draws and four defeats. According to Sky Sport Italia transfer expert Gianluca Di Marzio, the new favourite to lead Poland is Cannavaro. ‘Mourinho One Of The Best Managers In The World’ –… Newcastle Suffer Huge Injury Blow With Wilson Out For Eight… The former Napoli and Italy defender had a meeting with Polish officials today and the negotiations are progressing well in Krakow. He should be soon ready to sign a two-year contract, although he’d be thrown straight in at the deep end to prepare March’s World Cup play-off against Russia. Ballon d’Or and World Cup winner Cannavaro retired as a player in 2012 and took up a management career at Al-Ahli, Guangzhou Evergrande, Al-Nassr, Tianjin Quanjian and the China national team for just two games in March and April 2019. Other alternatives for the Poland bench include former Juventus coach Andrea Pirlo.
