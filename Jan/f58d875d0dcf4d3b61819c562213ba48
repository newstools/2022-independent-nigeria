Two police officers have been shot dead on a rural road in western Germany while on a routine patrol. The shooting happened during a traffic check near Kusel at about 4.20am local time, police in Kaiserslautern said. The officers – a 24-year-old woman and 29-year-old man – were able to radio that shots were being fired, spokesman Bernhard Christian Erfort told n-tv television.

The perpetrators fled but police had no description of them, the car they used or what direction they fled in. A manhunt was extended to the neighbouring German state of Saarland, police said.
