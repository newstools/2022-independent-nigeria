Enugu DisCO Begins Aggressive Revenue Drive Nigeria, Egypt In Talk Over Improved Power “The growing adoption of EVs will replace fossil fuels in vehicles, while electric cooking and heating offer significant efficiency gains but introduce yet greater demand for electrical power. At the same time, the increasingly persuasive economic case for small-scale renewables will see rooftop solar deployments become common, leading to buildings becoming more complex consumers and producers of electricity. “The term’ prosumers’ is often used to describe the way building owners will manage this new relationship with power, so expect to see and hear more reference to prosumers in the year ahead. How buildings interact with energy infrastructure has long been a vital consideration, but as they are developed and redeveloped in response to changing needs in the coming years, that consideration will rise higher up the agenda. “We can expect the basic processes of the industry, such as tenders for contracts and construction standards, to become increasingly focused on questions of power management” It also said digitalization will become an essential enabler in the New Year.
