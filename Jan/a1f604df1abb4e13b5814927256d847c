Steven Gerrard is back in the dugout this afternoon but he’s without top-scorer Ollie Watkins. Watkins misses the squad for the first time since August, while Danny Ings is the man who leads the line this afternoon. There’s changes aplenty for Villa with Bertrand Traore starting ahead of his international involvement with Burkina Faso. Man Utd Make Decision On Edinson Cavani’s Future Confirmed Everton Team Vs Brighton Kortney Hause replaces Tyrone Mings with the latter serving a one-match suspension. Mings, 28, picked up his fifth yellow card of the campaign on Boxing Day while Hause comes in for his first appearance for Villa since their horror 4-1 loss to West Ham on Halloween. John McGinn is back today after missing the Chelsea defeat and the Scot captains Villa in Mings’ absence. It’s a reshuffle in midfield then with McGinn alongside Douglas Luiz and Jacob Ramsey. It means Traore joins Emi Buendia as Villa’s two No.10s off Ings. POLL From front to back and Emi Martinez is in goal with Matty Cash, ex-Bees ace Ezri Konsa, Hause and Matt Targett all in defence. It’s a midfield trio of McGinn, Douglas Luiz and Ramsey with Buendia and Traore in support of central striker Ings. Away from the starting line-up, 16-year-old centre-back Josh Feeney steps up to the first-team squad for the first time in place of Napoli-bound Axel Tuanzebe. Influential figure Ashley Young is also missing due to a fractured toe, with Villa’s bench featuring the likes of Bertrand Traore, Trezeguet and Anwar El Ghazi. Here’s how Villa line up. Confirmed Lineups: Getafe Vs Real Madrid PSG’s Messi, Three Others Test Positive For COVID-19 Aston Villa, 4-3-2-1: Martinez; Cash, Konsa, Hause, Targett; McGinn (c), Douglas Luiz, J.Ramsey; Buendia, Traore; Ings.
