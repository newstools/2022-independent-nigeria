LAGOS – Chief Sunday Okoro, a governorship aspirant for Abia State in 2023, has said if elected as the state chief executive, he would make sure that each of the 17 local government areas of the state would have one standard general hospital. Chief Okoro, who holds the title of Anaemenyuoku 1 of Ohafia in Abia State, spoke through a press release on his plans for the state, saying he would dwell more on developing Abia’s infrastructure, which is obviously moribund while ensuring that the unpaid salaries of the state’s workers were cleared.The California, United States-based politician and a member of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) noted that Abia is currently run badly, promising that if eventually elected, he had a lot of works to do, saying Abia State needed a renaissance.“I will concentrate on infrastructure because Abia State is almost dead infrastructure-wise.“Look at our healthcare system and you will understand what I am talking about. There is virtually no standard hospital in the state.“This has also challenged me; I will make sure that each of the 17 LGAs has at least one standard general hospital. Our people need to have access to good healthcare “Also, our pensioners are dying over non-payment and our workers are also not paid. This is another priority area for me if I find myself at the Government House; I have plans for the people,” he said.
