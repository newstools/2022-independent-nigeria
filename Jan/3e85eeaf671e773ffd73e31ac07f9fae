The National Agency for Science Engineering Infrastructure (NASENI) has called on students to leverage on creativity and innovation in bridging technological gaps in the country. Prof. Mohammed Haruna, the Executive Director of NASENI, made the call during a book launch titled: “Design Principles for Modern rotating Electromechanical Machines” in Abuja. Haruna, who was represented by the Acting Director, Technology Business Development, Mr Ozigi Bernard, said there was need for the Nigerian economy to be technologically driven.

Haruna specifically said: “the book is a major contribution to science, technology and innovation in the country.” Dr Olorotimi Awodiji, Senior Lecturer, Department of Electrical Engineering, University of Jos, the Book Reviewer, said the book explained how to fill existing gaps in electrical designing. ”Most of our designs come from abroad due to lack of human resources, the textbooks, machines and equipment that are necessary. The book addresses the fundamentals and mainly the deficiencies in the designing of electrical machines if the book is properly studied,” Awodiji said. POLL He also advised students to embrace Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) courses, saying the country needs more engineers and scientists. Awodiji appealed to government to give more incentives in terms of scholarships to students to encourage them to study STEM courses that could fill manpower deficit in the country.
