ABUJA – As pressure mounts on the All Progressives Congress APC Caretaker Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee (CECPC) to come out with specific timelines for the proposed February national convention of the party, a crucial meeting of the APC Governors is ongoing to respond to the call by party stakeholders. No fewer than eighteen of the Governors are currently locked inside the Kebbi State Governor’s Lodge in what stakeholders say is a make of break decision to save the party from imminent collapse. The Mai Mala Buni led Caretaker Extraordinary Convention Planning Committee CECPC has been accused of several failings including an alleged plot to succeed itself, an allegation the Committee has vehemently denied.Among Governors sighted on arrival include Governor Buni, the Yobe State governor, Hope Uzodinma of Imo State, among others.
