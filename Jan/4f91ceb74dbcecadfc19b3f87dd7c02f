The Deputy Governor of Lagos State, Obafemi Hamzat, has revealed that the major reason why Nigeria is broken is due to lack of personal responsibility, not because of bad leadership. Hamzat disclosed this at the commissioning of the Ultra-Modern Quranic Central Mosque and Turbaning of Admiral Jubrila Ayinla and his wife, Alhaja Jemilah Ayinla, as the New Baba Adinni and Amira Tul-Mehmeen of Quranic Muslim Community. He urged citizens to take personal responsibility seriously, as contributing back to the society would have the country get better.

Well, l want to say that, it is not 100% correct in my view. The problem is that the family has broken up and there is a lack of personal responsibility in the country. “Many people have left their responsibilities undone which is having negative effects on the society and country at large.”
