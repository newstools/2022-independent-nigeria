UGHELLI – A chieftain of the Peoples’ Democratic Party (PDP) in Ughelli South Local Government Area of Delta State, Chief Vincent Sito, has frowned at a prophesy credited to the leader of INRI Evangelical Spiritual Church, Primate Elijah Ayodele who predicted that former Commissioner for Works, Chief James Augoye, will win the 2023 Governorship election in Delta State. Primate Ayodele had named three persons who are likely to become the next governor of the State, and they included former Commissioner for Works, Chief James Augoye, Deputy Governor of Delta State, Barr. Kingsley Otuaro, and Senator James Manager as possible candidates to succeed Governor Ifeanyi Okowa. The clergyman explained further that among them, Chief James Augoye is the best person to emerge as the next governor, while advising the current governor of Delta State to consult God so as to put Delta State in safe hands. In reaction to the prophesy on Tuesday in Warri, Sito described it as fake and politically motivated to give undue credence to those he mentioned. He noted that its only God that gives power and not through politically motivated prophesies aimed at deceiving the people of Delta State. According to him, “l wonder, the interest of Ayodele in Delta state that God will reveal to him who will be the next Governor of Delta when God has not reveal to him who will be the next Governor of his own state. “The next Governor of Delta State will be determined through the polls and Grace of the Almighty God. So I called on Deltans to disregard the prophesy as it was sponsored by those who want to benefit from it”, he added.
