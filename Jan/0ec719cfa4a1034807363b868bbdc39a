According to the filmmaker, she chose to remember her with thanksgiving because nothing takes God by surprise. She wrote; “It’s been one year since my mother in love passed. Who would have thought that one of the strongest women I know would pass on so soon? In all things we give thanks. I remember being so stressed out with worry heading to Nigeria to represent my husband at his mom’s funeral because he couldn’t attend all the while uneasy about leaving him knowing he wasn’t in a great place. God saw us through it all and we are thankful.

He allowed it for a reason. You will always live on in our hearts Mrs. Oboli and we love you forever.” Also remembering his late mother, Omoni’s husband, Nnamdi Oboli described the anniversary of her demise as a reminder of a broken chord. “It’s been a year since my mum passed away. Some pains cannot be expressed adequately to explain the loss we feel…I feel…in word. All I can say today, in the words of Job 1:21, is ‘The LORD gave and the LORD has taken away. Blessed be the name of the LORD’. You will always be sorely missed, and January 11th will never be the same again; a reminder of a broken chord,” he wrote.
