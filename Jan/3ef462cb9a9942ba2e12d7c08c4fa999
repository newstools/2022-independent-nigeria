In her address, the Executive Secretary of PTAD, Dr Chioma Ejikeme, said that the Am Alive application was a giant step meant to reduce the stress of pensioners going forward; while confirming whether an individual pensioner is alive or not. “With the Am Alive application, you can do your verification in the comfort of your home and it will hit the PTAD database simultaneously; thus, a stress-free, seamless, concise and friendly technological app all pensioners can relate to. “Today’s launch of the application is a test run to determine its workability; while the pensioners here today would act as those that will train their fellow colleagues. “In every community you must find or have people using simple android phones that you can use to enter our website and fill up the simple requirements and get your confirmation at the end,” Ejikeme said. The executive secretary also revealed that the Federal Government had set-up a committee to liaise with the Federal Ministry of Health to see to the possibility of placing all senior citizens in a universal health insurance coverage scheme. “This arrangement when implemented will ensure optimal health of all our senior citizens and all pensioners will be included and be beneficiaries of the scheme,” she said.
