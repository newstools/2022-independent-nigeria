AKURE – Nigeria Labour Congress(NLC) on Wednesday declared that the lasting solution to the crisis associated with petrol subsidy removal could only be resolved through the construction of new refineries in the country. Comrade Akpausoh Akpausoh, National General Secretary, Radio, Television and Theatre Arts Workers Union (RATTAWU) stated this on Wednesday while addressing newsmen in Akure, Ondo State capital, on why the planned nationwide rally against the proposed increase in pump price was suspended. Comrade Akpausoh, who represented NLC President, Comrade Ayuba Wabba in Ondo State and coordinate the suspended protest, said the several attempts to resuscitate the existing refineries had failed with over $10bilion going down the drain. APC Welcomes Suspension Of Petrol Subsidy Removal Ethical Re-Orientation, Panacea For National Development –… He, therefore, declared that the only way out of the fuel subsidiary crisis was for the Federal Government to establish another set of refineries so that the importation of finished products of crude oil would come to an end. Comrade Akpausoh noted that the Federal Government’s attempt to hike pump price was illegal because it ran afoul of the November 20, 2020 agreement reached by the Federal Government and the labour union on fuel subsidy. He said a technical committee was constituted to meet and deliberate on the matter. It was agreed that no action could be taken on fuel subsidy removal without the input of the labour in the decision-making. Akpausoh, therefore, advised that the Federal Government should inject the proposed fund(N5000) it planned to pay the citizenry monthly into construction of new refineries.
