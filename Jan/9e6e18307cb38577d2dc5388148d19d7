For years, Akinwunmi Adesina, the President of African Development Bank Group has maintained a peculiar outlook. Fresh, cool, calm and collected almost describes the man whenever he steps out. Indeed, hardly does he step out looking ruffled despite the fact that he seems to have a restricted sense of fashion. Not even when his second term bid as president of the bank was in near jeopardy did he appear out of place.

The programme aimed at concentrating agro-processing activities in the state had in attendance notable individuals such as the Kaduna State Governor, Nasir el- Rufai; Ogun State Governor, Dapo Abiodun; and his Oyo State counterpart, Seyi Makinde. Also in attendance at the event were Prof. Doyin Salami, the Chief Economic Adviser (CEA) to President Muhammadu Buhari; Uche Orji, Managing Director of the Nigeria Sovereign Investment Authority (NSIA) and Farouk Mohammed Gumel, NSIA Chairman. At the event, Adeshina who was garbed in a navy blue suit was spotted all smiles as he engaged top personalities on the future of the project.
