LAGOS – The Director of Admissions at the Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board (JAMB), Mr Mohammed Babaji Ahmed has decried the slow pace of admission processing in tertiary institutions for the 2021 admissions exercise.Thus, the Board has called on tertiary institutions across the country to expedite action on the completion of the 2021 Admission exercise. The Director of Admissions, Mr. Ahmed appealed while briefing some selected institutional Desk Officers, and implored them to interact with their respective institutions to ensure that even if they are not ready for the students to resume.He advised them to conduct such admissions before their respective chosen resumption dates to enable their candidates to know their fate. Besides acknowledging the numerous challenges that have impacted the academic calendars of tertiary institutions, the Director urged them to close the gap whereby only about one hundred thousand candidates have been processed out of the over six hundred thousand eligible candidates and urged affected institutions to close the gap. Remembrance: Military Men Make Unquantifiable Sacrifices,… School Resumption: Oyo Govt Not Impressed With Low Turnout Ahmed explained that the call became necessary following the negligible number of fully-processed 2021 Admissions on the Central Admissions Processing System (CAPS) out of the teeming population of eligible candidates with the requisite qualifications yearning for admission. He urged them to devise acceptable means of closing the gap and complete the 2021 Admission exercise on schedule.Ahmed disclosed that the Board was on the verge of rolling out the 2022 UTME application documents hence the need for Desk Officers to be proactive. He expressed the resolve of the Board to prevent candidates from incurring unnecessary expenses through buying new e-pins that they may not use if they are eventually admitted. Recall that over 1.4m candidates registered for both the 2021 Unified Tertiary Matriculation Examination(UTME) and Direct Entry(DE) out of which only about 600,000 possessed the requisite qualifications to be admitted based on available records with the Board.
