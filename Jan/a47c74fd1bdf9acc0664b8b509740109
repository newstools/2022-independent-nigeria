Everton had been due to play Leicester City in the Premier League on Tuesday, but that game has now been postponed. The Foxes had petitioned the Premier League Board that they did not have the required number of players — 13 outfield players and one goalkeeper — to fulfill the tie, and saw their application approved much like Everton had also done recently. For Leicester City, it was a combination of COVID-19 cases, injuries and players away on international duty at the Africa Cup of Nations that has led to this situation. The game had originally been scheduled for December 19th, but had been pushed back to January 11th after the Foxes had asked for a similar dispensation.

The Premier League leaves a lot more leeway with their ‘13 plus 1’ rule to seek a postponement while the FA Cup rules are stricter in insisting a club play with what they have including youth teams. Per the Premier League website on their guidelines – The Board assesses applications to postpone matches on a case-by-case basis, based on existing rules and adapted COVID-19 postponement guidance, implemented in light of the new Omicron variant. The Board will assess a number of factors, including the ability of a club to field a team; the status, severity and potential impact of the COVID-19 outbreak at the club; and the ability of the players to safely prepare for and play the match. The Board must also consider the wider risks to the opposition and other people the club representatives may come into contact with.
