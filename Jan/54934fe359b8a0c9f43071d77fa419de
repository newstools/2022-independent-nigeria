Following the call to release the Indigenous People of Biafra, IPOB’s leader Nnamdi Kanu, the Attorney-General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami (SAN) has said President Muhammadu Buhari will consider the interest of Nigerians. Malami who featured on NTA’s Good Morning Nigeria Show said, “By way of general statements to the two issues presented, the issue relating to Kanu and by extension, IPOB, what I can tell you for certain is that the decision of the President is based fundamentally and at all times on public interest consideration. “In the art of governance and what I have come to learn about the mind and heart of the President, Muhammadu Buhari, is to consider the 200 million as against the limited people.

The elders, led by former Minister of Aviation in the First Republic, Chief Mbazulike Amaechi, had made the call during a meeting with Buhari at the State House, Abuja. The Amaechi-led elders had urged the president to grant the IPOB leader an unconditional release.
