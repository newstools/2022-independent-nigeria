Zimbabwean actress, Vimbai Mutinhiri, who is married to a Nigerian, Andrew Ekpenyong, has recounted her experience with COVID-19 amidst breastfeeding her daughter who just turned six months. In an Instagram post which captured her moments in the hospital with her newborn, the former Big Brother Africa contestant described the first six months of her daughter’s life as a roller coaster of sorts. “God sent His ray of sunshine to transform my life forever! These first six months have been a roller coaster to say the least. I have laughed, cried, panicked, GOOGLED, read, read and read some more.

Of course, Mommy needs to be in good physical and mental health, but I have enjoyed giving my daughter the space she needs to lead the way and wow have I watched her flourish into a strong-willed, fierce and highly independent little lady,” she wrote. She further thanked God for the grace to breastfeed when she saw how quickly her immune system fought off COVID. “Exclusive breastfeeding has become a controversial choice, but it’s something I wouldn’t trade for anything. Those sleepless nights were all worth it, and even though I thought I’d drop it quickly at this milestone – I’m excited to continue breastfeeding for as long as is feasible. Happy Half Birthday to my shining star, Princess Atumwa Eme. Mommy loves you so much my girl,” she added.
