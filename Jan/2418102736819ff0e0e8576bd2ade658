The arms included rocket launchers, machine guns and sniper rifles, which had been seized by the US Navy in recent months.

The militia’s deputy information minister denied Iran was smuggling weapons into Yemen, according to the Journal, and Tehran said the weapons were not sold or transported to the country.
