The Argentina international has agreed a deal through to 2027 in what is a huge boost for the club. Martinez has established himself as one of the best keepers in the Premier League since joining from Arsenal for £20million in September 2020. “When I signed for Villa I was massively ambitious,” he said. “The club opened the door for me and made me a better keeper. They are good people, ambitious as well with the owners. “I think I can improve more here and wanted to commit my future here. It feels like home. “I won a major tournament with Argentina not long ago. Every time I walk through the tunnel on a matchday I see the European Cup and the FA Cup. “That is where I want to get to. I want to be in a Champions League final for Villa. I want to be at Wembley playing in finals. That is why I am committing five-and-a-half years to this club. Martinez, who has kept 20 clean sheets in 58 appearances for the club, added: “I started a little bit late (as a goalkeeper) and I am not even in my prime yet. Villa opened the door for me when I was at Arsenal and wanted to leave. “I am grateful to this club and want to win major trophies here. My family is happy here and that is massively important. I am looking forward to another five-and-a-half years.”
