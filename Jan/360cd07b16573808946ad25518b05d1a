Australia has cancelled the visa of Czech tennis player Renata Voracova, who had entered the country to play in the Australian Open. She is being held in the same hotel as Serbian star Novak Djokovic, who is appealing the cancellation of his visa. Djokovic’s initial exmeption from vaccine requirements for unspecified reasons angered many Australians. But the Czech government said Voracova entered Australia on a valid exemption, because of a recent Covid-19 infection. It says she will now withdraw from the tournament and leave Australia. The Australian government said on Friday that a recent infection does not mean a foreign national can travel to the country without being fully vaccinated. More than 90% of Australia’s adult population has had at least two doses of the coronavirus vaccine, but many still face restrictions as Covid case numbers rise. The initial decision to issue a visa to Djokovic caused anger amongst many Australians, who said that sports stars should be treated the same as everybody else. The Serbian star is known for his opposition to vaccines. POLL The Australian Open begins on 17 January in Melbourne.
