The NWC will continue to update stakeholders of any development in this regard.” It will be recalled that Lagos PDP state Congress which was to be concluded last year was aborted over disagreement on the delegates lists and violence by some members of the party. It is expected that with the rise in the fortune of the party occasioned by the entry into the party a few days ago of over 40,000 members of the Lagos4Lagos movement led by its visioner, Olajide Adeniran, popularly called Jandor, it is hopeful that the stakeholders will use the opportunity to manage its affairs properly, conduct a successful Congress that will produce members of the state executive committee, who will manage the affairs of the party ahead of the 2023 general elections.
