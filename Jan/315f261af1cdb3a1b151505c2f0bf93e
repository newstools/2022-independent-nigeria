Mr Federal Otokito, the abducted Bayelsa Commissioner for Industry, Trade and Investment, is still held hostage in the kidnappers’ den about five days after the incident. He has whisked away at gunpoint by his assailants on Thursday from his residence at Otuokpoti community in the Ogbia Local Government Area of the state. The bandits sped away with him in a speedboat they had kept steaming at the waterside on Thursday night. The gunmen are suspected to be illegal crude oil refinery operators and they were said to have abducted Otokito because he vowed to abort their plan to set up a Spotfire camp around the community’s bush. There were reports at the weekend that Otokito’s kidnappers had contacted the paramount ruler of his community and told him that the victim was in their custody. The leader of the gang, according to sources, did not demand ransom to free Otokito but rather gave a condition that his detained father be released by the police in order for them to also release the commissioner. It was also learnt that the hoodlums had not contacted Otokito’s family since the incident happened. The State Police Command had said it had launched a manhunt for the rescue of the victim and the arrest of the suspects.
