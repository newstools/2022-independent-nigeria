The actor, who has been confined to his hometown, had in a viral video begged Nigerians to assist him as he could not afford an artificial leg that he estimated at about N600,000. According to reports, the attention of the billionaire prophet was drawn to the video and thereafter he sent a delegation to Duru’s home in Anambra to present a cash gift of N5 million to him with the aim of alleviating his pains.
