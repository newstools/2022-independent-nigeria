ABUJA – The Office of the National Security Adviser (ONSA) has said the Director General (DG), National Intelligence Agency, (NIA), Ambassador Ahmed Ru­fa’i Abubakar has “never failed promotion examination.” ONSA noted that contrary to these false claims, Ambas­sador Abubakar has “consis­tently been an outstanding officer.” It also disclosed that, the appointment and tenure of NIA DG is an “exclusive pre­rogative” of the President and Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces.
