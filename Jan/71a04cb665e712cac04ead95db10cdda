The pain of his passing will be felt in the void of wisdom and the active manner Kabiyesi held the cultural and socioeconomic development of Ibadanland at heart. His wealth of experience, his immense wisdom, and his commitment to seeing a greater Ibadan and a better Oyo State are unrivalled in tenacity. Ibadan, Oyo State, Nigeria and humanity at large will miss Kabiyesi – he was ever ready to give his all to see a better society. “As I urge us to honour him by celebrating his enduring and exemplary legacies, I pray the God almighty will grant his soul Aljanna Firdaus, and console his immediate family together with all sons and daughters of Ibadanland” Kolapo Kola-Daisi statement read.
