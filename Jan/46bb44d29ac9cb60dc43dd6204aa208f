The Pioneer Secretary of Ebonyi State chapter of All Progressives Congress (APC), Chief Chaka Nweze, has said that the declaration of interest for the 2023 pres­idency by Governor David Umahi as a welcome devel­opment as the clamour for Ndigbo to produce the suc­cessor of President Muham­madu Buhari intensifies. He said the declaration was a show of courage and determination to repeat the developmental feats he recorded in Ebonyi State at the national level to take Nigeria to greater heights. The APC chieftain, a for­mer chairman of Ohaozara Local Government Area of Ebonyi State, said Umahi was eminently qualified and best suited for the pres­idential seat come 2023, stressing that he belonged to the class of leaders who practiced politics devoid of bitterness, hostility and ac­rimony.

It is a demon­stration of courage, capaci­ty and readiness to replicate in Nigeria the developmen­tal success recorded in Ebo­nyi State under his admin­istration,” the APC stalwart said. According to Nweze, Umahi, even as a member of Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) before joining APC in November 2020, had always shown tremendous respect for President Muhammadu Buhari and maintained a cordial relationship with him. He stated that when the governor joined APC, the fortunes of the party in the Southeast changed for good, especially in Ebonyi State, where he united the party members and reconciled warring factions, which paved way for the success­ful conduct of ward, local government and state con­gresses. The ex-Ebonyi APC scribe averred that in the last six years and eight months, Umahi had amaz­ingly transformed Ebonyi State, with the execution of massive infrastructure projects and human em­powerment programmes to cater for the needs of the people to the point that the state had become a model in leadership and good gov­ernance.
