Tesla Cybertruck customers who were hoping to be driving their futuristic pick up along the highway this year may now have to wait until at least 2023. The latest of several delays has been caused by engineers tweaking the design of the Cybertruck. Initial production is now targeted for the first quarter of next year, a source told Reuters on Thursday. The claim is backed up by Tesla’s recent alteration of text on Cybertruck’s product page in which it removed the year from the message. The phrase “You will be able to complete your configuration as production nears in 2022” now reads, “You will be able to complete your configuration as production nears.” Facebook Faces $3.2bn UK Class Action Lawsuit For Exploiting… Verification Exercise: Pensioners Applaud Buhari Over… Tesla had been expected to begin full-scale production of the all-electric Cybertruck by the end of 2021, but in August the date slipped to early 2022. Tesla has yet to reveal the reason — or reasons — for the delays, though Reuters’ source points at design changes to the vehicle. It’s also possible that the global chip shortage may have impacted production — something Tesla CEO Elon Musk alluded to in a tweet in November — while issues at the Texas plant tasked with building the Cybertruck could also be a factor. All eyes are now on Tesla’s earnings call on January 26, where Musk is expected to offer an updated product road map for the automaker.
