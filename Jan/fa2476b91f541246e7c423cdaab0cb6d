Denies Her Sermons On Hellfire, Says Videos Edited She said, “I’ve been receiving some strange calls saying ‘Evangelist Funmilayo you are affecting us. Many of our members hear your message and they pull out of our church. If you don’t stop, we will kill you’. “I thought it was just a threat until at times we will be driving, we will see people bringing out guns through their cars, shooting at us, pursuing us, coming to the church compound with guns, things like that. “At times, I will be in the bank and they will take my picture and forward it to me, and say ‘See, you are in the bank, if we want to kill you, we would have killed you. We are just warning you, stop and if you don’t stop, we are still going to disgrace you. “When they discovered, I didn’t change. They decided to make use of social media trends.”
