Traore graduated from the La Masia academy having grown up just a stone’s thrown from Camp Nou. He returns to the club to become the second signing of the January transfer window, adding to the capture of Ferran Torres. Traore, who can play on the wing and at wing-back, comes with an option to buy worth €30million, which is optional on Barcelona’s part. The signing was announced this evening with the phrase ‘Made in La Masia’. POLL Barcelona are not expected to have any registration issues with Traore, who is said to have taken a reduced wage to complete the deal. With that in mind, he should be eligible to face Atletico Madrid on Sunday, February 6 in a key battle in the race for top four.
