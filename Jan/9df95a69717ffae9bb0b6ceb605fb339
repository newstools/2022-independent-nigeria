Chelsea are not giving up on their attempts to keep Antonio Rudiger. Germany defender Rudiger, 28, is out of contract at the end of the season and has attracted interest from Real Madrid, Paris Saint-Germain and Juventus. But Chelsea are preparing to make a new improved offer for Rudiger who is now free to sign a pre-contract agreement with foreign clubs.

But Rudiger’s recent performances have emphasised his importance to Chelsea, Thomas Tuchel wants to keep him and the Blues are ready to try and step up attempts to keep him. Chelsea striker Romelu Lukaku’s deal is worth over £300,000-a-week after his record £97m move and, while they are unlikely to offer the same terms, they are set to come back with an improved offer. Chelsea defender Malang Sarr has stressed the importance of keeping Rudiger. Sarr said: “He is amazing and off the pitch. What you see is him on the pitch is always giving heart, giving energy and always helping his team mates and you can see how influential he is. “He’s not just big, he’s a good, good player with the ball and he always tries to help the team, not just himself, to bring the toughness to the squad and just to lead.”
