For several years now the National Insurance Commission has been banking on its No Premium No Cover policy which implied that no insurance company should provide any policy cover to either a broker or an insured without a corresponding payment for premium. But, to date it appears the Commission has jettisoned that policy whereby making it possible for insurance firms to continue to extend credits to insured directly or through their intermediaries, a situation that has caused the industry a huge sum of unremitting premium and by extension delay or denial in claims settlements. Of note, the No Premium No cover policy of the National Insurance Commission has hit the rock as operators are still extending credit facility to customers while intermediaries are still keeping premiums meant for insurance underwriters beyond the 30 days’ grace period, Daily Independent finding has revealed.

National Insurance Commission (NAICOM) had in 2012 issued guidelines to protect policy holders and other stakeholders from the existing practice of ‘no payment no cover’ to policy holders whose premiums are in arears, or unremitted. In the guideline, NAICOM had decreed that all insurance operators were required to comply with the new guidelines with effect from the first day of January 2013.
