Nigeria have qualified for the last 16 of the Africa Cup of Nations after a comfortable 3-1 win over Sudan to make it two from two in Group D. An early goal from Villarreal forward Samuel Chukwueze provided a positive start for the three-time champions before Taiwo Awoniyi got their second on the stroke of half-time at the Roumdé Adjia Stadium in Garoua. It took Moses Simon just 30 seconds of the second half to add a third, but Sudan pulled a goal back with a fortuitous penalty, converted by Walieldin Khedr with 20 minutes left.
