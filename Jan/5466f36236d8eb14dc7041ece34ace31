DAMATURU – Irked by the incessant clash between farmers and herders in Yobe State, the United Marketers Association Potiskum (UMAPO) has called on both parties in the state to embrace peace and seek ways to rebuild the state and improve food security. Alhaji Nasiru Mato, Chairman UMAPO made the plea during an interview with Daily Independent in Potiskum town. According to him, the government is working tirelessly to restore normalcy from the trauma of Boko Haram insurgency “and another one is prevailing in the name of farmers and herders. Our businessmen have suffered losses in the peak of insurgency, many have lost their capitals, shops and displaced. We need a permanent peace and atmosphere for business activities”.
