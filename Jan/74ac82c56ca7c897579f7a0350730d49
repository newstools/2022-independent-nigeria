ABUJA – The convener of North’s Healing Campaign, Suleiman Dogara and other renowned activists, on Saturday, drummed up support for the Federal Government’s peace efforts in the Northern region. Also, Dogara said Nigerians must rally round President Muhammadu Buhari’s administration in its quest to bring lasting peace across the country. He said things could have been worse if the Buhari administration had not taken a proactive step as it did in the last six years to decimate the Boko Haram group and other terrorist groups in the country.

Quoting a Human Rights Watch report released in 2016, Dogara recalled that over 10,000 Nigerians were killed by terrorists between 2010 and early 2015 while two million were displaced. By the beginning of 2015, he added that Boko Haram had seized control of 17 local government areas (LGAs) across parts of the northeast in Adamawa, Bauchi, Borno, and Yobe states. However, Dogara recounted the instant success made by troops following Buhari’s emergence with former Chief of Army Staff Lt Gen Tukur Buratai (retd) leading the charge. The activists said not only did Boko Haram receive a bloody nose from Maiduguri to Abuja and other parts of the country, but they were also flushed out to the fringes of Lake Chad. POLL Dogara added that the Armed Forces have achieved this by working with other security agencies to build on the solid legacies for the good of Nigeria. The group said the level of collaboration between sister security agencies played a vital role in turning the tide in favour of the nation.
