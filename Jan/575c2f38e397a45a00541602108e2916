Apostle Yinka Sogunro, a cleric in Cherubim and Seraphim Movement Church, Ijeshatedo, Lagos, and immediate-past Rector, Lagos State Polytechnic (LASPOTECH), Ikorodu, has said the leadership of the Cherubim and Seraphim (C&S) Churches is looking into the issue of prolonged service hours. Sogunro, who spoke during the church’s 50th anniversary celebration and building dedication, noted that though the doctrine of C&S churches gave room for long hours’ service, but many people, especially the youth, could no longer afford to stay for long hours again in a single service, especially on Sundays, hence they moving in drove to Pentecostal churches where they close their services much early. The cleric said though having long-hour service was never a waste of time before God, the leadership of C&S churches had been addressing the issue to bring back run-away members and also entice many others to join the denomination.
