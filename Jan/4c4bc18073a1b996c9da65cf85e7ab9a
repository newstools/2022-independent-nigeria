MAKURDI – Nathaniel Ikyur, the Chief Press Secretary (CPS) to the Benue State gover­nor, Samuel Ortom has stressed that his principal did not victimise any of the kingmakers into vot­ing the new Ochi’Idoma. In a statement signed by the CPS and made avail­able to Daily Independent in Makurdi on Monday, Ikyur stated that the pro­cess that led to the emer­gence of the Ochi’Idoma was based on the Chief­taincy laws of the state. It would be recalled that following the selec­tion process that brought the Och’Idoma-elect, His Royal Majesty, Dr. John Inalegwu Odogbo, the Ochetoha K’Idoma (Idoma National Forum) had al­leged that the process was manipulated by the state government to favour the Ochetoha-elect.

Ikyur stated that “For the avoidance of doubt, Governor Samuel Ortom has no hand in the selec­tion of any traditional ruler or chiefs, either in Idoma Traditional Area or Tiv Traditional Area and at no time did the Governor invite any tra­ditional ruler of Idoma extraction or wheresoev­er to Government house for the purposes connect­ed to or related to the se­lection of the new tradi­tional ruler for the Idoma nation. “The selection of the new Och’Idoma was based on the legal procedure as enshrined in the legal in­struments of the chieftain­cy laws of Benue State. “Contrary to their (Idoma National Forum’s) false claims, due process was followed in the selec­tion exercise as provided by the Benue State Council of Chiefs and Traditional Councils Law 2016.
