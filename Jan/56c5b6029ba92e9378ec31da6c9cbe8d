YENAGOA – The Bayelsa State House of Assembly has passed a two-point resolution urging the state government to investigate the circumstances surrounding the collapse of the state-owned Creek Motel in Yenagoa. It also called on the government to take steps to resuscitate the motel because of its strategic tourism value to the state. The resolution was sequel to a motion moved by the member representing Kolokuma/Opokuma Constituency 1, Tonye Isenah, during plenary on Tuesday.

According to him, the motel served the tourism and hospitality needs of the state and was a viable source of revenue to the government. “Shortly after the Creek Motel was contracted out to foreigners to manage, it went moribund and subsequently closed down under circumstances that were not explained. “Most worrisome is the fact that the once popular Creek Motel has become a safe haven for criminals and all kinds of reptiles, not to talk of the significant loss of revenue to the state government as a result of its continued closure,” Isenah stated. Supporting the motion, the lawmaker representing Ogbia constituency 1, Mitema Obordor, noted that it was within the legislature’s competence to institute a probe into the deplorable condition of the motel that also housed the first set of legislators and other top government functionaries after the creation of Bayelsa. POLL Other members, who took turns to speak on the motion, observed that the state was grappling with infrastructural deficit and there was need to maintain and upgrade facilities instead of abandoning them.
