LAGOS  – Ahead of the 2022 FIFA World Cup playoff between Nigeria and Ghana in March, Kurt Edwin Simon Okraku, the president of Ghana Football Association (GFA), has pre­dicted a tough game between the two West African coun­tries. The former sports writer, who has been the Ghana Foot­ball Association president since 2019, said given the rival­ry between the two countries, he was seen a tough game coming but said he hoped Ghana would advance at the expense of Nigeria. “It is going to be a tough battle against Nigeria because the two countries understand themselves very well. We have played against them on sever­al occasions and I know that they understand us as much as we understand them.

They are doing well in Cameroon but that will not matter and that also should not bother,” he said. Recall that in the playoff draw conducted on Saturday the Black Stars were pitched against the Super Eagles in what has widely been de­scribed as the rekindling of old rivalry. The aggregate winner of the playoff quali­fies for the World Cup in Qatar in November.
