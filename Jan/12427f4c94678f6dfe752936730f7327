BENIN  – Beneficiaries of the Spe­cial Public Work (SPW) in Edo State, have called on the Federal Govern­ment to investigate why some of the banks ac­credited to pay stipends to the beneficiaries have not done so. Addressing journalists in Benin City, Wilson Ima­suen, member, Aggrieved Participants of Special Public Work (APSPW), said the group was a body of registered and verified participants of the federal government 774,000 jobs who are yet to be paid af­ter the rigours of bank registration, meeting at­tendance and participation in the public work. He alleged that one of the new generation banks in Ikpoba Hill in charge of Orhionmwon local govern­ment area was yet to pay any of its verified partic­ipants, hence a thorough investigation to determine the root cause.
