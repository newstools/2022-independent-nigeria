Manchester United manager Ralf Rangnick expects to see a rejuvenated Marcus Rashford after the international break following the England striker’s 93rd-minute winner in the 1-0 victory over West Ham. Rashford has struggled this season and was dropped after going 11 games without a goal before netting at Brentford on Wednesday night. He has now scored in consecutive league games for the first time in more than a year and Rangnick thinks the 24-year-old is ready to show his best form again when United next play in a fortnight. Manchester City’s Long Winning Run Ends In Draw With… Chelsea Sign Teenager Dylan Williams From Derby County ‘Marcus is one of the top strikers in England and has everything you need for a modern forward; pace, skills, size and physicality,’ said Rangnick. ‘In the end it is all about confidence and I am pretty sure those two goals will have raised his confidence. ‘It’s now about him taking the right steps and continuing. I think he will play an important role for the rest of the season.
