Nigeria cannot afford another setback at this critical time of our history”.    On the chances of the PDP, Shelle said the PDP will not disappoint Nigerians in the choice of a presidential candidate that will win the election and help restore the country’s image.  “We just need to work together as a team and strategise accordingly to ensure that APC does not manipulate and compromise the election results. The tide is very much in our favour”.  “PDP will not disappoint Nigerians in their choice of candidate for the Presidential election. The party is working towards presenting a credible, knowledgeable and acceptable candidate that will help restore the image and dignity of the country. Nigeria needs to be reunited and repositioned and PDP will not fail in achieving this goal given another opportunity”.
