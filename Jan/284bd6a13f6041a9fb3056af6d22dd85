LAGOS – Senator Shehu Sani, who represented Kaduna Central in the 8th National Assembly has questioned the implementation of the defense and security budget of the nation from 2016 till date. According to the senator, in spite of the over twelve trillion naira that has been budgeted for security and defense since 2016 till date, there has been continued insecurity in the north and some other regions in the country, while some northern governors incessantly complain that security forces are under-equipped to combat the spate of insecurity in the region. Lamenting, he wrote on his official, verified twitter handle, @ShehuSani “From 2016 to date over 12 trillion Naira has been budgeted for defense and security; yet the Governors of terrorists infested states like Zamfara and Borno have revealed that our forces are under-equipped to fight this war. Where goes all these monies?.” RED ALERT: New Ransomware Attacking Organisational Networks… I Endorsed Tinubu For Presidency In 2019, I Have Rejected Him… See tweet below; From 2016 to date,over 12 trillion Naira has been budgeted for defense and security;yet the Governors of terrorists infested states like Zamfara and Borno have revealed that our forces are under-equipped to fight this war.Where goes all these monies?
