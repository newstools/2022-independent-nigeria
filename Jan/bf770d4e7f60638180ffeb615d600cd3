WARRI – One of the aspirants to the position of President of Egini Community in the just concluded elections for the various positions in the community Executive Council, Evangelist Paul Bukata, has dragged Egini Community to court claiming that since he was the choice of Aghure quarters for the position, Egini Community had no choice but to swear him in as President and not the person so elected by the entire Community electoral committee. In a suit filed at the High Court of Justice holden at Otor-Udu which listed the new President, Mr Midwest Wetah, out-gone President, Deacon Akeem Ughegheruvwe, Chairman of the Screening/Electoral Committee, Mr Pius Moghior and Chairman of the Egini Elders Council, Hon Chief Gordon Okpako as defendants, Evangelist Paul Bukata claimed amongst other things that Egini Community has no right to choose a President outside the one so endorsed by the Aghore quarters, quoting section 14 of the Egini Community Constitution without recourse to other sections of the same constitution which specified elections where more than one aspirant emanates from the quarters. Evang Paul Bukata, in his claims before the Court, desires to be declared the winner by virtue of his nomination and endorsement by Aghore quarter as in Section 14 of the Egini Constitution whereas the same constitution specified elections at Section 16, which was conducted by the six-man Screening/Electoral committee headed by Pius Moghior.

Shortly after the Screening Committee made the result of the elections known in December, Evang Paul Bukata and his supporters filed a petition with the DPO Ovwian-Aladja police station to halt the inauguration of the new Executive pending when the issues are resolved but on Christmas day, the Elders Council met and resolved that since the results have been declared by the relevant authority, the new executive must be inaugurated as planned and that took place on December 26 despite several efforts by Evang Bukata to scuttle the exercise. Incensed by the development, many sons and daughters of Egini Community had expressed dismay with the attitude of the said Evangelist in being the first person to ever drag the Egini community to Court over election matter all because he is hinging all his arguments on a section of the constitution that favoured him leaving other aspects that could not sustain his position on the election. The new President, Midwest Wetah has expressed his preparedness to pursue the legal battle to the end, pledging to run an all-inclusive administration of the community and describing the Court case as a mere distraction which, he said, cannot detract him from the responsibilities before him. Recall that six aspirants were in the race but Midwest Wetah was declared the winner by the electoral committee headed by Pius Moghior before the eventual inauguration on December 26.
