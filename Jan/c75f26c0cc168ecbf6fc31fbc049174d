We refused to follow him to APC because my own ideology is quite different from his own. I told him when he was leaving PDP that I will not follow him there. As a commissioner in his cabinet, I resigned and remained in PDP. “Similarly, Ayade has also failed to delivered on promises or mandate to the people of Cross River state. If you go to our state, you can’t see any developments done by Governor Ayade. So, we all know that he is on a political vogue. “For me, am not a desperate politician, whatever our party decides, I will surely abide by it. But one thing is sure, as a local government Chairman, my work will speak for me. And secondly, our Senator at National Assembly is doing a great job that our people are proud of. All things been equal, we will win.”
