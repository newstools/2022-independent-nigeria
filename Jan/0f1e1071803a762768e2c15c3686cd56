Our players are playing in some of the best leagues in the world and can stand any team on the planet. “Nigeria has always proved bookmakers wrong when the chips are down. We did it in Atlanta in 1996 with the Olympic team and in 2013 in South Africa, against all odds, the Super Eagles emerged as African champions. “While I wish the Super Eagles and their technical team best of luck, I want to charge them to approach their opening match with optimism, resilience and patriotism to put smiles on the faces of over 200 million Nigerians who are all expecting a positive result from them. “I know you can do it and we are all solidly behind you. The Federal Government delegation led by the Honourable Speaker, Rt. Hon  Femi Gbajabiamila who was represented by the Deputy Speaker is capable of giving you all the support you need to do the nation proud,” he stated.
