Nollywood actress and filmmaker, Toyin Abraham is breathing fire down the necks of those who have chosen to denigrate her husband, Kolawole Ajeyemi. A few days back, Ajeyemi took delivery of a Lexus SUV for his birthday, with many insinuating that his actress wife is behind the new car. However, in an Instagram post, the actress called out people insinuating that she bought the car for her husband, noting that Ajeyemi is a hard-working man who does a lot for her. “I don’t usually do this and I am only going to address this just once and I hope this ends here. People need to stop this mentality that famous people or the more famous ones are the richest in their family, relationships or even friendships. Just because some people do not like to blow their own horns doesn’t mean they should be seen as less or incapable.

Do not ridicule his hard work and what he stands for. Everything he has, he’s worked for with his own sweat and he deserves it. “I am the last born of my family and you’d think I’m the richest just because I’m famous which is far from the truth. It is 2022 please, we need to do better and stop this ill-mannered mentality. Celebrate people without trying to pitch them against another person or ridicule their hard work or give credit to another. It’s so old and needs to stop,” she wrote.
