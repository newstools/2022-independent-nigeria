ABAKALIKI – Ohanaeze Ndigbo, a pan-Igbo socio-cultural group, has claimed that that the Arewa Consultative Forum (ACF) and the Northern elders are behind President Muhammadu Buhari’s refusal to release Nnamdi Kanu, leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB). The group noted that they foretold that Nnamdi Kanu will not be released by Federal Government in their 2022 New Year message to Ndigbo, “because of evidence of infighting, misguided assertions, and utterances of the southeastern leaders and IPOB”. A press release issued by Mazi Okechukwu Isiguzoro, Secretary General, Ohaneze Ndigbo Worldwide on Thursday stated that “we keep warning about the approach, missteps, assertions and infighting in the camp of IPOB and amongst Igbo leadership will derail the proposed release of Nnamdi Kanu through diplomatic efforts, those dispatched to initiate the procedure of the unconditional release of Nnamdi Kanu changed course and seized the opportunity of being saddled with the burden and responsibilities for their immediate considerations and gains”.
