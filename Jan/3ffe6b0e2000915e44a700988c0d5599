Udinese goalkeeper Marco Silvestri parried a shot from Sergej Milinkovi´c-Savi´c and then defender Destiny Udogie blocked Raúl Moro´s effort on the follow-up. Udinese went close to breaking the deadlock early in extra time when Tolgay Arslan´s strike was deflected onto the woodwork but it was Immobile who eventually made the difference. The Italy forward – who had been brought on in the 71st minute – ran onto a long ball over the top from fellow substitute Danilo Cataldi and chipped it over Silvestri.
