Kennedy Boboye, the coach of reigning Akwa United, has expressed optimism that they would defend the Nigeria Professional Foot­ball League (NPFL) title with the help of everybody. Recall that the “Promise Keepers” won their maiden Nigerian topflight title last season after their good run. Speaking on their chanc­es this season, the former Plateau United manager said it would be difficult to retain the title but ex­pressed optimism that they would give it their best shot in order to win.

Akwa United are fifth on the log with seven points from four games. In their last match, they lost 0-2 to Nasarawa United in Lagos in a match they were tipped to get at least a point. Also last weekend, sister team, Dakkada United were held at home by Remo Stars. The match ended 1-1 which elicited poor reaction from the assistant coach of the home team. The action led to the League Management Com­pany (LMC) banishing Dak­kada and fining cumulative N3.5 million.
