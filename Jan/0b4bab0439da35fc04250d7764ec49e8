At least 25 people have died thus far in an ongoing ISIS attack against Ghweiran prison in northeastern Syria, said the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR). It said violent clashes are taking place inside the prison between ISIS militiamen – among whom are many freed prisoners – and Kurdish security forces. The jihadists “have taken complete control”, security and anti-terrorist forces are fighting back and suffering “numerous victims”, SOHR said.

The attack began yesterday evening in the Hasake region, against one of the prisons run by the Kurdish-Syrian forces supported by the United States. ISIS was declared militarily defeated in Syria in the spring of 2019, but its cells continue to operate in the country’s east and northeast. The Kurdish-Syrian forces, which originated from the Kurdish Workers’ Party (PKK) that Turkey considers a terrorist organization, had in recent days warned of the risk of ISIS attacks against prisons where jihadist militiamen are held.
