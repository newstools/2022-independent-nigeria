The former Arsenal star has been restricted to just five appearances across all competitions for the Bianconeri in 2021-22, and Allegri openly admitted at the start of the January window that the club were seeking to move him on. “Ramsey, he returned after we had given him a few days off to work, to train separately, in England,” the Juve boss said at the start of the month. “In any case, he’s an outgoing player.” (SOURCE: Goal)
