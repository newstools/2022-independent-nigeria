Austin Eguavoen, interim coach of the Nigeria national team, has stepped down. This has come after the Super Eagles’ 1-0 defeat to Tunisia in the 2021 Africa Cup of Nations round of 16 clashes on Sunday. Eguavoen had led the three-time champions to three straight wins against Egypt, Sudan and Guinea-Bissau. However, the team fell short against a Covid-19-stricken Tunisian team in the knock-out stages. Said Eguavoen after the match: “What happens next is that I’m the interim coach and Technical Director of the Nigeria Football Federation (NFF). “I will go back to my position and allow the NFF to make a decision on the way forward”. Eguavoen stepped in after Gernot Rohr was sacked last month. However, the NFF announced Jose Peseiro as the new permanent coach before the AFCON kick-off.
