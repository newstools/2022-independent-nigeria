Frontline governorship as­pirant, legal practitioner, and the Okiemutero Ovie of Ughelli Kingdom, Olo­rogun Barrister Fred Ok­iemute Majemite, has sent greetings to Governor If­eanyi Okowa and the people of Delta State in his prayers for peace and progress in 2022. Majemite, at the week­end, said that 2022 is a year to demonstrate together­ness, peace, patience, toler­ance and love to neighbours because many were yet to overcome the effects of the Covid-19 and its Omicron variant. The governorship aspi­rant urged Deltans to use the solemnity which the yuletide season provided to also examine their spiritual lives so that they could be more spiritually prepared for the end time challenges that had been manifesting across the globe. 2023: Sanusi Urges Nigerians To Get Voters Card, Elect Competent… BREAKING: Diesel Tanker Tumbles, Spills Content Majemite also urged Delt­ans to specifically pray for Delta State and her leaders. While wishing Okowa a prosperous New Year, Ma­jemite noted that Okowa and Chief James Ibori, former governor of Delta State, had done so much to ensure that Delta State remained very peaceful. This, he said, should be sustained to attract invest­ments that would enhance further growth and employ­ment in the urban towns in Delta State as well as in the riverine areas.
