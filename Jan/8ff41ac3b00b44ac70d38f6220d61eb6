IBADAN  – Mr. Usman Muhideen Bamidele, the founder of Dele Bajaj Foundation (DBF) has declared that he has no political am­bition as a result of his philanthropy as being peddled around by peo­ple. Speaking with Satur­day INDEPENDENT on Friday about his recent empowerment scheme where over 500 Ibarapa indigenes went home with smiles on their faces, Bamidele reiter­ated that taking care of the needy in the society should not be limited only to those in political offices. He said, “I’m not a politician neither am I contesting for any po­litical office. For me, I don’t think I need to be a politician or contest any political office, or nurse a political ambition before I can assist my people who are in need.

I love giving back to the soci­ety, especially where I’m from, I believe this will go a long way in assisting our society for better. “My Foundation is purely a charity-based or­ganisation, it’s non-profit­able and non-governmen­tal organization. It was founded with the aim of building a formidable so­ciety through youth em­powerment and develop­ing capacities of different forms,” he said. Bamidele, through his Foundation, has helped a lot of youths and adults in the Ibarapa axis of Oyo State, among are the recently empowered 500 beneficiaries who were equipped with a series of tools and cash worth millions of naira such as sewing machines, pepper grinding machines, deep freezers, generators, hair dryers among others.
