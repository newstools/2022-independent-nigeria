U.S. Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer will retire at the end of the court’s term this summer, allowing President Joe Biden to name his first nominee to the high court—here’s who could be on his shortlist. Biden has publicly committed to placing a Black woman on the Supreme Court, and White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said Wednesday the president “stands by” that commitment, even as she declined to confirm media reports of Breyer’s retirement. Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit and California Supreme Court Justice Leondra R. Kruger widely viewed as the primary contenders.

Kruger was previously a lawyer for the U.S. Department of Justice at the solicitor general’s office during George W. Bush and Barack Obama’s presidencies. House Majority Whip Rep. James Clyburn (D-S.C.) has pushed Biden to consider U.S. District Judge J.

Other potential Black female contenders who have been floated for the job include U.S. District Judges Wilhelmina Wright and Leslie Abrams Gardner—the sister of Georgia gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams—and NAACP Legal Defense Fund President Sherrilyn Ifill.
