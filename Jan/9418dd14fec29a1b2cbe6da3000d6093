The Nigerian Guild of Edi­tors (NGE) will on Wednes­day hold a Town Hall Meeting for the North-West geo-polit­ical zone at the Tahir Guest Palace (Hotel), Kano. The NGE, late last year, announced its plans to hold town hall meetings across the six geo-political zones, kick­ing off the meeting in the South-West zone in Novem­ber last year, in Lagos. The main objective of the meeting with the theme: “Agenda Setting for Sustain­able Democratic Culture,” which is being supported by the United States (US) Em­bassy in Nigeria is to assess the media performance in consolidating Nigeria’s de­mocracy – citizens’ verdict and outlining media agenda for the future.

Drawing abundant in­stances from democracies around the world, the state­ment added that the meeting will be taken across the six geo-political zones of the country, with the aim of in­stilling in the editors the need to perform their duties with the highest form of profes­sional standards and sense of responsibility. “The town hall meeting will provide a platform for media stakeholders to under­take self-scrutiny and also be­gin a robust conversation on a framework for media reg­ulation, which will not only have their buy-in but also ad­vance the standard for media practice in Nigeria thereby reducing, if not eliminate, in­cidents of sub-standard and unprofessional reportage in the Nigerian media.
