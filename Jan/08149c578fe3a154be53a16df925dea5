Florence Ifeoluwa Otedola, professionally known as DJ Cuppy, has called out American Rapper, Kanye West to school him for claiming to be the richest black man. Recall that the rapper in an interview with ‘Hollywood Unlocked’ expressed that even though he was the richest black man, he has been denied the privilege to see his children. “My daughter wanted me to go inside. I was like, I am the richest black man and North’s father, right, and the security was able to stop me from going into the room with my daughter, and that had not been defined,” he said.

I am a HUGE @KanyeWest fan. “However with ALL due respect, I feel the need to remind him that he is not the “richest black man” -it is in fact my Godfather @AlikoDangote. Just clearing the air with #Facts,” she wrote.
