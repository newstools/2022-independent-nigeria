Comrade Patrick Abba Moro, the Senator repre­senting Benue South Sen­atorial District, has plead­ed with those who oppose the process that led to the emergence of Dr. John Elaigwu Odogbo as the new Och’Idoma to exercise restraint and sheath their swords. Moro, in a statement he personally signed, urged everyone in Idomaland to accept Odogbo’s election as the new monarch and join hands with him to preserve the Idoma traditions and culture. The statement reads: “Since the election of Dr John Elaigwu Odogbo as the successor paramount ruler of the Idoma Kingdom, claims and counter claims have been trending in the so­cial and mainstream media. 2023: Sanusi Urges Nigerians To Get Voters Card, Elect Competent… BREAKING: Diesel Tanker Tumbles, Spills Content “This certainly is not healthy for the cohesion and peaceful coexistence of the good people of the Idoma Kingdom. This has com­pelled me to make this call for calm and restraint on the part of all parties involved. “I’m aware that some per­sons are not happy with the process of the election of the successor Och’Idoma V. Understandably so. “Some persons lost the election and one person won. But, in the contest of this nature for one posi­tion, only one person can and will win. The election of Och’Idoma V is not and cannot be an exception. “While accepting, but not conceding that any of the other contestants could have won, the reality on ground is that Dr. John Elaigwu Odogbo won. “While some persons may not be too pleased with the process of the election, the truth is that the exercise was conducted in line with the existing Benue State Chieftaincy law 2016. POLL “Though the law may not completely be in tandem with all aspects of the tradi­tions and culture of the land, it is the law. As law-abiding citizens, we must accept and abide by it.
