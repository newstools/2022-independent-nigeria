Turkey raised household electricity and natural gas prices as of Saturday, citing the surge in global energy prices. The price increases for electricity were between 52% and 130% for households, the Haberturk newspaper estimated, as the country switched to a gradual fare system. Under the new system, households will pay 1.37 liras ($0.09) per kilowatt hour for electricity up to 150 kilowatt hour usage per month, and 2.06 liras ($0.14) per kilowatt hour for consumption exceeding that limit as of Jan. 1, the nation’s energy markets regulator said in a statement late Friday.

The moves could further drive Turkish inflation, which is expected to accelerate to 27.4% in December, according to the median estimate in a Bloomberg survey. Turkey’s statistics institute will announce the actual figure on Monday.
