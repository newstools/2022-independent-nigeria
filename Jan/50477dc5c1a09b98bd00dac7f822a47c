LAGOS – Hon. Kunle Okunola, a chieftain of the All Progressives Congress (APC) and convener Tinubu Not Negotiable (TNN) has said that the defection of the convener of Lagos4Lagos movement, Olajide Adediran, to the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) is premature.  According to Okunola in a chat with Daily Independent, there are lots of activities that are about to happen in Nigeria, pointing out that Nigerians exhibit voter’s apathy because the two major political parties, APC and PDP have failed them.  He said, “With the present situation of things in the country, you will realize that there is voters’ apathy during elections and voter apathy is as a result of Nigerians not being interested in the two main political parties in the country, APC and PDP. People believe that it is a waste of time to get registered and begin to vote for the same set of people who keep jumping from one party to another. “If Lagos4Lagos has gone to a third party and created a stronger force against PDP and APC it would have made sense. Jumping from APC to PDP and going back and forth, I must say that Nigerians are tired of that kind of prostitution. Where there is no principle or ideology and so there is no threat to anybody because the only people that complain are those without voters’ cards,” Okunola said. He added, “It is only if Lagos State is not able to bring reliable people in the third party that Lagosians may want to consider managing the choice of candidates from thee two major political parties. I think that Lagosians and Nigerians are actually looking out for a formidable and reliable third force, and it is too early for anybody at this point in time to start speculating about who is going to win between the PDP and the APC. Both of them can be at loggerheads because an organized smaller party can still beat them during elections.”
