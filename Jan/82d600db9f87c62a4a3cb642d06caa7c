POLL The nation’s political environment and governances have been influenced by insecurity and various COVID- 19 had slow down government and economic activities despite the huge amount the government had pumped into security budgets in many years till date. President Muhammadu Buhari signed the 2021 Appropriation Bill into law on the 31st of December, 2020. The budgeted expenditure of N13.59 Trillion was 4% higher than the initial N13.08 Trillion presented to the National Assembly (NASS) in Oct 2020. The budget was based on the revenue assumption of 1.86 million barrels of Crude Oil per day at $40 per barrel and an exchange rate of N360/$. However, with the need to increase the number of vaccinated citizens against the COVID-19 and the quest to curtail the rising rate of insecurities in the country, the president approved a supplementary budget of N982.73 Billion. Volatile Market Environment Amidst Seasonal Trends And Patterns,… Fidelity Bank 2021-9M: Robust Loan-Deposit Ratio, Better Profit,… In the Supplementary budget, N39.58 came from the World Bank Loan, N135 Billion from Special Lobby Account, while N722.53 Billion came from domestic and Foreign Borrowings. Also, the fund was to acquire N83.56 Billion worth of J&J Covid-19 Vaccine, N1.69 billion for the Nigerian Comprehensive AIDS programme, N40 billion under the public service-wide wage adjustments to take care of the needs for allowances to the health and education sector, and N770.60 billion for defence spending. President Muhammadu Buhari again just signed 2022 budget into law yesterday, after the National Assembly had increased the appropriation bill to N17 trillion, tagged Budget of Economic Growth and Sustainability. The budget expenditure is estimated at N17 trillion, which is 25.09% higher than N13.59 trillion of 2021 budget. The 2022 budget was assumed based on an exchange rate of N410.15/$ (vs N379/$ for 2021), 1.88mbpd oil production at $57pb (vs 1.86mbpd oil production at $40pb), GDP target of 4.20% and an inflation target of 13.00%. However, the budget revenue is estimated at N10.13 trillion, while the budget deficit rose by 14.4% compared to the 2021 budget deficit of N6.26 trillion. Of which, the budget deficit is to be financed by borrowings from Domestic sources (N2.51 trillion), Foreign sources (N2.51 trillion), multi-lateral/bi-lateral loan (N1.16 trillion) and Privatization proceed (N90.7 billion). Meanwhile, looking at the budget deficit of N6.26 trillion, 3.39% of the nation’s GDP and 0.39% above the threshold of 3%, we believe that the government needs to expand its revenue base by taxing the informal sector and reviewing excise duties on certain goods. On August 16, 2021, the long-awaited Petroleum Industry Bill (PIB) was finally signed into law by President Muhammadu Buhari (now Petroleum Industry Act) to end nearly two decades of political gymnastics on the bill. For context, the PIB is omnibus legislation aimed at repositioning the Nigerian oil & gas industry through far-reaching reforms in four (4) key areas of Governance, Administration, Host Communities Welfare, and Fiscal Provision. Despite being Nigeria’s leading source of FX earnings (c.90.0% of goods export earnings) and the largest source of FG’s revenue (c.58.0%), the oil & gas industry in Nigeria is still largely governed by the outdated Petroleum Profit Tax (PPT) Act of 1959 and the Petroleum Act of 1969. The PIA, however, signified the end of the Department of Petroleum Resource (DPR), Petroleum Products Pricing Regulatory Agency (PPPRA) and the Petroleum Equalization Fund (PEF). While the Midstream and Downstream Petroleum Regulatory Authority, Upstream Regulatory Commission was inaugurated Nigeria economy sustained it expansion move GDP grew in real-term by 4.03% in Q3’2021, sustaining recovery to four consecutive quarters. The Non-Oil component of the GDP expanded by 5.44%, compared to the 6.74% expansion in Q2’2021. This was impacted by the 8.41% and 2.28% slow growth in the Services and Agricultural Sectors, respectively, compared to the 9.27% expansion and 1.30% expansion in Q2’2021. However, the decline could be attributed to the high rate of insecurities, high electricity tariffs, and the high cost of doing business in Nigeria. However, the Oil component of the GDP contracted by 10.73%, compared to the 12.65% contraction in Q2’2022 despite the 7.4% increase in the average crude oil (Bonny Light) price to $73.84/barrel. The sectoral contribution to the real GDP in Services, Agriculture and Industries was 49.65%, 29.94% and 20.41% in Q3’2021, compared to 55.66%, 23.78% and 20.57%, respectively in Q2’2021. This implies that only the Agriculture sector had a positive growth contribution to the real GDP quarterly. The consumer price index moderated in 2021 according NBS on a base effect, as Inflation rate for November 2021 stood at 15.44% to record the lowest rate in 12 months. The Core Inflation has been consistently rising in 2021, following the two times devaluation of naira in 2020 and high electricity tariff, which has drastically affected the price of many Non-farm produced and imported goods. The Food inflation stood at 17.21% in Nov’2021, compared to 18.30% in Nov’2020, representing eight consecutive months of decline in the food inflation rate. This was driven by the base effect, harvest season, and various CBN interventions in the agricultural sector. Aggregately, the Headline inflation has been increasing at a slow rate from the beginning of Q2’2021, as a result of the base year effect of 2020 when the economy began to feel the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic. CBN Monetary policy committee, in the spirit of driving economy recovery and expansion to create job and price stability, had decided to retain the Monetary Policy Rate(MPR) at 11.5%, throughout the year 2021 compared to other EMDEs nations tightening up their respective rates. The MPC decisions follow the bid for a stable economic recovery from the impact of Covid-19 pandemic, as the GDP expanded by 4.03% and 5.01% in Q3’2021 and Q2’2021, respectively. Just as recovery in oil price above its pre-pandemic levels in February 2021 have supported the nation economic recovery and growth recorded in the year, the global benchmark price, rose to a seven-year high (USD86.40/bbl) in October.Overall, the Brent crude price increased by 48.2% YTD to USD76.56/ barrel as of 31st December. The price rally was impacted by the increase in demand due to impressive vaccine administration in western countries, sustained restriction on production by OPEC+, shortfalls in output in the US and other non-OPEC producers, and the increased use of crude oil as a substitute for natural gas – owing to higher gas prices – for petrochemical and heating fuel and electricity generation supported the rally in oil prices To continued 2021 Recap and Outlook for 2022 Next Week
