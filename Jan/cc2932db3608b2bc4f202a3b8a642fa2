The princess is doing fine but will be seeking medical expertise. She seems worn out but is in good spirits, and thankful to reunite with her sons in person,” her legal advisor Henri Estramant told the Jerusalem Post. He did not mention the reason the two were released and the motivation and timing of the Saudi government remain unclear. The Princess is the daughter of Saudi Arabia’s King Abdul Aziz, who ruled the country from 1953-64. In a series of tweets in 2020, the princess appealed to her cousin, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, to be freed. At the time, she said her health had been deteriorating.
