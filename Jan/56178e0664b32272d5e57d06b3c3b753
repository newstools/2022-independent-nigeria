UGHELLI – His Royal Majesty (Barr) Godspower Oporomo ,Taraeza 1of Kerebiri-Mein kingdom in Bomadi Local Government Area of Delta State, has assured his subjects that victory and freedom from oppression were certain as Kerebiri-Mein Kingdom remained an Ijaw kingdom and had never been part of Benin Kingdom. Oporomo gave the assurance at the occasion of his fifth coronation at Bomadi, yesterday, noting that God did not support injustice and oppression and urged his subjects to be strong and prayerful. He said the oppression meted out to Kerebiri-Mein Kingdom by her sister Akugbene-Mein Kingdom for decades, working hard to frustrate them from government recognition, was unjust and uncalled for, stressing that no Ijaw kingdom could exercise lordship over other Ijaw kingdom.
