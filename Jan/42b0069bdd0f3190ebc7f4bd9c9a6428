Ondo State Governor Oluwarotimi Akeredolu has expressed surprise over the effrontery of suspected Fulani herders launching attacks on communities in the state despite the security measures. Akeredolu disclosed this on Tuesday while appointing the Commander of Amotekun Corps in the state, Akogun Adetunji Adeleye as his Special Adviser on Security Matters. According to him, he never imagined that the security threat in the state would get to its current point.

The governor emphasised that the invasion of communities and villages by criminals masquerading as herdsmen was part of what informed his decision to have a Special Adviser who had been part of the system. While disclosing that Adeleye will continue to function as the Corps’ Commander, Akeredolu noted that the appointment was part of the efforts towards improving the working relationship between government and security agencies in the state. “That people will have the audacity to come to our villages and communities, kill our people and set their houses ablaze. I knew I needed to do something. Part of my immediate reaction is what you are seeing here today. “I am a practical person. And I have seen that we are faced with a lot of challenges. I know that my SSA on Security is never part of our executive council and I am convinced that we have a security council meeting, only few of us here are on it.”
