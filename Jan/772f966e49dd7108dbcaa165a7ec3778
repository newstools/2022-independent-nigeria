OWERRI  – Amidst the persistent clam­our by the South east re­gion for a president of Igbo extraction to succeed Pres­ident Muhammadu Buhari, chairman of the National Democratic Mandate Group (NDMG), Imo State chapter, Chikwe Nwachukwu, has advised champions of the project to drop their agita­tion, which he described as parochial and naïve. According to him, in­stead of being immersed in the quest for a president of Igbo extraction, the champions of the agitation should embark on a clinical search for a leader with the necessary vision capacity foresight and administra­tive acumen who believes in justice, unity and equity to rescue the nation from its current state of abyss irre­spective of his geo-political zonal background. In an exclusive interview with our correspondent the NDMG chieftain argued that given the current state of the nation, Nigerians should purge themselves of tribal sentiments and ethnic cleavages and look for a visionary leader who had the interest of the na­tion at heart to tackle the litany of woes confronting the people. 2023: Sanusi Urges Nigerians To Get Voters Card, Elect Competent… BREAKING: Diesel Tanker Tumbles, Spills Content “Before, Dubai was al­most a desert, but today, it has become the word destination centre for com­merce, industry, agricul­ture, manufacturing, sci­ence and technology and this was made possible by a purposeful, dynamic, visionary and pragmatic leadership and this is what we want,” he stated
