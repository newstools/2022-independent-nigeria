Nigerian singer and songwriter, Oluwatobiloba Daniel Anidugbe, popularly knowns as Kizz Daniel, has revealed that the birth of his sons made him change his attitude and behaviour towards people. He disclosed this during an interview with TheWill Downtown Magazine, expressing that when he meets people, he treats them better, just like how he wants his sons to be treated by other people. The singer said, “First I’d like to say thank God for my kids, for my boys. I wake up every morning and I’m grateful to God for blessing me. Although people will say you have two boys, I know I have three boys because God gave me three boys. So I say a prayer for him every day. And to answer the question I’d say it made me more aware of what’s going on around me. I’m a father and I’m quite particular about energy not just around me but around everyone close to my kids and the mother of my kids. It made me more responsible.

I used to be a sports car enthusiast, now I’m an SUV guy. I just bought a 2021 Lexus 520 and when I wanted to get it, I knew I wouldn’t drive it. All my cars are sports cars; I’m not a big car kind of guy but now I have to be one. “It also made me a better person regarding how to treat people. When I meet new people, I can’t quite place my finger on it but the vibe is very different because now, you’re treating people the way you want them to treat your kids. They’ll soon grow up, go into the world and when they are feeling cheery or downcast, they’ll call home or experience those emotions first-hand. So yeah, I’m a better person for it.” Recall that the singer welcomed a set of triplets last year, however, he lost one of them after a few days.  He also gifted his sons, Jalil and Jelani 2 bedroom penthouse apartments in Lekki, Lagos.
