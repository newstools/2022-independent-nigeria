It was presided over by the party’s deputy national Chairman (North), Dr Abdul Ahmed Isiaq, who was hitherto suspended by the party. Isiaq who was readmitted into the party on Saturday by the NEC, said the emergency meeting was called based on the provisions of Article 14 (2)1 which states that the NEC may summon an emergency any time it seems fit provided a seven-day notice is given to all those statutory to attend. Attempts to disrupt the gathering by some youth allegedly loyal to the Agunloye camp were repelled by security operatives present at the venue of the meeting which held in a hotel at Area 3, Garki Abuja.
