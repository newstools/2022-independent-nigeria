Social media giant Facebook, now known as Meta Platforms, faces a 2.3 billion pounds-plus ($3.2 billion-plus) class action lawsuit in the UK over allegations it abused its market dominance by exploiting the personal data of 44 million users. Liza Lovdahl Gormsen, a senior adviser to Britain’s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) watchdog and a competition law academic, said she was bringing the case on behalf of people in Britain who had used Facebook between 2015 and 2019. The lawsuit, which London’s Competition Appeal Tribunal will hear, alleges Facebook made billions of pounds by imposing unfair terms and conditions that demanded consumers surrender valuable personal data to access the network.
