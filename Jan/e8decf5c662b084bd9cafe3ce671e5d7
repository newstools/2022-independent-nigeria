LAGOS  – Lagos Chamber of Commerce and Industry (LCCI) has called on the Federal Government to use the lessons learnt from the suspension of Twitter to creating a realistic template for regulating digital platforms in Nigeria for maximum benefits. Dr. Chinyere Almona, LCCI’s Director General in a statement said: “The Federal Government’s press statement conveying the lifting of the suspension of Twitter operations in Nigeria is well received and commendable. “The operations of the microblogging platform were shut down on the 5th of June 2021 by the Federal Government due to the use of the platform for subversive purposes and criminal activities that were seen as threats to national security and social cohesion.
