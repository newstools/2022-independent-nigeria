OWERRI – Ahead of the nation’s 2023 general elec­tions, the National Secretary of the People’s Democratic Party (PDP), Senator Samuel Any­anwu (Aka Samdaddy) has boasted that the party would carry out a clinical selection process for its presidential flag bearer that will be accept­able to all Nigerians in order to dislodge the ruling All Pro­gressives Congress (APC). Senator Anyanwu, who spoke to newsmen in his country home Amaimo in the Ikeduru Council Area of Imo State, said the recent success of the party’s national con­vention and the increasing mass defection of members of other political parties to the PDP has further brightened the prospects of the umbrella symbol party to regain power in the next political dispensa­tion. “The APC will end with the expiration of the second tenure of President Muham­madu Buhari and also fizzle out. This is a party that came up with a mantra in 2015 that eventually turned into a Tro­jan horse, agony, misery, pen­ury, hunger, and lamentations to the average Nigerian and so it cannot last beyond 2023”. Insecurity: Path To Nationhood Unpredictable, Says Buhari In New… ASATU Projects Prosperous New Year For Ndi-Anambra The PDP scribe who took a critical assessment of the situation of the nation noted that while insurgency had continued to hold the nation by the jugular resulting in the ceaseless massacre, kidnap­ping, abduction, rape, armed robbery and destruction of people’s property. The value of the naira has continued to depreciate thereby giving birth to unprecedented infla­tion. He queried the wisdom be­hind the refusal of the Presi­dent to assent to the Electoral Bill Act, which would pave way for a smooth transition in 2023, stressing that “the APC is on the neck of Nigerians and so they cannot breathe anymore,”. The PDP chieftain who also faulted frequent borrowing by the president to run the affairs of the nation as well as his in­ability to tackle the COVID 19 pandemic assured Nigerians would only heave a sigh of relief when the PDP, which is conversant with yearnings and aspirations of the masses comes back to power in 2023 to save the nation from further degeneration.
