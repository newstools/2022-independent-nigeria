An auction house, Heritage Auction, said a Marvel Comics page featuring the first appearance of Spider-Man’s iconic black costume was sold for a record-breaking $3.36 million. The artwork, originally done by Mike Zeck, page 25 of Secret Wars No. 8 in 1984 is now known to be the world’s most valuable page of original comic book artwork after it was auctioned for $3.36 million. The page featured the first appearance of Spider-Man’s black costume, an alien symbiote which later became half of the villain and sometimes anti-hero ‘Venom’.
