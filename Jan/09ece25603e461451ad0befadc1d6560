He said it was unacceptable for people to destroy the environment while the international oil companies were continually blamed for the same reason. Diri, therefore, asked the operators escaping from Rivers to stay away from Bayelsa as his administration had set up a standing committee to arrest and prosecute anyone caught in the illicit business. He said, “Whatever that happens in Rivers State is transported down here (Bayelsa). We have intelligence that most of them (operators of illegal refineries) want to move to Bayelsa. “I want to warn that Bayelsa will not condone any of those oil bunkering. Those days are over. We have moved on. POLL “Anyone who is planning to leave Rivers State to come and start that illicit, illegitimate, illegal business in Bayelsa State, please, have a change of mind and look elsewhere. “Because we already have a standing committee on that from our state security council meeting and we will come down very hard on anyone that will do that illegal and illegitimate business in Bayelsa.”
