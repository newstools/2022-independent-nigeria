He has helped the club to win the FA Cup, the League Cup and the UEFA Europa League. “The 26-year-old featured as recently as Saturday’s 1-0 win over West Ham United, when he was a late substitute and involved in the move which led to Marcus Rashford’s injury-time winner. “However, Martial has been open about his desire to seek more regular first-team football, and will now hope to find that with the Rojiblancos, who currently lie second in La Liga.”
