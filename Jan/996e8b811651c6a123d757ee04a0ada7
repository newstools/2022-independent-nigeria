Liverpool have been backed to sign Arsenal starlet Bukayo Saka in the near future. The Reds were tentatively linked with the Gunners forward last week, who has been in good form this season. It was claimed in the Transfer Window podcast, via The Express, that Saka is a player who suits Liverpool’s style of play.

Now, former Leeds United striker Noel Whelan has agreed with those claims that Saka would be a good fit for Liverpool. However, Whelan went on to argue that Arsenal would not want to let Saka go cheaply, hinting that Liverpool would be forced into paying a sizable transfer fee. “Absolutely, I can see him at Liverpool,” Whelan told Football Insider . “I don’t think it was that long ago that they were trying to tempt him over to Anfield when he was running out of contract at Arsenal. POLL “We have seen the development in Saka – he’s now one of the best wingers in the Premier League. “The way he gets on the ball, the way he dictates a game, he’s very much a Liverpool style player. “However, it seems to be that Mikel Arteta is building something really quite special at Arsenal right now. “I’m sure the club won’t want to let him go for any money and show their strength in the market. “They’ll want to show they’re not a selling club and really continue with this rebuild.”
