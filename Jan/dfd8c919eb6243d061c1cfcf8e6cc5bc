Arsenal are still finalising the squad for their warm-weather training camp in Dubai, which starts on Thursday, but Aubameyang is currently not expected to be part of the group.

The Gunners have received loan offers from Middle East clubs and they would cover Aubameyang’s salary, which has a base wage of around £250,000 a week. There is also interest from clubs in Europe and a loan move to one of those parties may force Arsenal to cover some of the forward’s wages. Aubameyang’s departure would leave Arsenal short on attacking options for the rest of the season and they are still struggling to sign a striker, with reports in Italy overnight stating that Juventus are now firming up a deal for Fiorentina’s Dusan Vlahovic. Arsenal want to do business and manager Mikel Arteta is currently in America as part of a pre-planned trip to see owner Stan Kroenke.
