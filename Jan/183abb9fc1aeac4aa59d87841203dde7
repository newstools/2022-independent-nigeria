You can imagine all the lawlessness exhibited by motorists, especially the use of branded plate numbers without the necessary licence to back it. “We must ensure that we carry out our duties effectively by enforcing the laws because without enforcement, they become recalcitrant.” He said.” In her response, the VIO Zonal Commander, appreciated the open door Policy of the Area Commander and the high level of cooperation accorded her predecessors responsible for the level of success they had. She said, “I’m very happy to meet you, our organisation is split into three Zonal areas; Ogun East, Central and West, which is under my jurisdiction, and I desire to have the level of synergy that will enhance our operations and enable us improve the level of compliance currently obtained by motorists under my Zonal Command.” “It has always been my culture to form a strong alliance with the police formations within my jurisdiction, especially with the various Divisional Police officers. I always reach out to them to ensure the enforcement side of our operations against erring motorists. In the same vein, I’m reiterating this request here, for your prompt response whenever I call for it or the need arises.” She added. POLL Oluwatoyin also pointed out the current effort of her agency to improve the state of vehicles plying our roads through the enforcement of the computerised vehicle inspection tests that will soon become mandatory for all vehicles to undergo, stressing that it is not a ploy to generate revenues or sanction vehicle owners but to improve safety on our roads. CSP Idehai Godwin, DPO, Sango-Ota Police Command, also assured her of the maximum cooperation of his Command anytime the need arises. He however asked that more sensitisation exercise should be carried out regarding the vehicle inspection tests before enforcement. Speaking further, ACP Obe called for the cooperation of the VIO whose facility is used to park vehicles impounded by his Command to always alert him when the need arises for his intervention or to iron out any grey area. He urged the VIO and other sister agencies to be professional in discharging their duties as laws were made to guide the citizens.
