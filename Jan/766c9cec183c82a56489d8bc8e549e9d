Killings, kidnappings, sexual and gender-based violence are taking a severe toll on women and girls, who are the soft targets of evil perpetrators. “The case of Aisha Umar, an IDP, who was lured and raped by a humanitarian provider that led her to committing suicide in Maiduguri, Borno State as she could not stand the trauma and the brutal murder of the son of a Gender activist, Madam Ene Ede in Abuja recently by yet to be identified murderers, to mention but a few, are all indicators that all is not well in our dear country. “As mothers, we ever with pains that this is no longer Nigeria we grew up to know where the care for the younger generation was the responsibility of all adults and the community as a whole.” She added that “as mothers, we appeal to Nigerians to be more vigilant, security conscious as well as report suspicious characters to security agencies. NGOs and CSOs must speak out against these evil acts and demand justice for victims of ritual killings and sexual abuse in Nigeria”.
