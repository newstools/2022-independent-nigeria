LAGOS – Inner Wheel District 912 Nigeria marked the Found­ers’ Day with empower­ment of some Nigerians. Founded in Manchester, United Kingdom, Inner Wheel marked 98 years on January 10, and District 912 Nigeria was not left out in the ceremony just as it was done all around the world. In the line of activities to mark the day, Inner Wheel District 912 Nige­ria visited Isolo General Hospital where they gift­ed 20 expectant mothers with baby and mother kits each, with virtually all the necessities needed after birth included in the pack. Also, they visited the two babies of the New Year born at the same time in just minutes apart after 12 midnight on December 31. The two babies were pre­sented with gifts and cash.

At the vocational centre, Inner Wheel donated three wheelchairs to the Spinal Cord Injuries Association of Nigeria (SCAM); also, they gave out one wheel­chair to 16 years old Master Chinedu Egenti, who was born paralysed, among other empowerments on that day. Speaking during the day-long activities, Chair­man of Inner Wheel Dis­trict 912 Nigeria, IWM Ade­funke Olubunmi Shinaba, said the Founders’ Day was being marked globally, not­ing that in the spirit of em­powering people, they de­cided to visit the hospital, among other places. “This is being celebrat­ed globally because Inner Wheel is 98 years old today. In our nature of reaching and empowering, we decid­ed to come to this hospital, which is not the first time we come here. Because our theme for this year is ‘Pink First’ and that is to take care of women, we decided to visit the pregnant wom­en at this hospital with the baby and mother kits. They will live and their children will live,” she said.
