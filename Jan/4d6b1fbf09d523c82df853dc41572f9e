According to NUJ Chairman, “one significant thing about these donors is that their donations came as a surprise because the committee has yet to approach them for support but were earlier aware of Baba’s exit before condolence letters/messages were received from them some hours after the news was broken.” The chairman prayed God to increase His protection over the lives of all veterans journalists, active journalists, friends and families of the Union in Nigeria.
