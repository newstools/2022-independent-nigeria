A former political advis­er to ex-Governor Victor Attah, Mr Imo Udo has ad­vocated for a youthful suc­cessor for Governor Udom Emmanuel in 2023. To this end, the political enthusiast has charged Akwa Ibom elders to take the back seat and allow the youths to run the state with new ideas and energy. In a chat with newsmen in Uyo on Monday, Udo said the youths have the needed verve to successfully navigate through the increasing laby­rinth of politics, governance and development.
