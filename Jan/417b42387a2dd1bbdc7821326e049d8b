The statement by LIDER reads in part: “One of the ways to identify that an administration is pro-people is the kind of programmes and policies being put in place by the administration. “The reduction of charges on ATM withdrawal is one of the policies that are targeted at reducing the economic burden on the poor. “This decision by the CBN is therefore a confirmation that President Buhari’s administration has the interest of the poor at heart. It is a commendable decision.”
