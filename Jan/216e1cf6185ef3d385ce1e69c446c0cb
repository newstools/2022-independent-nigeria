LAGOS – The Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) has urged Ndigbo to storm Umuahia High Court on Wednesday when the leader of IPOB, Nnamdi Kanu’s case will come up for hearing. The group, in a press statement on Sunday emphasized that there will be no sit-at-home on Wednesday, January 19, when a High Court in Abia State will deliver judgment on the suit by its leader, Nnamdi Kanu. It will be recalled that Kanu had challenged what he called a violation of his human rights and the 2017 military invasion of his family home.

A statement by Ejimakor last week, titled, “Mazi Nnamdi Kanu’s Fundamental Rights suit fixed for judgment on 19th January, 2022,” recalled that the suit was heard and concluded on the merits on December 10, 2021 before Justice Benson Anya of the High Court of Abia State in Umuahia. But, IPOB members had quickly declared the day a sit-at-home despite repeated claims by the leadership that the mandate is illegal. In a broadcast on Radio Biafra 102.1FM on Saturday, by Mazi Chika Edoziem of the IPOB Directorate of State, the IPOB leadership said rather than staying at home, “Biafrans” should mobilise and storm the Court in Umuahia in their numbers.
